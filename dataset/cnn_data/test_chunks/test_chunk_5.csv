"(CNN)Call it a little piece of heaven for a family torn apart by tragedy. Back in July, Sierra Sharry and Lane Smith were just about to become parents.  Sharry was eight months pregnant. But then Smith fell and hit his head.  He was taken to the OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City.  Smith never recovered. ""July 13th 2014 was the absolute worst day of my life,"" Sharry posted on Facebook.  ""I lost my best friend. The father of my unborn child."" Their son Taos arrived a few weeks later. When it was time for his 6-month pictures, Sharry had a special request. Maybe the photographer could make their family complete, just for one picture . ""They asked me if I would be willing to 'play around' with capturing their first family photo by editing Taos' daddy in one of their pictures,"" Kayli Rene' Photography posted on Facebook. ""I just got to thinking, we don't have a picture with Lane in it,"" the new mom told CNN affilaite KOCO. The photographer wasn't sure it would work, but they found just the right picture of Smith -- one that has him looking over his family's shoulder. ""Lane's not physically here with us, of course, but that picture represents to us that he is always watching over us and he will always be there for us no matter what,"" Sharry said. The family photo has become a social media sensation after appearing on the photographer's Facebook page this week. It has some 193,000 likes and more than 24,000 shares. ""I can't believe she actually did this,"" Sharry said.  ""It's like amazing and apparently everyone else thinks it is too.""","Sierra Sharry was eight months pregnant when her son's father died .

"(CNN)By now, you probably have a position regarding the controversy over Indiana's religious freedom law. You applaud the growing chorus of companies blasting the law as an invitation for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians, using religion as a cover. Or, like Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, you are surprised at the backlash and maintain that it is basically a copy of a law that is already in the books at the federal level and 19 other states. The issue drives a wedge because, well, the debate over religious freedom and gay rights is always heated, but also because the interpretations and motives behind the law can be questioned. Whichever side you're on, here are five things you might not have considered when thinking about this controversy. These points might not change your mind, but offer context to better understand the uproar. As the author of the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), Sen. Chuck Schumer is one who can offer clarity over the controversy surrounding Indiana's version of the law. Schumer mocks Indiana's contention that the state law is simply a mirror of the 22-year-old federal law. ""That may be true only if you're using a Funhouse mirror,"" Schumer wrote on his Facebook page. The federal law was intended to protect individual's religious freedom from government intervention, he said. The Indiana law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom, he contends. Also, the law was envisioned to protect the religious freedoms of individuals, while the Indiana law also protects private companies, Schumer said. So, how can the law's supporters claim it is basically a copy of the federal law? If you look at the purpose of the law, the language in the federal and Indiana religious freedom laws are indeed  nearly indistinguishable. In short --  the government cannot interfere with a person's religious practices unless there is a compelling government interest to do so. The uproar is over that fact that the Indiana law expands the reach of the religious protections to include private companies and cases where the government is not involved. Other states previously passed their own version of the religious freedom law -- Indiana became the 20th. But other state laws mirror the federal law much more closely than the Indiana law does. The key difference in the Indiana law is that it expands the instances where someone can use religious freedom as a defense. This is how it could make a difference: . In 2006, Vanessa Willock contacted a photographer about shooting her commitment ceremony with her partner. This was in New Mexico, a state with a religious freedom law at the time of the dispute. The company, Elane Photography, refused the job because of the co-owner's religious beliefs. Willock sued Elane Photography for discrimination, and the company defended itself by citing the law. The photography studio lost the case because the court ruled that it could not use the religious freedom law because the dispute was between two private parties and not a government entity. What would happen if that case happened today in Indiana, with the new, expanded religious freedom law? For sure, the case would have proceeded to trial, said Tim Holbrook, a law professor at Emory University. The photography studio would have had the chance to make its argument in court that it denied the service because of religious reasons. Would the outcome have been the same? Would an Indiana jury side with the company that refused service to a couple because of their sexual orientation? In a letter expressing concern about the Indiana law, a group of 30 legal scholars argued that what Indiana has done is expanded the scope of the law to the point that religious considerations might trump discrimination concerns. ""In our expert opinion, the clear evidence ... unmistakably demonstrates that the broad language of the proposed state RFRA will more likely create confusion, conflict, and a wave of litigation that will threaten the clarity of religious liberty rights in Indiana while undermining the state's ability to enforce other compelling interests,"" the letter, whose signatories included many Indiana law professors, stated. These concerns are based on speculation of what might happen, said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law. Yes, the Indiana law makes it clear that individuals and private companies can use the religious freedom law as a defense, he said. ""But, just because you raise the defense does not mean it will be successful."" Those who try to defend their discriminatory actions in court tend to lose, Blackman said. In his opinion, if Elane Photography had been able to use the law as a defense in New Mexico, it still likely would have lost the case. What's clear is that Indiana's law increases the potential pool of people who can defend themselves claiming religious freedom. The success of such arguments is to be seen. In the meantime, some are already hatching plans on how to test the law, including Bill Levin, founder of The First Church Of Cannabis, who argued on CNN that the law should protect his right to smoke pot. Much is being made of the fact that the first religious freedom law was signed by President Bill Clinton more than 20  years ago. There was bipartisan support in 1993, so why the commotion over a similar law in 2015, some ask? Context, timing and intent have changed the way these laws are viewed. The federal law was written by two Democrats, Schumer and the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. Today, it is being championed by Republicans. The law came into being after two Native Americans in Oregon were fired from their jobs at a rehab clinic because they had consumed peyote, the hallucinogenic cactus. They were denied unemployment benefits, and they sued the state, claiming that the peyote was part of their religious customs. They lost the case. There was outrage over the decision, and the law was created as a remedy. As envisioned by its authors, it would protect the freedoms of religious minorities. Over the years, the law helped a number of people -- a Muslim prisoner won the right to grow a short beard, a Santeria priest was allowed to sacrifice a goat on special religious occasions, and a Native American boy received an exception to his school's policy banning long hair on boys. The law was on the books for years, with little attention paid to it. But Holbrook says it is no coincidence that the religious freedom laws became popular at the state level just as the gay rights and marriage equality movement made historic steps. Many states are using the laws to carve out exceptions to allow Christians to deny services to same-sex couples. Holbrook said. ""The timing is beyond a coincidence,"" he said. ""We are having an interest in RFRA at the time same-sex marriage is coming forward."" Though not enshrined in the law, critics accuse the states pursuing the laws of using them to justify discrimination by the majority religion. Blackman said the history of the state religious freedom laws shows that they have not turned into conduits for discrimination. The expanded laws might mean more people will defend themselves using it, but most will likely lose, he said. ""The moral outrage over this reflects how uninformed people are on the history of the RFRA,"" he said. So we've established that the biggest difference between the federal law and the Indiana law is the scope: In Indiana, the law can be raised as a defense in private disputes, while the federal law applies only to government matters. Not so fast. According to Blackman, the interpretations of the federal religious freedom law are not uniform. Four U.S. circuit courts of appeals have ruled that the federal law can be used as a defense in cases involving private parties. Two other appeals courts have ruled that this is not allowed. And then, there is the Hobby Lobby case. Hobby Lobby, citing the federal religious freedom law, argued that it should not have to provide contraception coverage through insurance to its employees via Obamacare because it was against the owners' beliefs. And, Hobby Lobby won the case before the Supreme Court. The ruling, in effect, expanded the reach of the federal law to include a business. The Hobby Lobby decision, plus the appeals courts rulings, may have opened the door for states like Indiana to be explicit about its expansion of the law. One way to look at it, Blackman said, is that Indiana simply clarified and codified something that is hazy in the federal courts. The outrage over the Indiana law is that it can be used to deny services to the LGBT community on the ground of religious beliefs. Some may rightfully ask, ""Where was the outrage before the religious freedom law?"" Indiana does not have an nondiscrimination law that protects people based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In that sense, the religious freedom law is not necessary for those who want to discriminate against gays and lesbians. Even before the controversial Indiana law was passed, if a restaurant denied service to a gay couple, the couple might be able to sue, but not for discrimination. For that matter, there is also no federal law that protects the LGBT community. According to the Human Rights Campaign, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are sometimes fired, denied a promotion or harassed in the workplace. And their recourse is limited. With the proliferation of religious freedom state laws, nondiscrimination laws become even more important. Another hypothetical outcome of the New Mexico case involving the lesbian couple and the photography studio. If New Mexico had the same religious freedom law as Indiana, the case would have gone to trial. But New Mexico has a nondiscrimination law that protects the LGBT community, it and it would have provided a strong counter-argument to the religious freedom claim. In Indiana, that protection would be lacking. (It gets more complicated when some local governments, like the city of Indianapolis, do have nondiscrimination ordinances). For this reason, Holbrook suggests that a ""fix"" for the Indiana law would be the passage of a nondiscrimination law. Or, at the very least, an exception written into the religious freedom bill that protects from such discrimination.","The controversy over Indiana's religious freedom law is complicated .

"(CNN)Some fans of Lucille Ball want her statue removed from a park in her hometown, saying the ""ugly"" likeness does not do justice to the ""I Love Lucy"" star. The life-size bronze statue in Celoron, New York, has been likened to Conway Twitty, the snake from ""Beetlejuice"" and actor Steve Buscemi, among other unflattering comparisons. Even Mayor Scott Schrecengost has gone on record saying he does not care for the statue, which shows the comic star holding a bottle of fictional nutrition elixir Vitameatavegamin. And yet, it has been a tourist draw since 2009 for Celoron, the comedian's birthplace, attracting visitors who pose with the statue for pictures. A resident of Jamestown, where Ball grew up, started the Facebook page in 2012 ""We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue,"" seeking to get rid of the ""ugly"" statue. A story about the group on Yahoo! News this week spread through the internet, reviving debate over what to do with the statue. The founder of the Facebook group would like to see the statue replaced with a new one outside a planned Comedy Hall of Fame in Jamestown, home to the Lucy-Desi Museum & Center for Comedy and the annual Lucille Ball Comedy Festival. The founder requested anonymity, saying the issue is ""not about me; it's about the statue."" ""Lucille Ball was one of the most talented, beautiful, funny women who ever appeared on television; a pioneer, a giant of television. My only goal is to have a sculpture of her in Jamestown which does her justice,"" the group's founder told CNN. ""This statue in Celoron is not fixable. I love my hometown and I Love Lucy. Let's get a new statue that is a real tribute to her memory as the Comedy Queen of Television."" A Buffalo News columnist vouched for the sentiment, saying ""its deranged grimace and jagged teeth inspire more dread than reverence."" ""No one here much likes the statue, and one look tells you why. It looks more like an extra from 'The Walking Dead' than arguably the most famous comic actress of all time,"" Colin Dabkowski wrote Saturday. Still, residents take pride in their claim to fame, ""even if some of them privately wish that the statue commemorating her would be struck by lightning."" The artist who created the statue did not respond to CNN's request for comment. In a post this week, the Facebook group founder said the point was not to ""disparage"" the artist or his work. But, in this case, ""this Lucy statue is just not up to his usual work."" Schrecengost told the local Post-Journal that he reached out to the artist over the years about redoing the statue. ""He finally came back and said he wanted $8,000 to $10,000 to do it. I've also reached out to several other sculptors in the region, and some said they would do it, but we're still looking at about $5,000,"" he told the newspaper. ""We'd like to work with the original sculptor and wish he would stand behind his work enough to step up and fix it for free.""","Facebook group wants Lucille Ball statue replaced with a new one .

"(CNN)The last time Muhammadu Buhari came to power in Nigeria, it was by force. This time it was by the ballot box. Here are five reasons why one of the most fiercely-contested elections in the country's history is so important. For the first time in Nigeria's history, the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections. Muhammadu Buhari, 72, won Nigeria's presidential election, defeating incumbent Goodluck Jonathan by about two million votes. Nigeria is significant because it is the biggest economy and most populous country in Africa; it is also one of Africa's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the United States. This isn't Buhari's first time leading Nigeria -- but it's his first time in nearly 30 years. The reformed dictator is a Sunni Muslim from Nigeria's poorer North, while Jonathan comes from a Christian and animist South that is rich with oil. Buhari's win comes after a long history of military rule, coups and botched attempts at democracy in the country. Many Nigerians told CNN that they saw President Jonathan as an ineffectual leader who was indecisive in dealing with the terror group Boko Haram -- and weak on corruption. Buhari, who was campaigning for the fourth time, capitalized on these weaknesses and some analysts believe that his military background was an advantage for him. Nigerians wanted a strong leader who could keep them safe from Boko Haram's murderous raids -- and Buhari also campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime the last time around. He stressed that Nigeria's security needs to be the next government's focus. His campaign was also fiercely anti-corruption -- he ran under the slogan of ""new broom,"" and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead-up to the vote. The elections were largely predicted to be violent and everyone, Nigerians included, expected the worst. Some families moved abroad and there was sporadic violence across the country in the lead up to the election. But those fears turned out to be mostly unfounded, and the elections held relatively peacefully -- with the exception of attacks in the north of the country, where around 11 people died. Many also praised President Jonathan's gracious and quick concession of defeat as it almost certainly prevented post-election violence. President-elect Buhari said Wednesday in a speech to the nation: ""The eyes of the world were focused on us to see if we can vote in a peaceful way and carry out elections in an orderly manner. ""We have proven to the world that we are a people who have embraced democracy and a people who seek a government by, for and for the people."" On election day, Nigerians queued for hours in hot weather to cast their vote. Some of the biometric reader machines malfunctioned -- including the one at President Jonathan's polling station -- and voting had to be extended into the following day. But the technical issues didn't keep people from voting -- and in Lagos, some voters cast their ballots with the aid of the light from their mobile phones. And even though some card readers didn't work in some places, many say they helped to cut down on vote rigging. Boko Haram isn't the only obstacle facing the new president. The economy, crime and generating enough power to light up the country are other major issues. The pressure will soon be on Buhari to deliver and there will be no excuses. If he fails, Nigerians will be waiting for him at the polls just four short years from now.","Muhammadu Buhari's win marks the first democratic transition of power from a ruling party to the opposition .
Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, is grappling with violent Boko Haram extremists ."
"(CNN)By the elation online and in the streets, you'd think Iran had just won the World Cup. But this is bigger. Iranians erupted in celebration as young people waved flags from their sunroofs, blasted music from stereos and chatted online with the hashtag #IranTalks. The excitement came after a breakthrough nuclear deal with the United States and other world powers that promises to end Iran's international isolation under years of crippling sanctions. Just before midnight on Thursday, Vali Asr street, one of Tehran's main thoroughfares, turned into something like a block party. Car horns blared. Men danced in the middle of traffic. Some people flaunted U.S. dollar bills. It was a fitting double occasion: The agreement was struck on the final day of Persian New Year festivities, symbolizing a fresh start. Milad, a 20-year-old university student among the crowds, told CNN he was happy about the accord but wary about his own future. ""I still believe I'll have a hard time finding a job that pays well, with or without this deal."" Another Tehran resident, Alireza, 37, said ""Things can't get worse than they are so, I'm happy with this news."" ""This is pretty historic and I pray that my children will be able to live in an Iran that can play nice with the international community."" At home that evening, families watched as Iranian state television broadcast U.S. President Barack Obama's speech live, which came for many as a surprise. Some Iranians celebrated the moment by snapping selfies in front of the TV. Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif — who led the Iranian negotiation team — received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. ""Long live Zarif,"" crowds chanted as the vehicle rolled slowly down the packed street, carrying the man who struck the historic deal. Other videos posted to social media showed Zarif mobbed by fans in Switzerland, who yelled ""We love you, Zarif!""

She closely followed the reaction from Iranians around the world and told CNN she saw an ""explosion"" of joy when the deal was finally struck.

"(CNN)A fourth man has been indicted in connection with a plot to provide material support to terrorists and for some of the men to join ISIS, according to an indictment from Brooklyn Federal Court released Monday. Dilkhayot Kasimov was added to a superseding indictment in which three previously arrested men --  Abdurasul Hasanovich Juraboev, Akhror Saidakhmetov, and Abror Habibov -- were charged with two counts of providing support to a foreign terrorist organization. Those three have pleaded not guilty. It is unclear if Kasimov has been arrested. The indictment and a criminal complaint filed last month say Juraboev and Saidakhmetov planned to join ISIS and had purchased airline tickets to Turkey. Saidakhmetov has also been charged with travel document fraud after telling authorities he intended to travel for entertainment purposes, according to the  indictment. He and Habibov were charged with conspiracy to use a firearm to commit a crime. The names: Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West . Habibov is a 30-year-old Uzbekistani citizen, who police say ""helped organize and finance"" the operation. He was arrested in Jacksonville, Florida. Court documents say Habibov operates mall kiosks that sell kitchenware and repair mobile phones. He has locations in Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Habibov was in the United States legally, but overstayed his visa, according to police. Saidakhmetov, 19, lives in Brooklyn with Juraboev, his roommate. They are permanent residents of the United States. Court documents say Saidakhmetov, a citizen of Kazakhstan, worked at Habibov's mall kiosks in three different states in the fall and winter of 2014. Saidakhmetov was arrested last month at John F. Kennedy International Airport while attempting to catch a flight to Turkey, authorities said. The Brooklyn travel agent who booked his ticket said Saidakhmetov came into the agency, wanting to buy a round-trip ticket to Istanbul. Saidakhmetov said he couldn't afford a direct flight, which would have cost $900, so the travel agent booked him a trip connecting in Kiev, Ukraine, for $571. Saidakhmetov purchased the tickets using a New York state ID, the travel agent said. Court documents say Saidakhmetov once posted some comments on video of ISIS executing Iraqi forces. ""Allahu akbar (God is great).  I was very happy after reading this, my eyes joyful so much victory."" The criminal complaint says he told a confidential informant that he wanted to travel to Syria to wage jihad, ""but that his mother had feared that he would do so and took his passport so that he could not travel."" Saidakhmetov called his mother in February and asked for his passport, according to the criminal complaint. ""When asked where he wanted to go, Saidakhmetov responded that, if a person has a chance to join Islamic State and does not go there, on judgment day he will be asked why, and that it is a sin to live in the land of infidels,"" the complaint says. ""After Saidakhmetov continued to ask for his passport, his mother hung up the phone."" Saidakhmetov told the informant he would try to get his passport back by telling his mom he was traveling to Uzbekistan to visit relatives. When the informant suggested it might be better to take a direct flight to Turkey, Saidakhmetov responded, ""America is catching, they are very strict now. ... it is better to fool them by flying here and flying there."" There were other recorded conversations. In one from November, Saidakhmetov told Juraboev that he wanted to join the U.S. military so he could share information with ISIS. At the very least, he said, ""he could always open fire on American soldiers and kill as many of them as possible,"" according to the complaint. In another recorded conversation in January, Saidakhmetov told the informant that if he couldn't get travel documents to go to Syria, ""I will just go and buy a machine gun, AK-47, go out and shoot all police."" Later, according to the complaint, he said, ""It is legal in America to carry a gun. We will go and purchase one handgun ... then go and shoot one police officer. Boom. ... Then, we will take his gun, bullets and bulletproof vest ... then, we will do the same with a couple of others. Then we will go to the FBI headquarters, kill the FBI people."" Before his arrest at his Brooklyn home, Juraboev was scheduled to hop a flight to Turkey, the criminal complaint said. He worked at the Gyro King restaurant in Brooklyn and had asked for the weekend off so he could travel. Zak Kahn, owner of Gyro King, said Juraboev was quiet and not given to discussing politics. ""I never heard him -- not even a single sentence -- (talk) about politics, about jihad, about army, about military or force. ... What happened to him? He seemed to be a very peaceful person."" In August, court documents say, Juraboev was active on an Uzbek-language website that promoted ISIS. ""Greetings! We too wanted to pledge our allegiance and commit ourselves while not present there,"" Juraboev, a citizen of Uzbekistan, is said to have posted. ""I am in USA now but we don't have any arms. But is it possible to commit ourselves as dedicated martyrs anyway while here? What I'm saying is, to shoot Obama and then get shot ourselves, will it do? That will strike fear in the hearts of infidels."" The post earned Juraboev a visit from federal agents several days later. Juraboev admitted that he'd posted the message and that he believed in the ISIS agenda. He also said ""that he would harm Obama if he had the opportunity to do so, but currently does not have the means or an imminent plan to do so,"" the complaint says. CNN's Ed Payne, Catherine Shoichet, Ray Sanchez, Rob Freshe, Will Ripley, David Shortell, Julia Talanova, Jason Caroll and Yon Pomrenze contributed to this report.","The revised indictment is released Monday .

"(CNN)The third blood moon in a four-part series was the shortest eclipse of the bunch, but still a sweet treat for early risers in North America. The moon slipped fully into Earth's shadow at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time (7:58 a.m. ET) Saturday, starting a total lunar eclipse for nearly five minutes -- what NASA says will be the shortest such eclipse of the century. The celestial body took on a burnt-orange tint in the minutes before, during and after the total eclipse, giving the moon the appearance that earns total eclipses the ""blood moon"" nickname. Watchers in the eastern half of North America caught only a partial eclipse -- and in some places, an orange one -- before the moon set below the horizon. The event started at 3:16 a.m. PT (6:16 a.m. ET), when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow. ""The lunar eclipse is looking good!"" tweeted Ryan Hoke, a meteorologist for CNN affiliate WAVE in Louisville, Kentucky, showing a picture of a reddish partial moon in a blue dawn sky. People from the U.S. West Coast to Australia were able to catch the total eclipse. Parts of South America, India, China and Russia were able to see at least parts of the event, but it wasn't visible in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Africa or the Middle East. A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color.  Why red? Because Earth's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light. NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a ""tetrad.""  The first was April 15, 2014, and the second was October 23, 2014. The space agency predicts the next one will come September 28. Did you see it?

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN)The questions Turks asked on Tuesday were tinged with fear. ""What's going on? What happened? Why can't I get into the subway?"" asked an elderly woman in a white headscarf with several shopping bags as she stood outside the barricaded entrance to one of Istanbul's busiest subway stations. She was one of millions of Turks left confused and concerned by the worst power outage to grip the country in more than a decade. Dozens of cities across Turkey lost power for hours on Tuesday. Millions of people were affected, including passengers stranded on paralyzed trains and subways. Municipal workers were forced to evacuate Istanbul's Marmaray Tunnel, where the black-out left commuters trapped deep beneath the rushing waters of the Bosphorus Strait. More than 24 hours later, Turkish officials were still at pains to explain the power outage. The energy minister suggested a possible failure in transmission lines. The prime minister did not rule out the possibility of a terror attack. The mysterious collapse of much of the country's energy grid triggered a burst of wild conspiracy theories across social media. Some Twitter users went so far as to suggest the black-outs were a warm up for elections scheduled to take place in June. There is fertile ground for rumor-mongering in Turkey. Over the last five years, security forces have arrested hundreds of army generals, journalists, prosecutors, civil society activists and police commanders and accused them of being members of assorted plots aimed at toppling the government. The government's increasingly heavy-handed repression of public dissent, combined with overt censorship of the media and the internet, have also contributed to a hyper-polarized and deeply mistrustful political atmosphere. Even Turkey's veteran deputy prime minister, Bulent Arinc, recently observed that opposition supporters now look at him ""with hatred"" rather than the grudging respect he enjoyed when his political party first swept to power in elections in 2002. Meanwhile, mysterious black-outs are a sore spot for some Turks, after a surreal 2014 incident on election night -- allegedly involving a feline saboteur. That is -- a cat that allegedly wandered into a power transformer. That was almost exactly a year ago, a smaller series of power outages affected some polling stations during nationwide municipal elections, prompting unsubstantiated accusations of vote rigging. The ruling Justice and Development Party ended up winning by a comfortable margin, but few Turks were reassured by the energy minister's explanation that the voting day black-outs were caused by a cat getting lost. As electricity was just starting to come back on in Istanbul on Tuesday, a second crisis erupted. Websites linked to an extremist leftist militant group known as the DHKP-C began publishing chilling photos of a masked man holding a pistol to the head of a hostage in front of communist flags. Two gunmen had somehow infiltrated the Palace of Justice, the monolithic court house in the center of Istanbul. There they took hostage Mehmet Selim Kiraz, the prosecutor in charge of one of the most politically sensitive trials in the country. The gunmen demanded the confessions of police officers accused of shooting a tear gas canister at Berkin Elvan, a 15-year-old boy who was critically wounded during anti-government protests that raged across Istanbul in 2013. The boy's death after months in a medically-induced coma triggered a fresh burst of protests and riots against the government. On Tuesday, in the midst of the hostage crisis at the court house, the Turkish government imposed a gag order banning broadcasters from reporting on the Palace of Justice siege. The broadcast ban is a measure that the Turkish government has repeatedly used in recent years to stifle reporting on deadly terrorist attacks. The government also famously shut down Twitter and YouTube in an effort to kill highly embarrassing political scandals involving corruption. Ultimately, Tuesday's court house siege ended in a deadly hail of bullets that left both gunmen dead and the prosecutor mortally wounded. Turkish officials say special forces raided the court house only after the militants began shooting. Online and in the streets, some Turks began linking the massive electricity blackouts to the hostage-taking inside one of Turkey's best-protected buildings, even though there is little to suggest the two incidents are connected. Just hours after the shooting, tensions exploded yet again at the court house. Istanbul's police chief had called for a press conference. As journalists jostled their way through security at the entrance to the largely deserted courthouse, some bystanders began chanting ""government thieves."" Just hours after a devastating lapse of security at the Palace of Justice, police began detaining the demonstrators hurling abuse at their elected government. The reactions to Tuesday's bewildering series of events revealed several truths about contemporary Turkey. The country is tense and confused after years of back-to-back political crises. Heavy-handed censorship has left the mainstream media widely distrusted and discredited by broad segments of society. And the absence of a common, credible space for sharing information has pushed critics of the government to the fringes of social media. Amid the burst of optimism and civil society activism in the early heady days of the Arab Spring in 2011, Turkey was often cited as a possible democratic model for countries in the Middle East.  Many of those Arab countries have since descended into conflict, repression and instability. In the meantime, Turkey feels increasingly vulnerable to demons of its own making.","This week, Turkey was gripped by a massive power outage and a deadly hostage crisis .

"(CNN)In this Holy Week, let us be reminded of what the word of God says about fair and living wages. Isaiah 58.6 tells us: . This is the kind of fast day I'm after: . to break the chains of injustice, . get rid of exploitation in the workplace, . free the oppressed, . cancel debts. The McDonald's announcement that the company is going to raise wages for 90,000 of its employees is a significant victory for fast-food cooks and cashiers and those of us who support them. By standing up together, fast-food workers are making it less acceptable for profitable companies like McDonald's to pay wages so low that its workers are boxed into poverty. But this action, which would raise starting wages at 1,500 McDonald's-owned restaurants to at least $1 an hour more than the minimum wage set by local law, falls short in three important ways . First, it leaves out the vast majority of McDonald's workers. The announcement only affects 10% of the McDonald's restaurants in the United States, ignoring the employees who work at franchised McDonald's restaurants. That means hundreds of thousands of workers serving Big Macs and fries won't see a dollar more in their paychecks. McDonald's claims that it has no responsibility for those franchises, but its workers, and the National Labor Relations Board, disagree. Secondly, this raise isn't nearly enough. One dollar above the minimum wage isn't enough to make paying for groceries, rent and transportation much easier, especially coming from a company that makes nearly $5 billion a year in profits. It's not enough for clothing or health care. It's not enough, as people of my faith say, for those cooks and cashiers to afford their daily bread. Thirdly, the raise does nothing to help workers have a voice in determining their workplace conditions. McDonald's and other companies need to stop trying to prevent their workers from speaking out together in a union. They should respect workers' right to collectively demand sensible schedules and such basics as adequate first aid kits, and not being compelled to work off the clock. We are at a turning point in American history. We are at a Third Reconstruction. We are at the moment when forces come together to push this country forward toward the goal of a better life for all: sustainable wages, affordable health care, quality education, and, respect for workers' right to stick together in unions so they can be heard. We are wining this fight, and the McDonald's announcement is proof that the momentum is on our side. When all McDonald's workers have more money in their pockets, they will inject money back into their neighborhoods, boosting the entire economy. Instead of houses in foreclosure and hungry children, we would have a rising wage floor and thriving communities that support more jobs. Today, thousands of McDonald's workers live below the federal poverty line. Many get help from government programs, especially food stamps, to make it week to week. Whether we like it or not, our tax dollars help McDonald's keep wages artificially low. This isn't just an economic issue.  It's a moral issue. I've talked to workers at McDonald's restaurants who say they have to skip meals because they don't have enough money. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ""What good is having the right to sit at a lunch counter if you can't afford to buy a hamburger?"" It's time for McDonald's to make sure all the people who serve its burgers are paid enough to afford to eat them for dinner. But we aren't going to wait for divine intervention. We're going to keep organizing and keep fighting until the workers at McDonald's, and every other fast-food restaurant, get what makes sense for their families and our communities: a $15 per hour wage and a path to form a union without interference or retaliation. McDonald's took a small step forward by raising wages for a small minority of the people who run their stores. It's time for the corporation to find a way to raise wages for everyone working in its restaurants so they can pay their bills, put some money back into their community, and expand prosperity and opportunity across our land.","William Barber: McDonald's will raise minimum wage $1 for 10% of workers. This is a step in right direction but falls short in three ways .
He says it leaves out 90% of workers, is not enough to lift workers from poverty, company prevents workers from speaking out in a union ."
"(CNN)The Golden State could soon refer to the hue of California's lawns. Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday imposed mandatory water restrictions for the first time on residents, businesses and farms, ordering cities and towns in the drought-ravaged state to reduce usage by 25%. ""We're in a new era,"" Brown said. ""The idea of your nice little green grass getting lots of water every day, that's going to be a thing of the past."" The 25% cut in usage amounts to roughly 1.5 million acre-feet of water (an acre foot of water equals about 325,000 gallons) over the next nine months, state officials said. ""This historic drought demands unprecedented action,"" Brown said, standing on a patch of dry, brown grass in the Sierra Nevada mountains that is usually blanketed by up to 5 feet of snow. The reduction in water use does not apply to the agriculture industry, except for the requirement that it report more information on its groundwater use. The exclusion prompted some criticism, as agriculture uses about 80% of California's developed water supply. Farms in the state have taken a hit, with reduced water allocations and thousands of farmworkers laid off. But climate writer Eric Holthaus of Slate wrote that ""wasteful agriculture is literally sucking California dry."" The action comes as the Sierra Nevada snowpack, which Californians rely on heavily during the summer for their water needs, is near a record low. One famed golf course group said it should be able to keep its fairways and greens green. David Stivers, an executive vice president of the Pebble Beach company, said his company is studying the restrictions to see what effect it will have on business. ""It will not affect our golf course irrigation because we use recycled waste water (for golf course irrigation) from a plant we built in 1994,"" he said. The company operates Pebble Beach Golf Links, Spyglass Hill Golf Course and The Links at Spanish Bay as well as three hotels. He said the drought has yet to hurt revenue. ""People up here are also very conscious about water usage and the expense of water in this area,"" he said. Pepperdine University in Malibu, known for its beautiful campus, said it would be challenging to meet the restrictions given the water-saving practices already in effect.  The school already uses recycled and reclaimed water for campus irrigation and now it has turned off all fountains on campus, according to Rhiannon Bailard, director of the university's Center for Sustainability. The university was also encouraging students to further reduce water usage. In addition, Brown's executive order will: . • Impose significant cuts in water use on campuses, golf courses, cemeteries and other large landscapes. • Replace 50 million square feet of lawns throughout the state with ""drought-tolerant landscaping."" • Create a temporary, statewide consumer rebate program to replace old appliances with water efficient models. • Prohibit new homes and developments from irrigating with potable water unless water-efficient drip irrigation systems are used. • Ban watering of ornamental grass on public street medians. • Require agricultural water users to report more water use information to state regulators, increasing the state's ability to enforce against illegal diversions and waste. ""It's a different world,"" Brown said Wednesday. ""We have to act differently."" A staggering 11 trillion gallons are needed for California to recover from the emergency. The estimate is based on NASA satellite data analysis of how much water the state's reserves lack. That's more than 14,000 times the amount of water it would take to fill the Dallas Cowboys stadium, according to CNN calculations. It's the amount of water that flows over Niagara Falls in about 170 days' time. The entire state faces at least a moderate drought, and more than half of the state faces the worst category of dryness, called an exceptional drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. California isn't the only state feeling an absence of rain. As of late September, 30% of the Lower 48 faced at least a moderate drought, particularly in the Southwest states neighboring California and in Texas, the Drought Monitor says. But none of those states is facing the extremes of California, where the drought has been a slowly building natural disaster since 2012. In fact, Brown last year declared a state emergency, saying his constituents are facing ""perhaps the worst drought that California has ever seen since records (began) about 100 years ago."" Opinion: The end of the LA lawn . On September 16, Brown signed ""historic legislation"" that created ""a framework for sustainable, local groundwater management for the first time in California history,"" the governor's office said. Before the new legislation, California was the only Western state that didn't manage its groundwater, officials said. Last month, Brown unveiled an emergency $1 billion spending plan to tackle the state's historic drought. According to the State Water Resources Control Board, the package will specifically accelerate $128 million from the governor's budget to provide direct assistance to workers and affected communities. Proposition 1 funding, which enacted the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, will funnel $272 million into safe drinking water efforts and maintenance of water recycling infrastructure. Some $660 million from Prop 1 will also be accelerated for flood protection in urban and rural areas. As part of the changes, Brown said additional measures will crack down on water inefficiency as California enters the fourth year of a worsening water crisis. The March snowpack measurement came in at 0.9 inches of water content in the snow, just 5% of the March 3 historical average for the measurement site. The overall water content for the Northern Sierra snowpack came in at 4.4 inches, just 16% of average for the date. Central and southern Sierra readings were 5.5 inches (20% of average) and 5 inches (22% of average) respectively. Only in 1991 has the water content of the snow been lower.

"London (CNN)Time's running out for Britons to decide who they'll back, as polling booths prepare to open across the country in an election that could change the political landscape. It's been a blink-and-you-miss-it campaign, especially by U.S. standards, where candidates can take years to finesse their messages. The election could result in the handing of power from David Cameron's Conservative government to the Labour Party, led by Ed Miliband -- or a frenzy of wrangling from leaders as they attempt to forge alliances with smaller parties. But that's all to come when polls close late Thursday evening, local time. Very strict rules govern the reporting of UK elections, but until they kick in, here are some things you should know -- who are the candidates, what are the issues, who's likely to win, why bacon sandwiches matter, what is ""UKIP"" and, if the Queen isn't in charge, what does she do? The Queen doesn't run Britain . Before we get on to the candidates, let's dispel one common misconception. Queen Elizabeth II is officially Britain's head of state, but she's only nominally in charge. She signs off on legislation and appoints new prime ministers but has no real power, so no beheadings but maybe a few disapproving stares. Officially, she's politically neutral. The closest she apparently comes to expressing opinion is -- savor this image -- ""purring"" like a cat. Visit: Windsor Castle, the Queen's country residence (Windsor and Maidenhead; +44 20 7766 7304), royalcollection.org.uk/visit/windsorcastle . So who are they voting for? Duh, they're voting for a new prime minister. Well, actually no. In presidential elections Americans vote in each state for ""electors,"" who support the candidate they want to lead the country. But in a UK parliamentary the vote is more indirectly aimed at appointing a new government. Voters put their ""X"" next to the local stooge/aspiring public servant from whichever political party they support. Votes are tallied by constituencies -- political fiefdoms, really -- some of which date back centuries to when Britain was run by barons, or maybe even elves -- each with a seat in parliament. The party that wins most seats then gets to say who becomes prime minister, pending the final thumbs up from Her Majesty. Of course, in reality, people may be swayed by party figureheads and see voting as a direct endorsement of their leadership, personality or -- true things -- their ability to eat bacon sandwiches and point at fish. Visit: Hampstead Heath -- a beautiful north London green space that lies partly within the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency, likely to be one of the most hotly contested of the election. (South Hill Park Gardens, London; +44 20 7332 3322). Is that a fair system? Kinda. But also kinda not, since it means a party can easily win power without winning the most votes. That's because Britain's elections are run on a ""first-past-the-post"" basis. It's an analogy that highlights how similar British politics is to horse racing, just with fewer doping scandals. Here's how it works: . The elected parliament consists of 650 seats, each representing a different number of constituents -- anywhere between 21,000 and 110,000. Only the candidate who wins most votes in each constituency gets a seat. No prizes for second place. Of course there have been reform demands from smaller parties stiffed by the system, but since they never win against the two main parties, they're powerless to change anything. The centrist Liberal Democrats, for instance, had 6.8 million votes (23% of the total) at the last election, but won just 57 seats. The Conservatives claimed 307 with just 10.7 million votes. Visit: Luskentyre beach, Isle of Harris. The stunning islands of the Outer Hebrides, off the western coast of mainland Scotland, are part of the UK's smallest constituency by voter numbers. visitscotland.com/info/towns-villages/luskentyre-sands . So who's going to win? British elections are typically viewed as a two-horse race -- an analogy that highlights how similar they are to races involving two horses, only with fewer horses. The prime candidates are incumbent David Cameron, head of the center-right Conservatives, and Ed Miliband, leader of the center-left Labour Party. Opinion polls say there's no clear favorite. That'll mean -- as it did in 2010 -- that the spoils of victory could be claimed by whoever can successfully horse (yes, horse) trade to build a majority coalition alongside smaller parties. If that happens, eyes will be on the smaller parties including the Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats and the upstart UK Independence Party. UKIP's leader Nigel Farage is a political outsider who's won support for being anti-immigration, anti-Europe and pro-beer. His party isn't expected to win many seats, but it could result in some unlikely romancing -- as the last vote did when the LibDems hopped into bed with the Conservatives, much to the anger of some supporters. Visit: Ascot Racecourse. Enough with the horse analogies already. Check out the real thing at the Queen's favorite track. High Street, Ascot, West Berkshire, ascot.co.uk . What are the issues? There's the future of Britain's cherished yet financially challenged National Health Service -- the free medicare system that's undergone so many botched political procedures in recent years, it can barely bring itself to take off the bandages. UKIP's rise has spurred uncomfortable cross-party pledges to beef up controls to end decades of population-swelling immigration, a concern, apparently, among Britain's descendants of Viking, Norman, Roman and Anglo-Saxon invaders. There's the economy -- how to tackle Britain's budget deficit and foster financial recovery (without relying on the cheap immigrant labor that the politicians want to stop entering.) And there's Europe -- another UKIP-generated issue that has forced the main parties into posturing against the European Union, even though many supporters suspect withdrawing would be disastrous, not just for the economy, but for future fish-pointing opportunities. Visit: The White Cliffs of Dover, a potent symbol that marks Britain's frontier with the rest of the world. Dover, Kent; +44 1304 207326, whitecliffsofdover.co.uk . Think this all sounds too boring for words? You're not the only one, which is a major problem for the politicians seeking election. Political apathy is on the rise in the UK, with many younger voters expressing disillusionment with party leaders they say are out of touch and barely distinguishable from one another, even if one ""looks like a panda"" and the other a ""pink condom."" It doesn't help the politicians' cause when popular comedians such as Russell Brand denounce voting in favor of an as-yet unspecified ""revolution."" However, he later changed his mind after meeting Miliband, and urged people to vote Labour. Still, UK elections aren't without their entertainment -- most notably provided by fringe candidates. From 1963 until 1995, a feature of every vote count was Screaming Lord Sutch, an odd-looking pop star whose Official Monster Raving Loony Party campaigned for many lost causes that later became reality, such as commercial radio and the scrapping of dog licenses. In the 2010 election other eccentric candidates included Lord Biro, who campaigned on policies that included the appointment of Bono as Pope. Mad Cap'n Tom also pledged to train schoolchildren in ""swordsmanship and gunnery"" by imposing a 50% tax on downloads of Cheryl Cole songs ""because I hate Cheryl Cole."" Whatever their motivation, come election night when they get their moment on stage with serious political rivals, they often get better laughs than Brand. Visit: Margate. This charming English seaside town is where Farage will be standing for election. Among his opponents is Al Murray -- a comedian whose boorish stage character, ""Pub Landlord,"" shares many of the UKIP leader's views.

"(CNN)This is the time of the year when Christians the world over -- more than 2 billion of us -- reflect upon the crucifixion and resurrection of our Lord. In light of the tragic massacre of Christian college students in Kenya on Thursday, and the ongoing threat against Christians in other nations, this Holy Week  we are calling upon Christians to also reflect upon the crucifixion, beheading, stoning, enforced slavery, sexual abuse, human trafficking, harassment, bombing and displacement of hundreds of thousands of Christians -- and others -- whose faith alone has made them a target of religious extremists. Countless lives have been utterly destroyed in nations such as Iraq, Syria, Libya, Pakistan, India, Egypt, Kenya and Nigeria. In June 2012, Bishop Shlemon Warduni of Iraq told the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, ""We beg you to help. We want only peace, security, and freedom. Please no more death, no more explosions, no more injustice."" By then, nearly every remaining church in Iraq had constructed a blast wall around its building to buffet the threat of the inevitable church bombing. This crisis escalated substantially last summer when ISIS swept like lightning through Iraq's Nineveh province, capturing the country's second-largest city, Mosul; a city that was until 2014 a home of a thriving Christian community, there centuries before Islam. Again and again the world did not respond as it might have, and now the inconceivable has happened: Iraq's Nineveh Plain has been emptied of its ancient Christianity community, which existed there for more than 1,500 years. On March 27, in a presentation to the U.N. Security Council, Chaldean Catholic Patriarch Louis Raphael Sako referred to the present reality of his fellow Iraqi Christians as a ""catastrophic situation."" He's right. Rarely since the first century has the church in the East faced persecution on this scale. Christian communities that took 2,000 years to build, and that were started by the apostles themselves, lie in ashes between the Tigris and the Euphrates. Survivors waste away as refugees, often in deplorable conditions, with no homes or churches to return to if the region eventually stabilizes. Whether they be Catholic, Orthodox or Protestant, Christian communities are united in what Pope Francis has called an ""ecumenism of blood,"" recognizing that Christianity is experiencing more martyrdom today than in the first century. This is not an exaggerated or contrived crisis. As Nina Shea, director of the Hudson's Institute's Center for Religious Freedom, has aptly put it, ""Piece by piece, Middle Eastern Christianity is being shattered."" Our concern is not to the exclusion of anyone else under threat by these religious fanatics, and we reject those who believe that this evil is reflective of the majority of Muslims whose community has actually experienced the most casualties in this conflict. It is also true that Christianity faces a legitimate threat of extinction in several parts of Iraq and Syria and it faces a growing threat in nations such as Nigeria. In solidarity with those being threatened we agree with the words delivered by Jordan's King Abdullah II at the United Nations last fall, ""Christians are an integral part of [the Middle East's] past, present and future."" When history writes of our time will we be able to say that we tried everything in our power to cease this attempt to eliminate 2,000 years of Christianity from the Middle East and to stop this threat before it spreads to other nations? These communities need our love and support like never before, and they also need security and protection from the world like never before. This Easter we reflect upon the words of a Christian who was himself beheaded for his faith alone. He converted to Christianity one day on a road to Damascus, Syria, when his name was changed from Saul to Paul. In a letter to Christians living in another dangerous place in another persecuted time, he wrote, ""Pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people."" This Easter, let us earnestly pray with all the love of Christ for all those in harm's way.","Rarely since the first century have Christians faced persecution on this scale, say Dolan, Downey and Burnett.
Crisis escalated substantially as ISIS has swept through Iraq's Nineveh province, the authors write."
"(CNN)The racist and offensive emails that resulted in three Ferguson, Missouri, city employees either resigning or being fired have been released. The exchanges between the city's top court clerk and two police officers were discovered during a U.S. Justice Department investigation of racial prejudice in the city's police and judicial system. The emails -- which make offensive references to President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama as well as Muslims and minorities --  were obtained by the Washington Post on Thursday after a public records request. CNN reviewed them Friday. Police Capt. Rick Henke and Sgt. William Mudd resigned early last month after the emails were discovered as part of the evidence in the Justice Department's scathing Ferguson report. The city's top court clerk, Mary Ann Twitty, was fired in connection with the emails, officials said. One email showed Ronald Reagan, an actor before becoming President, feeding a chimp in the 1951 comedy ""Bedtime for Bonzo,"" with the caption: ""Rare photo of Ronald Reagan babysitting Barack Obama in 1962."" Another showed a photo of bare-chested dancing women, apparently in Africa, with the caption ""Michelle Obama's High School Reunion!"" A June 2011 email described a man trying to put his dogs on welfare because the canines were ""mixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can't speak English and have no ... clue who their Daddies are."" Some critics have called for the department to be disbanded. Last month, embattled Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned one week after the scathing Justice Department report slammed his department. Jackson will receive a severance payment and health insurance for one year, city officials said. Opinion: Change is coming to Ferguson . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder ordered the Ferguson police investigation after a white police officer, Darren Wilson, shot and killed black teenager Michael Brown last summer, setting off months of sometimes violent street protests in the town outside St. Louis. The DOJ declined to bring charges against Wilson, who has since left the force. No state charges were filed. In a separate report, the Justice Department described what it said was a ""pattern and practice"" of discrimination against African-Americans by the Ferguson police and municipal courts. That discrimination included racist emails. Ferguson is a town of 21,000 that is 67% African-American. Among the findings in the report: . From 2012 to 2014, 85% of people subject to vehicle stops by Ferguson police were African-American, 90% of those who received citations were blac and 93% of people arrested were black. In 88% of the cases in which Ferguson police officers reported using force, it was against African-Americans. From 2012-2014 black drivers were twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during traffic stops, but 26% less likely to be found in possession of contraband.

"(CNN)Two people, one of them a licensed greyhound trainer, have been arrested in Australia after at least 55 dog carcasses were found dumped in Queensland bush, according to Australian media reports. Two Bundaberg residents, a 71-year old man and a 64-year old woman, were each charged with one count of unlawful possession of a firearm, broadcaster ABC reported. The woman, a licensed trainer, was also charged with obstructing police. Michael Beatty, spokesman for RSPCA Queensland, told ABC that inquiries were continuing. The animal rights organization is assisting Queensland police in their investigation. ""A lot of people in the area who were involved in the greyhound industry were questioned, and it was as a result of information given to us that the joint Queensland Police Service and RSPCA investigation team made those arrests,"" he said. At a press conference Thursday, Queensland Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller described the discovery of the carcasses, which followed a tip-off from a member of the public, as sickening. ""What I believe has happened here has been the mass murder of 55 greyhounds outside of Bundaberg,"" she said. She promised a zero tolerance approach to animal abuse. ""The people who have perpetrated this crime, to me, are oxygen thieves, they are cowards and they are pathetic."" Detective Superintendent Mark Ainsworth said the crime scene was ""nothing short of abhorrent."" ""Some of the greyhounds were in different states of decay and that would sort of indicate to us that they've been dumped there over varying periods of time,"" he said. ""The postmortem will reveal the cause of death of these dogs. However I will comment that a number of spent .22 cartridge shells were found in the vicinity."" He said there had been a number of bushfires in the area surrounding the dumping site, which would also be factored into the investigation. Beatty said it appeared the dogs would have been culled by people involved in greyhound racing. ""There's always been a lot of wastage in the greyhound industry,"" he said in a statement. ""The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know."" Australia's greyhound racing industry has been under intense scrutiny since a television investigation revealing the illegal use of live bait in training dogs aired in February. The investigation, on the ABC network, showed footage of trainers fixing live possums, piglets and rabbits to lures to be chased and mauled to death by dogs, prompting a wave of bans and suspensions from the sport. Australians wager AU$4 billion ($3.03 billion) a year on greyhound racing, according to the ABC report. Ainsworth said the Queensland police had established a joint taskforce with the RSPCA to investigate the industry in the wake of the report. ""We've not even tipped the iceberg as yet,"" he said, appealing for those involved in the industry to come forward. ""You know who you are, you know what you've been involved in, and now is the time to stand up and be counted,"" he said. ""It will only be a matter of time before we get around to knocking on everyone's door."" Racing Queensland did not respond to a request for comment. CNN's Chieu Luu contributed to this report.","Australian police have arrested two people after the discovery of 55 greyhound carcasses in bushland .

"(CNN)Two years ago in a less turbulent time, Mike Premeau and Kathy Danke launched a small business, Memories Gourmet Pizza Co., in their Wisconsin town. The two were successful in getting their line of frozen pizzas, including breakfast pizzas and gluten-free options, in stores across Nichols, west of Green Bay. They grew a base of loyal customers. But all that was threatened this week when people began mistaking them for Memories Pizza of Walkerton, Indiana, which made national headlines after its owners said they would refuse to cater a same-sex wedding. People posted angry comments on Memories Gourmet Pizza's Facebook page and called its phone number to protest. And almost overnight, Premeau and Danke found themselves thrust unwillingly into a national debate over Indiana's controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act. ""My stomach was in my throat all afternoon,"" Danke told CNN affiliates WBND and WFRV. ""All of a sudden, our Facebook page started getting flooded,"" Premeau said. ""I was shocked. It was like I was a rat running around in a cage, wondering what's going on here."" In a cruel coincidence, the flood of outrage began on Wednesday, April Fool's Day. ""If I'm ever in the area, I'll be sure to starve to death before I give you and you intolerance any of my money!"" wrote one commenter on Facebook. ""I don't have much of a message, except that I hope your bigotry puts you out of business very quickly,"" a man said in a voice mail. Indiana pizzeria finds itself at the center of 'religious freedom' debate . Premeau thinks the firestorm was sparked by people Googling ""Memories Pizza"" and confusing the two businesses -- despite the fact that Nichols and Walkerton are in separate states and almost 300 miles apart. He and Danke tried to defuse the outcry with a Facebook post saying in part, ""We are not that company in Indiana, nor do we agree or condone their words or actions."" In response, they began getting messages of support on Facebook, along with a few sharp-tongued comments from supporters of the other Memories Pizza. Premeau said he also got a call from a man whose initial post may have set off the social media storm, apologizing for the mistake. Still, he worries that damage to his wholesale pizza business may have been done. ""This misinformation and this defamation of character could cause me to lose the business over someone else's identity in another state,"" he said.","A Wisconsin pizzeria is harassed by people confusing it with one in Indiana .

"(CNN)The complete skeleton of a camel thought to to have been used by Ottoman troops besieging Vienna in the 17th century has been found beneath a cellar in Austria. The remains were uncovered by archaeologists from the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna (Vetmeduni), exploring the construction site for a shopping center in the city of Tulln in 2006-2007. ""The partly excavated skeleton was at first suspected to be a large horse or cattle,"" archaeozoologist Alfred Galik said. ""But one look at the cervical vertebrae, the lower jaw and the metacarpal bones immediately revealed that this was a camel."" In their research, published in the journal ""PLOS ONE,"" the archaeologists said Ottoman troops had besieged the area around Tulln in 1683 as they tried to reach Vienna, but that Tulln itself had never been conquered. The Ottoman Army had a ""camelry,"" using camels for transportation and to ride, they said. Despite their city not falling, Tulln inhabitants and the Ottomans were in contact, with historic documents referring to the invading army's peaceful surrender of two prisoners of war, the researchers said. But they said it would be impossible to say how it got into the city. ""Its appearance might be linked to an exchange of local people with the troops or the Ottoman army simply left it behind. Apparently, the citizens took it inside the town, where they probably kept and displayed it as an 'exotic animal,'"" they said. ""It seems quite conceivable that being not familiar with behavioral and feeding habits, the scarcity of food in wartimes, people did not keep it for long."" While other camel bones have been found in Central Europe, the researchers said this was unique. ""It is the first complete camel skeleton found in Central Europe and Central European territories under the control of the Ottoman Empire, apart from the complete skeleton of a dromedary recovered from the sediments of the Theodosius harbor on the European part of Istanbul."" DNA analysis on the Tulln skeleton confirmed that it had been one of a hybrid species of camel, specifically a ""Tulu,"" the offspring of dromedary female and a male with Bactrian DNA. ""The two species are able to interbreed, which results in larger, more powerful and efficient hybrid offspring,"" researchers said. ""The camel specimen from Tulln is the first archaeozoologically and genetically confirmed evidence of a Tulu hybrid camel."" The camel was also believed to have been castrated to make it easier to handle. The Austrians' unfamiliarity with such a beast may have led to the skeleton's preservation. As opposed to the Ottoman troops -- who would likely have eaten the camel's flesh -- the residents of Tulln apparently buried the camel whole. ""The dismemberment of the carcasses certainly is a reason for the scarce preservation of camel finds in general and is indicated by bones with butchering marks in particular. However, the citizens buried this camel in a typical post-mortal position, and together with rubbish in the remnants of a cellar that was leveled,"" researchers said. In their report, the researchers said the camel was found on the site of what had been an old tavern called ""Auf der Rossmuhle."" ""The backfill of the cellar yielded masses of domestic refuse like animal bones and ceramics (e.g. plates, pans and flagons), pieces of a tiled stove and enameled pipe bowls which date the filling in the early modern period,"" they said.

"(CNN)We might never truly comprehend what drove co-pilot Andreas Lubitz to crash Germanwings Flight 9525 into the French Alps on March 24, killing everyone on board. The latest report shows that he sped up the descent of the plane to its doom. It's terrifying. As the investigation unfolds, we will learn more about to what extent Lubitz kept his mental illness secret, or how much help he sought. How much did his battle with depression affect his fitness to fly? Should he have walked away from his job? Should his doctors have sounded alarm bells? His case raises larger and important issues about people who are burdened with mental illness and the pressure of its stigma. Too often and for too long, people with mental illness have been regarded by others around them as disasters waiting to happen. When we don't distinguish between people with a mental illness who are dangerous to society and those who are a danger to no one, we reinforce a pernicious idea that's both bad for society and bad for those with mental illness. Some people feel a need to keep their mental illness a secret while others decline to seek help. That's why in our public and more private discourse, people with mental illness and the rest of society must talk about mental illness in a way that doesn't drive some into the darkness. We need to understand this malady as an illness and not a personal failing. And we have to recognize that ""mental illness"" is a broad category encompassing many different challenges that affect people in a variety of ways. People with mental illness are no more violent than the rest of the population and with proper treatment, many can recover and live healthy, productive lives. We must encourage them to open up, and when they do, we must listen to them and take their cries for help seriously. It wasn't that long ago that a diagnosis of cancer was a tightly-kept secret that many victims of the deadly malady kept from family members, friends and especially employers. But that changed dramatically over the years as people with cancer, their family members and caregivers came together to educate and change public opinion about the disease. Similarly, and with the courageous example of Michael J. Fox, we've seen perceptions about Parkinson's disease change for the better, as people learn more about what it is and isn't. Time to talk about depression . That's the kind of transformation we need around perceptions of mental illness through a better-informed public discussion. We have to put policies in place that encourage more openness without the severe repercussions people with mental illness fear. That includes enforcing and even strengthening the kind of protections we already have in place (through laws and regulations like the Americans for Disabilities Act) for individuals who disclose their disability. We also need to address the dilemma health care providers often face when they feel that strict patient privacy requirements inhibit them from alerting others to behaviors that could pose a public risk. It's a difficult balance. Sooner rather than later, policy leaders need to explore a way to provide greater flexibility in patient privacy regulations to enable health care providers to identify seriously ill persons who could potentially pose a harm to innocent people. At the same time, we must reassure those who forthrightly reveal their struggles with mental illness that they can still carry on their lives in ways that will be valuable to their communities, families and employers. That can start with urging employers not to dismiss anyone who discloses his or her mental illness and to retrain them for other appropriate positions. If companies ban them from the workforce or from other roles in society, we will just be shifting the problem elsewhere and perpetuating the stigma that dangerously drives them underground. We won't pretend that this is an easy problem to solve. But, awful as Germanwings Flight 9525 tragedy was, the case may galvanize a discussion and reexamination that is long overdue. We need to build awareness and support for those who suffer from mental illness.","Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot who crashed the Germanwings flight, battled with depression .

"(CNN)He wouldn't give his name. But the name tattooed on his neck -- Gertrude -- gave him away. That's what Kankakee County, Illinois, Sheriff Tim Bukowski said Saturday about Kamron Taylor, the 23-year-old convicted murderer turned jail escapee until his arrest overnight in Chicago. Authorities around Illinois had been looking for Taylor since early Wednesday, when he jumped a correctional officer at Kankakee's Jerome Combs Detention Center, then took off with the guard's uniform and SUV. Surveillance video was the last officials saw of Taylor until just before midnight Friday, in Chicago. ""They saw a guy that matched the description,"" Bukowski said. ""And if you're in law enforcement very long, you just get a feeling that something's not right. ... I think that's what happened."" The suspect ran five city blocks before being tracked down, carrying a loaded handgun. He didn't go easily, refusing to identify himself. But when Chicago police contacted their law enforcement counterparts about 60 miles south in Kankakee County and told them about the tattoo, it became clearer who the man was. As Bukowski said of the Gertrude tattoo, ""It's not a common name to have around your neck."" Fingerprints later confirmed that Chicago police had indeed caught up with Taylor. While not offering details beyond that no one is thought to have driven him north nor did a tipster call to specify his location, Bukowski did say ""we have some ideas of where he went and how he ended up"" in the Windy City. It wasn't immediately known either when Taylor will return to Kankakee County. But, when he does, the sheriff said the convict will likely face an attempted murder charge for his attack of the jail guard on top of his already extensive criminal history. Murderer overpowers guard, drives off in his SUV . Bukowski said he expects that Taylor will eventually be incarcerated outside Kankakee County, in part because ""you don't want someone to raise"" the idea that guards there might somehow seek retaliation for the attack on one of their own. What the sheriff doesn't want is for Taylor to go free ever again. This is a man, after all, who killed a man in a June 2013 botched robbery, had to be wrestled to the ground by bailiffs after his conviction in late February, then escaped jail after assaulting the guard. ""He's not going to walk down the block again, I don't believe,"" Bukowski said. The assaulted correctional officer remains in an Illinois hospital, where his condition has improved and he's been able to talk to fellow authorities. This qualifies as very good news, given that authorities think Taylor ""believed that he had killed that correctional officer by strangling him"" around 3 a.m. (4 a.m. ET) Wednesday, according to the sheriff. The guard was making his rounds when he was attacked from the side, then severely beaten and choked. Taylor then allegedly disrobed the guard, a military veteran and 10-year employee of the corrections department. The guard was left on the jail floor, going in and out of consciousness, for about 35 minutes before authorities -- concerned because the guard hadn't responded to calls -- found him, the sheriff said. The alleged attacker then walked out of the jail, albeit only after having his identity checked by camera after pushing a button to notify ""master control"" that he wanted to leave. ""We think that because he had the officer's uniform on,"" the sheriff explained this week, ""that's how he was able to effectively escape."" Now that Taylor is once again locked up, the focus has shifted more to how he left in the first place. Opining that the escape wouldn't have occurred ""if everybody had followed protocol,"" Bukowski said it's believed the inmate wasn't in his cell at lockdown. ""That's where the big mistake happened,"" the sheriff said. ""Someone missed that. And from that point on, things broke down."" CNN's John Newsome contributed to this report.","The sheriff says a ""big mistake"" contributed to the inmate's escape .

"(CNN)As his military career winds down, Britain's Prince Harry is going to be spending some time down under. The 30-year-old prince is due to arrive Monday in Australia for a four-week stint with the armed forces there. Harry ""will work and live alongside colleagues in the Australian Army in a number of regiments in Sydney, Darwin and Perth,"" the Australian Defence Forces said Thursday. He has already spent time with Australian troops on a number of occasions during his 10-year military career, a spokesman said. ""Prince Harry has trained and served alongside Australian armed forces on operational tours to Afghanistan; he has met them during the Invictus Games; and even trekked to the South Pole with a couple of Australian soldiers,"" the spokesman said. The younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Harry is known in the British Army as ""Captain Harry Wales,"" from his official title and name, His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales. He began his formal military duties in 2005 at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Last month, he announced that he would be leaving the armed forces in June, describing the decision as ""really tough."" Australian military officials say the prince's program with them will be ""challenging."" It will involve training in urban settings and patrolling the Australian bush, as well as aviation activities and fire exercises. He'll also participate in regular activities like physical training and pack marches, the Australian military said. Harry will also spend time meeting wounded, injured and ill service members in Australia. ""Wounded warriors"" are a special interest for Prince Harry. He helped spearhead and continues to champion the Invictus Games, a competition for former military personnel who have been wounded in the line of duty. Before he reports for duty Monday, the prince will lay a wreath at the war memorial in the Australian capital, Canberra. During his attachment with the Australian military, Harry will accompany Charles on a trip to Turkey at the end of April for commemorations on the anniversary of the World War I Battle of Gallipoli.

"(CNN)They used to do the guarding at Florida prisons. Now they're the ones behind bars. Two Florida corrections officers and one former officer trainee have been charged in a plot to kill a former inmate who was getting out of prison, the Florida Attorney General's office said Thursday. An FBI informant met the men -- Thomas Jordan Driver, 25; David Elliot Moran, 47; and Charles Thomas Newcomb, 42 -- after infiltrating a branch of the KKK:  the Traditional American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, CNN affiliate WJXT reported. Driver told the informant that he had gotten into a fight with the inmate and that he and Moran wanted him ""six feet under,"" according to court documents. To convince the suspects that the deed had been done, the FBI staged a fake homicide scene with the former inmate and took pictures to show them that he had been killed. ""When the FBI staged this crime scene and these photographs were shown to each of these men, they were happy about it,"" said Statewide Prosecutor Nick Cox. The three men are now facing up to 30 years in jail if convicted on one count each of conspiracy to commit murder. ""We will not tolerate nor will we ever remain silent over the violence of hatred embedded in prejudice in this country,"" Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said.

"Lausanne, Switzerland (CNN)A roller-coaster series of talks wrapped up Thursday in Lausanne as a group of world powers known as the P5+1 reached a framework agreement with Iran over the country's nuclear program. The success of that agreement remains to be seen. The parties have until the end to June to work out the details and put the plan to paper. But the talks this week were, nevertheless, historic, particularly for the otherwise frozen U.S.-Iranian relationship. But that's not to say they were glamorous. In fact, the negotiations this week provided a modern demonstration of diplomacy at its best, but also at its most hectic. Tucked amid the Swiss Alps on the shores of Lake Geneva, Lausanne is certainly one of the more scenic places to be trapped for talks -- a sort of Camp David for the rich and famous. But make no mistake: The site of these negotiations is also a gilded cage. Over the course of the eight-day round of talks, negotiators, their delegations, their security details and reporters were confined primarily to the immediate area around the five-star Beau-Rivage Palace Hotel, which played host to the negotiations. This isn't the first time the hotel has provided a backdrop to a major diplomatic event. In 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed there, breaking up the Ottoman Empire and defining the borders of modern-day Turkey. More recently, the hotel has been a getaway for wealthy tourists and the occasional celebrity. Coco Chanel famously lived there in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and even had her dog buried on the hotel grounds, some reports say. 'It was tough, very intense at times' The setting is idyllic, and the grounds are beautifully maintained. The first-floor terrace even features a large-scale chess board, which served this week as an artful analogy for the game of nuclear chess going on just inside. For the negotiators, the past week was marked by a marathon run of meetings, sometimes lasting throughout the night. In an interview with CNN shortly after the framework agreement was announced, Secretary of State John Kerry said, ""I think there was a seriousness of purpose"" in meetings with the Iranians. ""People negotiated hard,"" he added. ""It was tough, very intense at times, sometimes emotional and confrontational."" That sentiment was echoed by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif even as the talks were still going on. Over the past 18 months since talks began, Zarif said, negotiators have ""developed personal respect"" for one another, even though serious mistrust still exists between Iran and the Western powers. ""We have a very serious problem of confidence -- mutual lack of confidence we need to address -- and we hope that this process will remedy some of that,"" he added. Media give-and-take . Zarif made these comments to reporters who swarmed him during an afternoon walk along the lake Thursday. Such ambushes were a frequent occurrence during the talks as reporters tried to supplement what little information was being circulated through official channels. Kerry was seen riding a bike on at least one occasion and dining at a nearby crepery on another, with both occasions prompting a cacophony of camera flashes. Reporters briefly followed Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi as he took a morning jog shortly after his arrival in Lausanne on Sunday. And Zarif took several lakeside walks with advisers and security personnel, perhaps just hoping to take in the view, but certainly not making any effort to bypass the area where television cameras were staked out around the clock. The officials sometimes bemoaned the media circus, but they also used the attention to bolster their demands during negotiations, making statements to reporters that they hoped strengthened their footing in talks with their foreign counterparts. ""People often use you guys to deliver messages to the negotiation,"" a senior administration official who asked not to be named told reporters on the flight back to Lausanne, ""as do the Iranians."" ""I think they're quite skilled, actually, at using the media to deliver messages and to try to shape the frame of the negotiation,"" the official said. Different orbits . More than 600 reporters were credentialed to cover the talks this week. Many of these were based in a large workspace at the nearby Olympic Museum. Meanwhile, the traveling press corps covering the foreign ministers were given coveted red badges, allowing them access to the hotel, where the talks took place. While these journalists had a bit more access to officials, they were usually cordoned off inside a couple of claustrophobic media rooms and barred access to most of the building, including the hotel's reception desk, the first-floor restrooms and the two-Michelin-star restaurant's entrees, costing 200 francs or more. Many journalists found refuge in the more comfortable downstairs bar, a shorter walk from the cameras and satellite trucks used around the clock by television reporters on a rolling deadline. For meals, the crowd dispersed to a dozen or so nearby restaurants, where they could enjoy 25-franc pizzas and 60-franc hamburgers, washed down with 8-franc bottles of water, of course. Also popular: a Thai place around the corner that offered quick takeout -- a plus for reporters on a deadline. 'We'd all take deep breaths and try again' In the closed-off wings of the Beau-Rivage, the pace of meetings was frantic as different subsets of delegates gathered in ornate conference rooms. There was a sense of urgency, both before and after the initial March 31 deadline passed, to reach a final understanding so the foreign ministers could leave Switzerland ahead of other time commitments, not to mention the Easter holiday. The process was further complicated by restrictions on the flight crew for Kerry's plane, which could stay on standby at the airport for only a limited number of hours in a given time period. ""We'd get close, we kept on changing the plane schedule,"" a senior administration official told reporters. ""It would go, it wouldn't go; we had to reset the clock."" On the evening the understanding was finally announced, the window had already lapsed, requiring Kerry and his team to depart at 3 a.m. Friday. There were ""many moments (throughout the negotiations) when we thought we'd call it a day, call it a night, decide we'd gone as far as we could go,"" said the official, who briefed reporters on Kerry's plane. ""Then we'd all take deep breaths and try again."" But perhaps the most difficult night for negotiators was between Wednesday and Thursday, just before the final sticking points were resolved for a deal. ""It was a very, very intense,"" said the official. ""It went from 9 -- about 9 in the evening until 6 in the morning when we all decided we'd reached a couple of roadblocks, didn't know whether we'd be able to get past them, and we were all utterly, utterly exhausted."" ""So we all went to sleep by maybe 7, got up again and started again about 9:30, and engaged on what we thought were the really final issues,"" the official added. Rushing to report the agreement . That morning, the deal began to solidify, and plans for the announcement were set into motion. The announcement that an agreement had been reached sparked some chaos. It was first sent out by the European delegation, which spread the word to its traveling press corps even as negotiators were still meeting. As news began to get out, one European reporter ran frantically into the media area at the hotel, urging everyone to listen. His message: There's going to be an announcement. There are buses waiting to take you to the auditorium of a nearby university where it will take place. And with that, the room devolved into chaos as journalists ran for the doors. The eight-day-long diplomatic event had hit its crescendo before finally subsiding. By midday Friday, the delegations had left Lausanne, along with most of the media, returning the scenic Swiss city to its more tranquil pace.","This week's talks on an Iranian nuclear deal framework are historic .

"(CNN)An improvised bomb exploded near a U.N. vehicle traveling near the northeastern Somali city of Garowe on Monday morning, killing six people -- including four aid workers for the international children's agency UNICEF. Somalia's President called it ""an attack against the future of our country."" The attack follows a separate incident Sunday in which three African Union troops died in an ambush in the Lower Shabelle region of Somalia. The terrorist group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for Monday's attack, which occurred about 8 a.m. in the administrative capital of the autonomous Puntland region, according to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia. Four of the victims were foreigners and two were Somalis, said Ahmed Abdullahi Samatar, the police chief of Puntland. UNICEF, the U.N. aid agency focused on children, said it employed four of the dead. Four other workers were in serious condition, the agency said. The bomb went off as a vehicle was taking workers from their guest house to their office. The local police chief said the bomber was inside the vehicle among the U.N. staff. The bomber also died in the attack, according to authorities. Nick Kay, the special representative of the U.N. secretary-general for Somalia, condemned the attack on his Twitter account. ""Shocked and appalled by loss of life,"" he said. Somalia's President, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, said he was horrified by the attack. ""This attack is not just targeted at the United Nations, but in attacking UNICEF, Al-Shabaab has also attacked Somali children. It is an attack against the future of our country and I condemn it in the strongest possible terms,"" he said. UNICEF called the slain workers ""an integral part of UNICEF's work in Somalia, dedicated to improving the lives of others."" Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group based in Somalia, caused outrage this month by carrying out an attack on a Kenyan university. Nearly 150 people, most of them students, died in that attack. In the Sunday incident, three African Union troops were ambushed in the Lower Shabelle region. The African Union Commission for Somalia, or AMISOM, said Sunday that the troops died during a ""spirited fight"" with attackers. ""This attack on AMISOM peacekeepers is part of the continuous effort to subvert Somalia. It is an attempt at disrupting the growth that is evident across all regions, by the enemies of the Somali people. The blood of our brothers will however not be shed in vain. AMISOM will remain committed to pacifying Somalia,"" said AMISOM Ambassador Maman S. Sidikou.

"(CNN)Australia, an important ally of the United States, has agreed to share some of its intelligence with Iran. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the deal is ""an informal arrangement"" with an emphasis on tracking Australians who go to Iraq to fight for ISIS. But one Australian lawmaker reportedly described the move as ""dancing with the devil."" Over the weekend, Bishop became the first Australian government minister to visit Iran in 12 years, meeting with President Hassan Rouhani. The intelligence-sharing deal was announced in an interview released Monday that Bishop gave to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation while in Tehran. ""During my discussions with the national leadership here, it was agreed that we could share intelligence, particularly on the foreign terrorist fighters from Australia who are taking part in this conflict in Iraq,"" she said. The Iranians ""were very agreeable to share that information with us,"" she added. Like many Western nations, Australia is grappling with the problem of citizens who are choosing to travel to Iraq and Syria to join ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. Australia is part of the U.S.-led coalition that's carrying out airstrikes against ISIS. During the fight against the Sunni extremist group, the coalition has found its interests aligned at times with those of Iran, a Shiite-majority nation that has strong ties with the Iraqi government. Iran-backed Shiite militias played an important role in the recent battle to take the Iraqi city of Tikrit from ISIS jihadists. ""Iran has a long standing relationship with Iraq, and as you point out, they have a very strong military presence there. They also have an influence over the Shia militia who are operating within Iraq,"" she said. ""So they are in Iraq, in places that we are not. They also have a very sophisticated intelligence network and they have a lot of information that they've been gathering."" Bishop, who left  Tehran on Sunday, declined to give details of the agreement with Iran. ""Obviously, if Iran has information that will be of interest to us, and if we have information that would be of interest to them, in pursuing our common purpose in defeating Daesh, then that's an appropriate exchange,"" she said, using an alternative name for ISIS. But Andrew Wilkie, an independent Australian member of parliament, criticized the plan. ""The announcement by the Foreign Minister that Australia is entering into a security arrangement with the regime in Tehran really should send shudders down the spine of every Australian,"" he said, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""When you start dancing with the devil in a place like Tehran, then we run the risk of becoming almost as bad as those who we dance with,"" Wilkie told reporters.","Australian foreign minister says deal is to focus on tracking citizens who join ISIS .

"Marseille, France (CNN)Initial tests on the flight data recorder recovered from downed Germanwings Flight 9525 show that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz purposely used the controls to speed up the plane's descent, according to the French air accident investigation agency, the BEA. The flight data recorder, or ""black box,"" was found Thursday by recovery teams that have spent days since the March 24 crash scouring the mountainside in the French Alps where the plane went down. A statement from the BEA on Friday said its teams had immediately begun to investigate its contents. ""The initial readout shows that the pilot present in the cockpit used the autopilot to put the (airplane) into a descent towards an altitude of 100 (feet) then, on several occasions during the descent, the pilot modified the autopilot setting to increase the speed of the (airplane) in descent,"" it said. ""Work is continuing to establish the precise history of the flight."" Evidence from the plane's cockpit voice recorder, recovered swiftly after the crash, had already led investigators to believe that Lubitz acted deliberately to bring down the plane, killing all 150 people on board. And prosecutors in Germany said Thursday that an analysis of a tablet device retrieved from the 27-year-old's apartment in Dusseldorf revealed that he had researched suicide methods and cockpit door security on the Internet. The correspondence and search history on the device demonstrated that the co-pilot used it from March 16 to March 23, Dusseldorf prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said. The search history was not deleted and also revealed searches concerning medical treatment, the prosecutor said. Investigators have focused on Lubitz's health as they try to establish his motivation. But the missing ""black box"" was expected to yield important evidence about the plane's final minutes. A female police officer digging by hand for clothes in a ravine that been searched previously found the flight data recorder Thursday afternoon about 8 inches (20 centimeters) below the surface, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told reporters. Usually white with florescent orange, this discovered recorder lived up to its name as a black box because fire had darkened it with ashes. In addition, out of more than 2,000 DNA samples collected from the crash site, lab workers have isolated 150 DNA profiles, Robin told reporters. ""That does not mean we've identified"" the crash's 150 victims, Robin said -- noting the recovered DNA still must be compared with DNA submitted by the families of those who died in the crash. Authorities have also found 470 personal effects at the site, according to Robin. That number includes 40 cell phones, though all those were badly damaged. Robin cast doubt that any useful information could be retrieved from those phones, given their condition. That view is consistent with French officials' claims Wednesday insisting that two publications, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, were wrong to report that cell phone video showed the harrowing final seconds from on board the flight. Noting he's made a criminal request to German authorities but is for now conducting his own investigation, the French prosecutor said he is tasked with an involuntary homicide investigation. But Robin noted that Lubitz made voluntary actions -- such as guiding the plane toward the mountain and reducing its speed to prevent alarms from going off -- and was ""alive and conscious"" to the very end. A European official government official with detailed knowledge of the investigation said that Lubitz's actions amount to ""premeditated murder."" While cautioning that there are still many holes in understanding Lubitz's motivation, the disclosures about his Internet searches show that he planned to do what he was going to do, according to this official. Calls for crash avoidance technology . It is becoming increasingly clear to investigators that Lubitz was ""very afraid"" he would lose his license to fly because of his medical issues, a law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Thursday. It's already emerged that Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Flight 9525 and that he had concealed from his employer recent medical leave notes saying he was unfit for work. But the law enforcement source said that after a severe depressive episode in 2009, Lubitz relapsed with severe depression and stress in late 2014. In the weeks leading up to the crash, Lubitz was shopping doctors, seeing at least five, perhaps as many as six, the source said, as he kept going from one doctor to the next seeking help, including from a sleep specialist. He was prescribed powerful medication, though it's not clear he was taking it. Opinion: What if my patient is a pilot? CNN's Margot Haddad reported from Marseille, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

"(CNN)A 110-day cat-and-mouse chase spanning from Antarctic waters to the coast of west Africa had an unlikely end when the crew of an alleged poaching vessel were rescued by conservationists pursuing them. Environmentalist group Sea Shepherd had been tailing the Thunder -- subject of an Interpol ""purple notice"" for suspected fraud and fisheries-related crimes -- since its ship the Bob Barker encountered it in the Southern Ocean several months ago. The pursuit ended early Monday in the Gulf of Guinea, off the coast of west Africa, when the Bob Barker received a distress call from the Thunder. ""We were literally a few hundred meters away; they said the ship was sinking and they were abandoning the Thunder,"" said Sea Shepherd spokesman Adam Burling. ""We invited the crew -- 40 of them -- on board, had a medical officer check them over, provided them with food and water."" Bob Barker Captain Peter Hammarstedt said the crew rescued from the ship had been handed over to the Sao Tome coastguard early Tuesday. He said he hoped the authorities would work with Interpol to prosecute those operating the vessel. ""We obviously want to see the captain of the Thunder prosecuted for his offenses,"" he told CNN by phone from the Bob Barker, at sea to the west of Sao Tome. Hammarstedt said he believed the Thunder was deliberately sunk to destroy physical evidence of illegal fishing. ""I'm 100% confident that the captain of the Thunder destroyed his own ship,"" he said. Hammarstedt said he had managed to send three crew members aboard the abandoned Thunder before it went down. ""Usually what happens when a vessel is sinking is the master will ensure all compartments and hatches are shut so as to maintain buoyancy,"" he said. ""On the Thunder, all the hatches had been opened, including the hatch leading to the fish hold."" He said his crew had retrieved computers, mobile phones and other devices from the Thunder that would be handed over to assist any investigation. They had also retrieved a fish from the ship's fish hold, which he said was about a quarter full. He said the fish was a toothfish, the prized stock his organization claims the Thunder was illegally catching when they were encountered in the Southern Ocean. More surprising was the reaction of the captain of the Thunder as his ship went under, he claimed. ""When the vessel went completely under the water, the captain of the Thunder, who was in a life raft at the time, started cheering and applauding, which was very unusual behavior for a skipper who had just lost his ship,"" he said. The pursuit of the Thunder began after the Bob Barker encountered the vessel off the coast of Antarctica, said Burling. He claimed the vessel was found with its nets in the water, illegally catching Patagonian toothfish. The Thunder dropped its nets and left the scene; a second Sea Shepherd vessel that was brought in to retrieve the net found about $3 million of toothfish catch in about 72km of illegal gillnet, he claimed. ""That's why they're out there in these shadowlands, these unpatrolled remote regions,"" he said. Meanwhile the Bob Barker, supported by a second Sea Shepherd vessel, pursued the Thunder all the way to the Gulf of Guinea. During that time, Burling claimed, the Bob Barker narrowly avoided being rammed by the fishing vessel, while its smaller boats were struck with grappling hooks. The rescue had gone smoothly despite the months of tensions between the two vessels, said Burling. ""We worried what they might be like to our crew, whether they might be hostile or violent to us,"" he said. But the Indonesian crew who made up the majority of those on board the Thunder seemed ""very relieved"" to be rescued. The officers -- who he believed were Spanish -- were less so. ""Perhaps they would have preferred to have been rescued by someone else, but given the location there was really no other option,"" he said. An Interpol ""purple notice,"" released at the request of New Zealand in December 2013, put out a global call for information on the Thunder, as well as information on ""the individuals and networks that own, operate and profit from the illegal actions of the vessel."" It said the vessel had changed its name, national registration and other characteristics a number of times to avoid detection of its illegal fishing activities, and had sailed under the names ""Wuhan N 4"" and ""Kuko,"" and under the flags of Nigeria and Mongolia. The Interpol notice said it had ""conflicting information"" about the identity of the vessel's current operator, but said it had previously been registered as owned by companies in Spain, the Seychelles and Nigeria. Interpol confirmed Tuesday that the purple notice remained in place. It said it had monitored the situation and noted that all the vessel's crew members were safely ashore. ""Interpol does not conduct investigations itself; however, we remain available to support any national law enforcement authorities with jurisdiction in this case if such assistance is requested,"" it told CNN. It said no requests had been received as yet.","Sea Shepherd rescues the crew of an alleged poaching ship it had chased for 110 days .

"(CNN)Most days, 16-year-old Jason Zobott walks into Huntley High School in suburban Chicago around 7:30 a.m. like any high schooler might. It's what he does the rest of the day that's not so typical. Zobott is enrolled in Huntley High's blended learning program, which merges Internet-based instruction with a more traditional classroom setting. One-third of the school's 2,700 students are enrolled. In 2015, the school is working toward enrolling the majority of its students. ""Having to work online makes it really accessible to do the work that I have to get done,"" said Zobott, a top-ranked junior who balances a heavy load of extracurricular activities with schoolwork. ""I can learn on my own. I can work at the pace I want to work. And I learn the way I want to learn."" Huntley High School students and educators often refer to the program simply as ""blended."" It allows teachers to write the curriculum, with students giving feedback about the focus. Unlike many traditional online learning programs, students have the option of a flexible schedule during allotted blended learning days. Some days they meet with teachers, and some days they work online, according to Anne Pasco, who heads the school's educational technology efforts. ""In blended learning, we focus on the content. We don't focus on needing to cover X amount of material,"" Pasco said. ""Blended allows us to provide a stable environment that gives students the ability to spread their wings a bit, while we have the safety net of pulling them back into class if they need it."" The ""homegrown"" program, which launched in 2011, gives students who struggle in certain content areas more one-on-one time with teachers during the school day, Pasco said. ""Before blended, that had to happen after school or before school or on Saturday or maybe not at all, because we had too many other activities that encroach upon (students') academic day,"" Pasco said. ""Now, this student can work one-on-one with that teacher during the school day."" Teachers can monitor students' progress and track lesson plans online to see how much time students spend on a specific assignment. Teachers are allowed to restructure the class schedule based on students' needs. ""There's actually much better accountability,"" said John Burkey, the superintendent for Huntley High's school district, which includes about 9,500 students. ""Blended learning is not a panacea, and the success of the program isn't about spending a bunch of money on technology. Rather, [it's] looking at what students actually need, and building a culture of innovation to meet those needs."" Burkey said there were plenty of questions about blended learning when it was first introduced to the Chicago district in 2011. One concern: How was the district going to pay for it? It turns out the blended learning program spends about $8,500 per student, less than the Illinois average of  $12,000 per student. ""We spend considerably less than the average school district. We don't have a lot of resources compared to many districts,"" Burkey said. ""We did not put new money into this. What we did is change the old things we were doing and changed them into new ways. It's really a change in how you think of high school. This is not a more expensive option."" It has worked. In a study published in 2014 in eLearn magazine, 92% of students surveyed at Huntley High said that they were satisfied with the blended learning experience, and no teachers reported negative experiences with it. The school is also seeing higher standardized testing scores. ""The growth of blended certainly has corresponded with an overall rise in ACT scores,"" district spokesman Dan Armstrong said. Since blended learning was implemented, Huntley High's average composite ACT score has gone up nearly a point, from 22.1 to 23.0. For 16-year-old Zobott, the advantage is time management. Three of his courses are advanced placement. He also plays varsity basketball and club soccer and works part time. The blended learning program helps him better prioritize his busy schedule. ""Having blended gives us time to work on them, and get stuff done efficiently so we have more time during the week to do other things,"" he said. What's still left to be determined about blended learning is how well students do in college or jobs after they graduate, Burkey said. ""I think we're still in the infancy of this,"" Burkey said. ""It's still such a new thing, and we're all excited about it. My own kids are still in elementary and middle school, so they have not done blended learning yet, but they definitely will when they get to high school.""","Huntley High School in Huntley, Illinois, offers a blended learning program .

"Garissa, Kenya (CNN)Days after a horrific Al-Shabaab attack on its soil, Kenya launched airstrikes targeting the terror group in Somalia, according to a military source, who insisted the strikes were not retribution for last week's massacre at Garissa University College that killed nearly 150 people. ""The latest attack of Al-Shabaab bases by the Kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011. It is not a retaliation to the Garissa attack. The operation has been ongoing,"" the military source said Monday. It is customary for Kenyan military sources not to give their names to media. Two of the airstrikes hit Al-Shabaab training camps, according to a resident of the southwest Somalian town of Bardera, almost 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Kenyan border, and a local journalist who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety. The Kenyan military began its bombing raids Sunday afternoon, targeting the Al-Shabaab stronghold of Godon Dhawe, Somali resident Ibrahim Mohammed said. Godon Dhawe is between Bardera and the Somalia-Kenya border. Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, has claimed responsibility for the university attack. Also Monday, a police source said Kenyan authorities had intelligence beforehand that a university in Garissa could be attacked, yet the country's rapid response team was stuck in Nairobi for hours after the massacre began, arranging for transport. It's not clear exactly why the elite team was stuck in the Kenyan capital, roughly 370 kilometers (230 miles) west of the attack, but the police source in Garissa told CNN that Kenyan politicians and Nairobi-based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did. Journalists on the ground corroborated that report. Once the team entered the university complex, the situation was quickly defused, journalists and the police source said. Manoah Esipisu, a spokesman for Kenya's president and deputy president, defended the response time, telling CNN there is always criticism regarding whether ""you reacted as fast as you have or shouldn't have."" ""With the benefit of hindsight you can always say things could have been done better,"" he said, adding that Kenyan authorities saved a lot of students and ""got the job done."" Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed echoed those remarks in a Monday interview with CNN, saying the response was sufficient and denying reports that it was the elite rapid response team alone that brought an end to the situation. ""We have a military garrison in Garissa, and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists. So the response was adequate,"" she said. She repeated Esipisu's assertion that dubbing the response slow is a reaction that comes only with the luxury of hindsight. ""Obviously when parents are grieving and the country is mourning, it's always easy to fall back on things like that, but I can assure you that we took very quick action as soon as this was reported,"" Mohamed said. ""Obviously hindsight is always 20/20. We did everything that we could do."" The Kenyan government says Mohamed Mohamud is the mastermind of Thursday's terrorist attack on Garissa University College. The country's Interior Ministry singled out Mohamud, a senior leader of Al-Shabaab, on Twitter. He is also known by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, it said. Mohamud is ""credited with having an extensive terrorist network within Kenya,"" according to a Kenyan ministry document given to CNN. The ministry posted a ""most wanted"" notice for Mohamud. It offers a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, about $215,000. ""We appeal to anyone with any info on #Gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies,"" the Interior Ministry posted on Twitter. Mohamud is in charge of external operations against Kenya, the document says, and he is the regional commander within Al-Shabaab in charge of the Juba region. In this role, he commands the militia along the border and ""is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country."" His position as one of Al-Shabaab's top field commanders in southern Somalia has brought him into direct conflict with Kenyan troops deployed as part of African Union forces in the country. ""This is a man who has a lot of grudges against the Kenyans,"" said Stig Jarle Hansen, an associate professor at Oslo's Norwegian University of Life Sciences and author of ""Al-Shabaab in Somalia: The History and Ideology of a Militant Islamist Group."" Mohamud's network extends within the Dadaab refugee camp, the document says. Dadaab is the world's biggest refugee camp, home to thousands of people, according to the United Nations. It's in Kenya's North Eastern Province near Somalia. Garissa, the town where the university attack took place, is about 150 kilometers (90 miles) from the Somali border. It's within ""striking distance"" of Mohamud's stronghold in Somalia's Middle Juba province, Hansen told CNN. But he noted that Mohamud is better known ""for tactical military attacks rather than terrorist attacks."" Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter . Over the weekend, Al-Shabaab promised to bring about ""another bloodbath"" in Kenya. Though the terrorist group is based in Somalia, it hasn't confined its violence to the lawless nation. In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years, including December's attack on a quarry in a Kenyan village near the Somali border, which killed at least 36 people. In that attack, Al-Shabaab militants separated non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and killed them. Mohamud is Kenyan and has three wives and three siblings, including two with links to Al-Shabaab, the document says. He's from a clan, the Ogaden, that has a heavy presence in Kenya and Somalia, Hansen said. ""The borders historically have been meaningless to them,"" he said. CNN exclusive: Exposing smuggler routes across the Somalia-Kenya border . On Sunday, Kenya's Interior Ministry identified another terrorist involved in the Garissa University College attack as Abdirahim Abdullahi. Abdullahi's father, Abdullahi Daqare, a government chief in Mandera in northern Kenya, told CNN that his son was missing. Daqare is a Kenyan Somali, he said. His son graduated in 2013 from Nairobi University law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing, Daqare said in a phone interview. ""I have received reports from people who found information (on) the Internet that my son was one of the terrorists,"" Daqare said. ""I previously told the government that the son is missing. I sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son."" He added that the two had not been in contact since his son disappeared. Daqare said he had ""really given up on him."" On Sunday, families of some of the more than 147 people slain at Garissa University College left a mortuary in Nairobi after identifying the bodies of their loved ones. One woman almost had to be carried out. ""Why? Why? Where are you, my children?"" she wailed. Across Garissa, there was a sense of fear, foreboding and grief. The news agency Reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter's hand at a church as military patrols and security officials searched people. A church member told the agency, ""Nowhere is safe, but here in church you can come, you be with God and then you just console yourself."" Three days of national mourning for victims of the attack, declared by Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, began Sunday. CNN's Christian Purefoy and Lilian Leposo reported from Garissa; Eliott C.

"(CNN)Duke University students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting ""We are not afraid. We stand together,""  after a noose was found hanging from a tree on campus. Duke officials have asked anyone with information about the rope noose, which was found near a student center at 2 a.m., to call campus police. Photos of the noose prompted outrage from the community as they were passed along on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was hung, hundreds of people gathered. ""You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' "" Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a ""cowardly act."" ""To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,"" Larry Moneta said. Duke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham, North Carolina.","The noose, made of rope, was discovered on campus about 2 a.m.

"(CNN)A U.S. citizen with alleged ties to al Qaeda did not enter a plea during his initial court appearance Thursday on charges of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. Muhanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, 29, was deported from Pakistan to the United States. He's accused of plotting to fight against American forces abroad, according to a complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. ""This is news for celebration,"" said CNN counterterrorism analyst Philip Mudd. ""Pretty simple reason why: If you look at a case like this, I think most Americans would say the significance of this case is that this guy, an American, is going to come back home and conduct an attack. Instead, you should look at him as a ... facilitator. ""He's not going to burn himself by coming back. He's going to serve as the conduit or known in Pakistan who understands the West, how you travel, how you stay out of the clutches of law enforcement and he also understands al Qaeda in Pakistan. Those people are really hard to come by. This is a great catch not because he was a potential bomber but because he could have trained tens of bombers."" Farekh's court appearance comes on the same day that federal prosecutors announced the arrests of two New York women accused of planning to build an explosive device for an attack on U.S. soil. The women, identified as Noelle Velentzas, 28, and Asia Siddiqui, 31, were arrested in a plot inspired by the terrorist group ISIS and others to build a weapon of mass destruction, according to a criminal complaint. They are both U.S. citizens and were roommates in the borough of Queens. Farekh allegedly departed from Canada and headed to Pakistan with two other men in 2007 with the intention of fighting American forces abroad, prosecutors said. In the past 18 months, the Justice Department's National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting more than 30 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups. Of those cases, 18 allegedly involve support to ISIS. ""Given how the terrorist threat to the world is evolving, how the potential terrorist threat to our nation is evolving, homeland security is becoming a matter of 'hometown security,' "" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters Thursday. ""The terrorist threat is more decentralized, more diffuse, more complicated. It involves the potential lone wolf actor, it involves the effective use of social media, the Internet."" A Texas native, Farekh and his co-conspirators allegedly conspired to provide material support and resources to al Qaeda from 2006 to 2009, according to the complaint. Their intention, according to court documents: To kill and attempt to kill U.S. government employees and military personnel abroad. ""Al Farekh allegedly provided material support to terrorists with every intention of becoming a martyr,"" FBI Assistant Director in Charge Diego Rodriguez said in a statement. ""Today, members of our military are safer."" When Farekh, another man named Ferid Imam and a third co-conspirator left Canada for Pakistan in 2007, they did not inform their families of their plans, court documents said. The three men were enrolled as students at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. Prosecutors said they called a friend in Canada after arriving in Pakistan to say that they would not be heard from again because they were becoming martyrs. In September 2008, Imam allegedly provided weapons and other military training at an al Qaeda camp in Pakistan to three men -- Najibullah Zazi, Zarein Ahmedzay and Adis Medunjanin. The trio had planned to return to the United States to carry out a suicide attack on the New York subway, according to prosecutors. Zazi and Ahmedzay have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with prosecutors. They have not been sentenced. Medunjanin was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Imam has been indicted for his role in the plot. If convicted, Farekh faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. His next court date is May 2.","Muhanad Mahmoud Al Farekh was deported from Pakistan to the United States .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)A border guard was killed in a cross-boundary fire exchange with militants in Yemen this week, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported Thursday -- marking Saudi Arabia's first publicly known military death since it launched airstrikes against rebels inside its southern neighbor. The clash occurred Wednesday night at the border in southwestern Saudi Arabia's Asir region, when militants in a mountainous area on the Yemeni side fired on Saudi border troops, prompting them to return fire, SPA reported. Besides the slain border guard -- identified as Cpl. Salman Ali Yahya al-Maliki -- 10 others suffered injuries that were not life-threatening, the Saudi media outlet said. On Thursday, Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace in the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, a neutral security official and two Houthi commanders in Aden told CNN. The palace had been where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, who fled the country last month, had stayed for a period of time after Houthis secured control of the capital, Sanaa, in January. According to the security official, Houthis now control most large districts in Aden amid ongoing clashes. Yemeni special forces, considered pro-Houthi and loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, arrived in Aden on Thursday in an attempt ""to secure the city,"" a Saudi official with knowledge of the situation told CNN. ""I can now confirm that it is not Saudi special forces who have landed but Yemeni special forces loyal to Saleh who landed by small boat. They are few in number and have made their way to the old parliament building,"" the intelligence official said. U.S. Navy warships, meanwhile, were patrolling off Yemen in search of suspicious shipping in the region, in particular any weapons shipments from Iran to the Houthi rebels they are supporting in Yemen, a U.S. defense official told CNN. The Navy on Wednesday came across a Panamanian-registered cargo ship that had left an Iranian port, the official said. Based on the route of the ship from Iran to Yemen, the Navy declared it a ""vessel of interest"" and requested permission from the captain to search it. The ship was found to be carrying cement and construction materials, the official said. It was sent on its way. The offshore area has been a route for weapons smuggling into Yemen, as well as Sudan and Gaza, so the Navy has maintained a regular surveillance presence there. The official said that increased fighting in the last several days in southern Yemen has resulted in other ships trying to dock to help civilians leave the country. Marie Claire Feghali, an International Committee of the Red Cross spokeswoman in Sanaa, described events in Aden as ""extremely fluid and very, very complicated."" ""Hospitals are still struggling, running out of supplies. So are we,"" she said. ""We cannot move much in Aden due to the intense fighting and chaos."" A hospital near heavy fighting was forced to shut down. Officials: Al Qaeda fighters free 270 from Yemeni prisons .

"Dubai (CNN)It's with some trepidation that I set off for the Al Marmoum camel race in Dubai. As the only Gulf national in the CNN team, I am expected to be familiar with camel racing, an ancient tradition in the region. But despite my attempts to dress in a kandora, a UAE national dress, my modern outlook on life means I am a total outsider in this world. A cheerful farm owner leads us inside the majlis -- meeting area -- where the camel owners are gathering. The wide space of the majlis feels like an ornate theater. The camel owners are sitting on the floor, eating the a'aish, a traditional Arabic dish of fish and rice, laid out in front of them. The conversation is loud and exciting. We take our place on the floor and slowly, the world of camel racing begins to open up to us. The conversation is all about camels; the best breeds, famous old champions, training methods, bad losers and potential winners. Over Arabic coffee and dates I am told that remote controlled robots have replaced children as camel jockeys -- this primal sport is moving with the times. Once lunch is over, we head to the track for the racing to begin. There will be 14 races through the afternoon. And in addition to the honor and prestige, the camels are racing for thousands of dollars in prize money and fancy new cars for their owners. It's surprising how spectacular camel racing can be. Compared to the grace of thoroughbred racehorses, camels are indeed ungainly creatures. But 20 of these huge beasts pounding around a track in the desert is really a sight to behold, their hooves throwing up a cloud of dust in their wake. Their owners hang out of their four-by-fours, shouting encouragement while trying to keep up with their charges. It is oddly beautiful. The winning camels are paraded with pride, their heads and necks covered in bright golden saffron and their owners applauded for their efforts and rewarded with cash prizes. As we excitedly watch the final race draw to a close, the sun sets across the sky of this metropolis. Camel racing bears no relevance to the modernity embraced here, but this old-fashioned sport is equally as fascinating.","Camel racing is a centuries-old tradition in the Gulf .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN)Charlie Hill sits in a dark bar on a blindingly sunny Havana day. ""Hey man,"" he says with a smoker's rasp and a nod that indicates he knows you have been looking for him. But then a lot of people have been looking for Charlie Hill for a long time. For 43 years Cuba has provided refuge for Hill from facing charges that he killed a New Mexico police officer and hijacked an airliner to Havana. Hill, now 65, decided to give CNN an interview after we'd spent two years trying to reach him. He wants to discuss how for the first time he is considering leaving his safe haven and returning to the United States. Before talking more, Hill finishes his plastic glass of beer and takes a final draw on his stub of a cigarette. We step out into the sunlight and go to a park where Hill starts to give his reasons why he may soon end his long run from the law. ""I miss my country,"" he said, his voice cracking. ""I miss my family. I would like to go back and see where my grandparents were born, where I was born, where I went to junior high. Eat some blackberry pie. Even go to McDonald's. That's only natural."" Hill was a black power militant and said he is still a revolutionary. But he craves the kind of French fries that only capitalism can make. After five decades of Cold War-era mistrust, the United States and Cuba are working to re-establish full diplomatic ties, but cases like Hill's present an obstacle to an improved relationship. New Mexico, where Hill's case has been open for decades, followed up on the shift in policy from the Obama administration with Gov. Susana Martinez asking Washington to pursue Hill's extradition. Critics of the new opening to Cuba say Havana's harboring of fugitives like Charlie Hill is enough of a reason to maintain a hard line against the government of Raul Castro and keep Cuba on the State Department list of countries that support terrorism. State Dept. recommends removing Cuba from terrorism list . Hill, now 65, may extradite himself first, saying the warming of relations between the United States and Cuba could mean an end to what he calls his ""exile"" on the communist-run, Caribbean island, even if his return brings jail time. New Mexico Police Chief Pete Kassetas said he welcomed the news of Hill's possible surrender. ""I understand that the social environment was very different in 1971 than it is today. I encourage him to return to face the charges against him on the state level and on the federal level and end his self-imposed exile in Cuba."" Charlie Hill's  journey began on November 8, 1971, when he and two other men -- Michael Finney and Ralph Goodwin --  were pulled over on I-40 outside Albuquerque, New Mexico, in the middle of a cross-country drive. All three men were members of the Republic of New Afrika, a black power militant group that sought to break off Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina into a separate nation for African-Americans. They were on the way from California to the South with a car loaded with weapons to support the cause. New Mexico State Police Officer Robert Rosenbloom pulled over their rented Ford Galaxie sedan, on suspicion that the car was stolen, said Kassetas. At 10:41 p.m., Rosenbloom called in the California license plate of the militants' car, according to the New Mexico Law Enforcement Memorial. Fourteen minutes later the dispatcher radioed Rosenbloom back but was unable to reach him. A police officer arriving at the scene found Rosenbloom's body lying face down on the road, Kassetas said. There was a single bullet wound to his throat. Rosenbloom gripped his flashlight with one hand and his gun with the other, according to the records of the New Mexico Law Enforcement Memorial. The sedan was found the next day abandoned with three military rifles, a 12-gauge shotgun, ""revolutionary literature,"" bomb-making materials and hundreds of rounds of ammunition . Hill copped to riding in the sedan that Rosenbloom pulled over but refused to say who shot the policeman. ""I am not a cop killer. I am a freedom fighter,"" Hill said. ""I am a Vietnam vet and people never ask me if I killed Vietnamese because that was authorized by the American government. I dedicated myself to liberating my people."" For 19 days, Hill said, the men hid out in the New Mexico desert, working on an escape plan as 250 law enforcement officers closed in. ""We had to go into exile so we hijacked a plane,"" Hill said. The three men, Kassetas said, commandeered a tow truck at gunpoint, crashed through a fence onto the runway of Albuquerque International Airport and ran up the gangway to TWA Flight 106. Elizabeth Walthall was a flight attendant aboard the Boeing 727 when the fugitives stormed aboard. ""They were dirty and stunk from hiding out in the hills,"" she told CNN from her home in North Carolina. Walthall, now 72, said Charlie Hill put a blade to her throat. ""He told me to do what he said because 'this is no butter knife.' I told him, 'Well, I am no piece of bread.'"" Hill laughed, she said, and lowered the knife. Hijacker Michael Finney glowered and pointed a pistol at the flight attendants, Walthall said, a tremor of fear audible in her voice, as if the hijacking had just happened. ""Finney said he would shoot us and that he had already killed a man,"" Walthall said. The hijackers ordered the crew to fly to Africa. Informed the plane couldn't fly that far, they changed their destination. Take us to Cuba, they told the pilot. The trio knew Cuba would most likely let them stay. After seizing power in 1959, Fidel Castro blasted Washington for failing to send back the Batista regime officials who streamed to Miami to escape Castro's revolutionary tribunals, effectively ending the extradition agreement between the two countries. A rash of airplane hijackings to the island soon followed. Cuba became popular with leftist revolutionaries as well as common criminals seeking a country beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement. ""If anything went down, you went to Cuba,"" Hill said. En route to Havana, flight attendant Walthall said she served the men bottles of Michelob beer. When they finished, she saved the bottles in airsickness bags so U.S. law enforcement later would have their fingerprints. After landing, Walthall said she last saw Charlie Hill and the other hijackers as Cuban soldiers escorted them off the plane. Years later, the flight attendant said she experienced flashbacks of the hijacking and sometimes prayed for Hill. ""I think he is a lost soul,"" she said. Revolutionary Cuba soon disappointed Hill.  Cuban officials denied his request for military training to fight with revolutionary groups in Africa. Instead he was put to work cutting sugar cane, doing construction and administrating a clothing store. One of the many menial jobs he worked, he said, put him under the supervision of Ramón Castro, Fidel Castro's older brother. ""He has a big beard and looks just like Fidel,"" Hill remembered. ""He was good to us, made sure we were always well fed."" In 1996, then-New Mexico Rep. Bill Richardson traveled to Cuba to discuss Hill's extradition with Fidel Castro. ""I talked to Fidel and he said, 'No way, under no circumstances would he turn them over, that they were legitimate fugitives,"" Richardson told CNN. ""I got a very strong signal not only would I not be allowed to bring back Charlie Hill but I wouldn't even be allowed to talk to him."" Hill is now the last living member of the trio of hijackers. U.S. officials said that Ralph Goodwin drowned in 1973 and Michael Finney succumbed to throat cancer in 2005. Married and divorced twice in Cuba, Hill has two children on the island and he worries about leaving them if he were to return to the United States. But Hill said he wants to visit his daughter, who was 6 years old when he left, and who he hasn't seen since. He dreams of meeting the five grandchildren he has in United States. He's gone as far as hiring a New Mexico attorney, in case he decides to negotiate a surrender. His Cuban government pension is a meager $10 a month, he said. Not nearly enough to support him or even buy toys for his 8-year-old Cuban son. Hill said he became a babalao, or Santeria priest, but still hasn't found peace. He admitted he smokes too many unfiltered Cuban cigarettes and drinks too much cheap rum. And there's always the possibility that the Cuban government has held onto Hill and other U.S. fugitives, simply waiting for the right moment to trade them to the United States. He said he is fine with that fate. ""They took me in,"" he said. ""If the Cuban government feels me going is for the benefit of 12 million people, that's my sacrifice. I don't worry about that."" As the interview ends, Hill lights another cigarette. A group of Americans touring Havana in a 1950's classic car pull up to the park. They have no idea they are feet away from a wanted fugitive, but as Hill would say, that's Cuba. Hill isn't interested in staying in touch. He doesn't have a cell phone. Too poor, he says. He won't say exactly where he lives in Havana. He has to be cautious. And as he walks off, once again, he is gone.

"Washington (CNN)As the Missouri National Guard prepared to deploy to help quell riots in Ferguson, Missouri, that raged sporadically last year, the guard used highly militarized words such as ""enemy forces"" and ""adversaries"" to refer to protesters, according to documents obtained by CNN. The guard came to Ferguson to support law enforcement officers, whom many community leaders and civil rights activists accused of using excessive force and inflaming an already tense situation in protests that flared sporadically from August through the end of the year. The National Guard's language, contained in internal mission briefings obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, is intensifying the concerns of some who objected to the police officers' actions in putting down riots. They broke out after the August 9 shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by city police officer Darren Wilson. A grand jury declined to indict Wilson in the case. ""It's disturbing when you have what amounts to American soldiers viewing American citizens somehow as the enemy,"" said Antonio French, an alderman in St. Louis. The documents obtained by CNN also detail that the Missouri National Guard was concerned about perceptions of its deployment, with superiors later telling troops to stop using heavily militarized language to describe protesters. And the communications show them calibrating the timing of their deployment in November -- in anticipation of the St. Louis County grand jury's decision on whether to indict Wilson -- to try to ensure that their presence didn't further dial up tensions, though several community members voiced concern that they were not deployed quickly enough. ""We are deliberately constraining mobilization timelines to the last couple days to minimize backlash from calling up the NG early,"" Col. David Boyle, Army chief of staff at the Missouri National Guard, informed his officers in a Nov. 18 email. ""We have coordinated for lower profile, less confrontation likely mission sets to emphasize support roles and minimize public militarization perception."" Additionally, some in the National Guard seemed worried the language in the mission briefings could be problematic. Days before the announcement of the grand jury's decision, an email from Boyle warned of potential consequences from using language that could be ""construed as potentially inflammatory."" Two days after that, notification was sent to commanding officers stating that ""all reference of 'enemy' were changed to state 'criminal elements'."" Still, National Guard spokesman Capt. Quinn defended the militarized language as standard for the planning process ahead of deployment. In an email to CNN, he said the documents used in the Ferguson mission briefings were ""a generic military planning format utilized in a wide range of military missions, so the term 'enemy forces' would be better understood as 'potential threats.' Often in Guard operations, threats would include inclement weather, heat, failing levees, etc."" In further comments emailed to CNN late Friday, after the initial version of this article appeared, Quinn insisted that ""while the term 'enemy forces' appears in a handful of early drafts of the operations order it was also clear that as soon as leadership saw the language, they correctly identified it as being inappropriate for this type of mission"" and claimed that the language was changed ""well ahead of the grand jury's decision."" But internal communications from as early as Aug. 14 through Nov. 18, when the directive was issued to change the inflammatory language, show numerous uses of the terms that were sent to a large number of National Guard commanders and leadership. Though the National Guard's actions throughout the fall did not elicit the type of complaints that were directed at the police, some in Ferguson were displeased that the guardsman didn't do more to act against looters and vandals. Ferguson Mayor James Knowles criticized the guard at a November 25 news conference, saying that ""unfortunately, as the unrest grew and further assistance was needed, the National Guard was not deployed in enough time to save all our businesses."" Quinn, in his comments to CNN, responded that it would not have been part of the National Guard's mission to confront those destroying businesses. Rather, the force would have stood guard at sites of unrest while law enforcement officers entered looted businesses and arrested suspects. The documents reveal that the Missouri guard was especially concerned that ""adversaries"" might use phone apps and police scanners to expose operational security. ""Counterintelligence operations are directed at supporting an information campaign. Their audience does not require the information to be accurate and is easily swayed,"" one document read. A document titled ""Operation Show-Me Protection II,"" which outlines the Missouri National Guard's mission in Ferguson, listed players on the ground deemed ""Friendly Forces"" and ""Enemy Forces."" Among groups characterized as hate groups were the KKK, the RgB Black Rebels and the New Black Panther Party, but also ""General Protesters."" The document read: ""Protesters have historically used Molotov cocktails, rocks, and other debris to throw at police. Several small arms fire incidents have occurred. Some elements may utilize militants [sic] tactics taught by USPER RgB Black Rebels."" A communication specifying the types of gear and dangers the soldiers were likely to face warned that, ""rioters likely have constructed home-made protection like goggles, gas masks, and plywood shields. Further, select individuals may have bullet proof vests and may carry firearms."" It further noted that, ""a possible method of attack is the use of Molotov cocktails against personnel and equipment. Also the possibility exists of the use of arson for destruction and disruption of the power grid through targeted attack."" In addition to analyzing the threat general protesters could pose to soldiers, the National Guard also briefed its commanders on their intelligence capabilities so they could ""deny adversaries the ability to identify Missouri National Guard vulnerabilities upon which threat forces may exploit, causing embarrassment, or harm to the MONG,"" the mission set states. ""Adversaries are most likely to possess human intelligence (HUMINT), open source intelligence (OSINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT), technical intelligence (TECHINT), and counterintelligence capabilities,"" states Appendix 3, which outlines Operations Security. But the ways the National Guard lists for how this information can be obtained are nothing more than open records, social media, and listening on conversations being carries out in public by civil authorities or law enforcement. ""Overseas deployments are all about predictability,"" Col. David Boyle of the Missouri National Guard warned in an email on August 25 in the wake of protests just two weeks after the death of Michael Brown. ""DSCA (defense in support of civil authorities) is not, it is all about rapid expansion and contraction to fit quickly shifting support requirements.""

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)Gunmen stormed the headquarters of Somalia's education ministry in the country's capital on Tuesday after a suicide car bombing, a two-pronged attack that killed at least 12 people and injured 16 others, officials said. The Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab is responsible for the attack in the center of Mogadishu, group spokesman Abu Musab said. The attack began when two suicide bombers detonated their car at the entrance of the two-story building housing the Ministry of Education, Culture & Higher Education, Somali National Security Ministry spokesman Mohamed Yusuf said. Five gunmen then entered the building, shooting people inside, Yusuf said. Security guards at the building, and, later, Somali special forces battled the gunmen inside, witnesses said. Soldiers from the African Union, who are in Somalia in part to support the government's fight against Al-Shabaab, teamed up with Somali security forces to shoot and kill the five attackers, Yusuf said. The attack killed four Somali soldiers and eight civilians, according to Yusuf. The special forces helped people out of the building while the attack was underway, city police Capt. Mohamud Abdi said. Ali Hassan, a man who was helped from the building, confirmed that a rescue operation was happening inside. Somalia-based Al-Shabaab has battled the country's government for years, aiming to overthrow it and turn the nation into a fundamentalist Islamic state. In recent years, the group also launched terror attacks beyond Somalia's borders, sometimes targeting non-Muslims. What is Al-Shabaab, and what does it want? Earlier this month, Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Garissa University College in neighboring Kenya, killing 147 people, mostly students. The terrorists separated Christians from Muslims and shot those who couldn't recite verses from the Quran, witnesses said. In Somalia, Al-Shabaab has been blamed for attacks that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers. Late last month, Al-Shabaab militants detonated a bomb and sprayed bullets at a Mogadishu hotel, leaving at least 20 people dead in an attack that lasted a number of hours. Among those killed was Yusuf Mohamed Ismail Bari-Bari, Somalia's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta.","Al-Shabaab claims responsibility for the attack .

"(CNN)One war was enough for Gregory Margolin. Now 87 years old, he was a 16-year-old Jewish recruit when he fought in the Soviet Red Army. As he fought the Nazis in World War II, his family fled. ""I did not show that I was Jewish,"" Margolin says. ""But it did not matter because people were being killed left and right. All around me."" This year, in Ukraine, he found himself again surrounded by war. Margolin was a sniper who rose to be a commander in the army. His old uniform is still adorned with medals from his time in the military. His granddaughter Liora still marvels at his stories from the war. She is amazed that he managed to survive. Suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative condition that impairs memory, he struggles to remember his own life sometimes, but he remembers the horrors of war. His eyes slowly shift back and forth as he seeks the right word. Or perhaps the right memory. His hands shake ever so slightly. It seems he knows he has lived a life. He is just trying to remember all the details. ""People were hiding in shelters under the ground,"" Liora says of the stories Margolin once told. ""They were being shot at point blank range. It was terrible."" ""[The Nazis] would have erased us from the Earth,"" Margolin remembers. ""They attacked us and we fought back."" After the war, Margolin settled in Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine. His family grew. He built a life. Then, decades later, he found himself in the middle of a war once again. ""A missile fell and the house was destroyed. We were attacked,"" Margolin says. ""A missile fell. I remember."" Margolin's family lived in a neighborhood next to the Donetsk airport, near some of the most intense fighting in Eastern Ukraine as pro-Russian separatists battled the Ukrainian army. Margolin, who had survived one war, was able to survive another, even as the stray missile hit his house on February 10. It spared him, but it killed his daughter Ira. ""The moment it happened, we decided that's it. Here and now, we're moving to Israel,"" says Liora. ""This is the safest place."" Margolin arrived in Israel on March 24. Asked why the family waited to leave the war-torn region of Eastern Ukraine, Liora says they felt they would be fine in Donetsk, while Liora prayed for their safety from Israel. ""No matter how much we're afraid of the next war here and as much as it's not quiet here, it is the quietest place."" Margolin came over in a wave of Ukrainian Jewish immigration to Israel that coincided with the beginning of hostilities in Eastern Ukraine. The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, an organization that works to build interfaith understanding and support for Israel, has brought 600 Jews to Israel since December, Margolin among them. Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, the fellowship's founder, says, ""We set up a refugee center. It's the first time since the Holocaust that the Jewish world has had to set up a refugee center for these Jews who are fleeing and have nowhere to go."" Among the Ukrainian Jews moving to Israel, Eckstein says they have worked with approximately a dozen Holocaust survivors. On Yom HaShoah, Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day that commemorates the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews, these stories of survival reverberate with a renewed energy. Jews who struggled to survive once find themselves fleeing to survive now. ""Most of the [Jewish] people in the Ukraine are Holocaust survivors or children of Holocaust survivors. These are the people who made it, who are able to flee or come back or to stay or to somehow survive the Holocaust."" Margolin was one of these people, able to survive the Holocaust as a soldier in the Soviet Army. His story can be difficult for him to remember sometimes, but it is impossible for his family to forget.

"(CNN)How can more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls simply disappear? And how can the Nigerian government and the rest of the world have allowed this to happen? Exactly 365 days have passed since the girls were snatched from their boarding school dormitories in the dead of night in Chibok, northeastern Nigeria. They are still missing. For this we should all feel shame: shame that we live in a world where the lives of young girls can be shattered with impunity by fanatical thugs. Shame that when such horrendous acts occur, our collective attention span is so fleeting. A year ago, I could never have imagined that we would be here today, marking the grim 12-month milestone of these girls going missing. In the early days of their abduction much of the world stood as one, rallying around the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. On the ground in Nigeria as part of CNN's team covering the story, I was buoyed by this global solidarity. A year on, meet the man still fighting to #BringBackOurGirls . Caught in the blinding glare of global attention, and facing a tide of questions about their bungled response to the kidnappings, the Nigerian government felt the weight of accountability and was spurred to take greater action; offers of assistance from the likes of the US, UK, France, and China were accepted. Promise after promise was made by Nigerian government officials that the girls would come home -- so where are they, and where is the global outrage over these broken promises and broken dreams? My heart goes out to the grief-stricken loved ones of these missing girls on this painful anniversary. Poor and socially marginalized, all many of them have is their hope that their girls will one day return. Girls who escaped risk lives to go to school . The task of keeping that hope alive has largely been taken up by the handful of #BringBackOurGirls campaigners in Nigeria. These men and women have worked tirelessly to keep the story alive for the past year; their struggle has been a painful and increasingly lonely one. But as the world's gaze has shifted they have continued to meet the Nigerian government's silence with cries of: ""Bring Back Our Girls, now and alive!"" At this point, finding the girls will not be easy. But it can be done. It must be done. Malala offers 'solidarity, love, hope' to abducted schoolgirls . These girls are no different from your daughters, sisters, nieces: each has hopes and dreams of their own. But I also believe there is another reason these girls must be reunited with their families - in the words of Martin Luther King: ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects us all indirectly."" Our common humanity compels us to do our part, to right this shameful wrong. How the world has changed since the kidnappings .","Some 276 girls were kidnapped from their school in northeastern Nigeria by Boko Haram a year ago .

"(CNN)Video may have killed the radio star, but in Norway it's digital that's killing FM radio. In two years' time, the Scandinavian nation is slated to become the first in the world to phase out radio entirely. That doesn't mean that Norwegians will be left with radio silence; they'll merely have to tune in digitally. According to officials in Oslo, many in this nation of 5 million have already made the move. On FM, Norwegians can only find five stations. On the Digital Audio Broadcasting network, there are four times that number. Half the country already listens that way, said Culture Minister Thorhild Widvey. ""Listeners will have access to more diverse and pluralistic radio-content, and enjoy better sound quality and new functionality,"" Widvey said in a news release. Officials say the move will spur innovation because the cost of digital transmission will save some $25 million. But the country's radio waves won't cut out all once, a blog post on Radio.no explained. Radio will be phased out region by region, starting in January 2017 and concluding in December.","On FM, Norwegians can only find five stations .

"(CNN)Everybody loves a good comeback story -- especially one that's dino-sized. After its name was booted from science books for more than a century, a new study suggests that the Brontosaurus belongs to its own genera, and therefore deserves its own name. O.C. Marsh first named the Brontosaurus in 1879, after he received 25 crates of bones discovered at Como Bluff, Wyoming, according to the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History.  Similar to, though not as large as the Apatosaurus discovered a couple of years prior, Marsh named the dinosaur, ""Brontosaurus,"" or ""thunder lizard."" Apatosaurus had three sacral vertebrae in its hip region and Brontosaurus had five, according to the museum's website, so Marsh gave the dinosaurs two different names.  Later it was discovered that the number of sacral vertebrae is related to age: as the animal gets older, two of the vertebrae fuse to the sacrum. Paleontologist Elmer Riggs concluded in 1903 that the Brontosaurus was really a young Apatosaurus, and therefore must go by that name, according to the museum. Emanuel Tschopp, a paleontologist at the Nova University of Lisbon, Portugal, led this latest study, which took five years and included visits to 20 museums in Europe and the United States to collect data. By examining ""500 anatomical traits,"" Tschopp said he was able to ""reconstruct the family tree"" of Diplodocids -- the family Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus belong to. Tschopp ""looked at every single specimen,"" according to Jacques Gauthier, curator of vertebrate paleontology at Yale Peabody Museum and ""noted their characteristics,"" plugging data into an algorithm that revealed ""five species in the group of Diplodocids.""  Two of them are Brontosaurus-like and three are Apatosaurus-like, Gauthier said. While his findings have earned the excitement of Brontosaurus fans everywhere, Tschopp said he is ""expecting a debate about the case of Brontosaurus."" ""We think we have good evidence,"" he said, ""But I know there are other research groups that do not completely agree."" For Gauthier, Tschopp's discovery means changes are coming to the original Brontosaurus skeleton that has lived at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History since 1936. ""We're definitely going to have to change the label,"" he said.","Scientist: Fossils once renamed should again be classified as Brontosaurus .

"(CNN)Al Qaeda has fired a verbal salvo in a multifaction battle over Yemen, saying it's offering 20 kilograms of gold to anyone who kills or captures two prominent Shia Muslim opponents, including the leader of the rebels who overtook Yemen's capital. Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, in a news release and wanted poster distributed online, offers the reward for the death or capture of Houthi leader Abdelmalik Bedrudin Al-Houthi and former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Converted to currency, the gold reward would be worth about $774,000. AQAP referred to Al-Houthi and Saleh as the ""two heads of evil."" AQAP is one of several factions fighting to control Yemen. With Sunni Islamic roots, AQAP is a bitter enemy of the Houthi faction, which is Shia and widely believed to be supported by Iran. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- minority Shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January. The Houthis, allied with fighters loyal to Saleh, have since faced resistance from not only AQAP, but also a number of groups including forces loyal to Hadi. Also opposing the Houthis are Saudi Arabia and other predominantly Sunni nations, which last month began airstrikes against the rebels. At least 540 people -- including 311 civilians -- have died as a result of the fighting, the United Nations said Wednesday. A U.N. expert on refugees said other nations should prepare for ""massive displacement"" of Yemenis seeking safety. ""The international community must prepare for a worst case scenario,"" Chaloka Beyani, a professor of International Law at the London School of Economics, said. ""While efforts to reach a diplomatic solution are essential, the picture on the ground is extremely bleak and humanitarian responses must be stepped up as a matter of urgency."" About 1,000 people have already fled their homes during the two weeks of conflict.","The value of the bounty in American dollars is about $774,000 .

Hughes' friend Michael Shanahan told CNN that Hughes called him Wednesday morning and told him to check out the website. Although the post is not signed, he lists an email address of ""dhughes@thedemocracyclub.org,"" and the information in his self-description matches information about Hughes in public records. He refers to having multiple children -- the youngest an 11-year-old daughter -- and grandchildren as well. It's unclear exactly when the post published. Shanahan told CNN that when he searched for the site Wednesday morning, he was unable to find it. ""The purpose of it was to call attention to the United States concerning our campaign finance laws, or the lack thereof,"" Shanahan told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. Hughes had his first appearance in court scheduled for Thursday. On Wednesday, he took off in his gyrocopter from Maryland and traveled through restricted airspace over Washington, landing on the Capitol's West Lawn.  Inside the small personal aircraft he had letters for every member of Congress urging campaign finance reform. ""There's no need to worry --  I'm just delivering the mail,"" Hughes wrote in his post. The incident shut down the Capitol for part of the day. Hughes' main purpose ""was not so much to alert Congress to something they already know, but to make a statement, so that America would take notice,"" Shanahan said. The two men together run a website and nonprofit corporation called The Civilist Papers, which focuses on such issues, Shanahan said. In his post, Hughes wrote of his time spent in the Navy and described his family. Although he did not mention it in the post, one of Hughes' sons committed suicide 2 ½  years ago at the age of 24, the Tampa Bay Times reported. ""Something changed in me,"" Hughes told the paper. Public records show Hughes had a son named John Joseph Hughes who died. ""He told us that he felt like his son did something stupid, but he had made a point,"" said Ben Montgomery, the Tampa Bay Times reporter who broke the story of the gyrocopter flight. ""He learned a lesson out of that. And it was: If you want to make a point, you've got to do something big, as sad as that seems,"" Montgomery told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""He's been thinking about this for 2½ years. He's pictured every scenario you could possibly imagine,"" Montgomery said. Shanahan said Hughes mentioned the idea when the two were brainstorming a couple of years ago. Having grown up in Washington, Shanahan opposed the idea. ""I told him that, no, that was an insane plan because the chances are he was going to get killed."" ""Doug is like a pit bull when he gets an idea,"" Shanahan said.  ""He's very stubborn. And he finds ways around it. ... The word got out because he was telling people of his idea. And the Secret Service heard of it. So, they interviewed the two of us.  And after that, he said he was going to sell his copter and figure out something else to do. But then I noticed he did not sell this copter."" When Hughes called Shanahan on Wednesday morning, Shanahan said he did not try to talk Hughes out of the plan, but ""he was talking real quick, and I didn't know exactly what he meant by a lot of things.""","Doug Hughes, 61, said the point was to present solutions to corruption .

"(CNN)The bad news for Rio de Janeiro ahead of the 2016 Olympics keeps coming after scores of dead fish appeared in the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon. With just over a year to go before the city hosts the Games' rowing and canoe competitions, officials with the legislative assembly of Rio de Janeiro Monday launched an investigation into the causes of death both in the lagoon and in other lakes and bays in the state in which this phenomenon has occurred. The group will work in partnership with the State Environmental Institute (INEA) and the Secretariat of State for the Environment. Officials defended the belief that the latest rains caused a temperature change of the water and the excess of decaying organic matter, which would have led to a black of oxygen, killing the fish. The note released by officials highlighted that the amount of dead fish has generated a bad smell and inconvenience to those who live near the lagoon and all the tourists who flock to the area. Last week, newly obtained video from newspaper O Globo showed a sailor crashing into trash floating on Guanabara Bay. The incident took place on February 14 and involved professional sailors Breno Osthoff, 20, and Rafael de Almeida Sampaio, 35. According to Osthoff, the impact was so great the boat was forced onto its side. Rio de Janeiro has pledged to reduce pollution in the notoriously fetid bay, but last month in an interview with the country's largest sports channel  SporTV, Mayor Eduardo Paes admitted that the bay will remain mostly polluted for the games. ""The Olympics are also in a time that has very little rain, then this amount of debris that comes from five municipalities in the metropolitan region, with poor sanitation, is also controllable...I do not see as a problem for the Olympics,"" said Paes. Last year biologists said rivers leading into the bay contained a superbacteria that is resistant to antibiotics and can cause urinary, gastrointestinal and pulmonary infections. 2016 Olympics predictions .","Officials start to clean up scores of dead fish from the Lagoon Rodrigo de Freitas .

"(CNN)Anthony Ray Hinton is 58 years old. But in many ways, he is new to the world -- at least the one we know. Little things like using a fork, going out at night, tucking into bed without anyone checking on you; they're all strange for someone like Hinton who spent nearly 30 years on Alabama's death row. Until one week ago, when his murder convictions were wiped clean, and Hinton walked out of a county jail in Birmingham. ""I have to pinch myself to tell myself that I'm free,"" he told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Friday. ""It's going to take a little time, but I'll get used to it."" Hinton had to get used to much worse. For 30 years, he spent most of his time locked in a 5-by-7 cell. There was no going outside at night. The only permissible eating utensil was a plastic spoon. And life in the outside world passed him by: Hinton said his hardest day came in 2002, when he learned his mother had died. Hinton was convicted of killing two men -- Birmingham-area fast-food restaurant managers John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason -- but he always said he was innocent. Alabama inmate freed after 30 years on death row . The state decided to dismiss the charges against him after a new trial was ordered in 2014 when firearms experts testified that the revolver Hinton was said to have used could not be matched to other evidence in the case. The two killings also couldn't be linked to each other. Talking Friday to CNN, Jefferson County District Attorney Brandon Falls said the evidence simply wasn't there to retry the case. Falls pointed out that analysts testified that the ballistics evidence was ""inconclusive"" as to whether the bullets came from the gun in question. The victim of a similar crime did identify Hinton as her attacker, but that victim and a witness to that incident have since died, Falls said. When asked if Hinton's ordeal was an injustice, because the evidence about guns that helped convict Hinton should have been ruled inconclusive in 1985, Falls said, ""It appears it was."" The last time Hinton was free, Ronald Reagan was president, ""Back to the Future"" ruled the box office, and a first-class stamp cost 22 cents. He didn't get to see firsthand how the world changed in the decades since. His life was defined by a preordained routine: when to eat, when to leave his cell, when to sleep. Hinton didn't even see the moon and stars, really, for all these years. Did he ever want to give up? ""I didn't come too close to a breaking point,"" Hinton said. ""But I would be lying to you if I didn't tell you that Satan didn't tell me to kill myself. ... I would immediately tell Satan to get ... behind me."" What got him through all those tough times, he said, was his sense of humor. ""I had no choice,"" Hinton said of his ability to laugh and make others do the same. ""It was something that I was born with, but I never thought that it would come in handy that I would have to use it. ""Being on death row, we had to use (humor) every day. At least I did.""

"(CNN)The verdict of the opinion polls on the UK election debate between seven party leaders was simple enough: Between David Cameron of the Conservatives, Ed Miliband of Labour, Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats, Nigel Farage of the United Kingdom Independence Party, Natalie Bennett of the Green Party, Nicola Sturgeon of the Scottish National Party and Leanne Wood of Plaid Cymru, the Welsh Nationalists, there really was no clear winner. Comres for ITV, which staged the debate, had Cameron, Miliband and Farage tied first with 21% and Sturgeon close behind on 20%. ICM for The Guardian scored it Miliband 25, Cameron 24, Farage 19 and Sturgeon 17. YouGov for The Times put Sturgeon first with 28 points to 20 for Farage, 18 for Cameron and only 15 for Miliband. Back in the 1950s, UK politics was simpler: Labour and Conservatives combined took 97% of the votes. But nowadays they struggle to collect two-thirds of the national vote between them. In our anti-politics age nationalists and others have advanced and the leaders' TV debate was no gladiatorial contest with a straightforward outcome. Rather it was a cacophonous shouting match that probably gave all parties' supporters some satisfaction but which offered little new insight to the undecided voter. From a highly confused affair we can perhaps take six lessons: . As the incumbent Prime Minister, Cameron is probably wise to have refused all invitations to go head to head with Miliband alone in verbal fisticuffs. He has risked being labelled a coward for doing so but it was a tactical decision. Miliband has been given a hard time by the British media who have gloated over his difficulties in eating a bacon sandwich and presented him as an awkward geek. But Labour's leader is a perfectly capable debater. He could only gain from their confrontation. As it is, election time media exposure has already seen Miliband's ratings as a leader improve. The electoral strengths and weaknesses of the two main leaders are emerging. In an earlier clash involving separate sessions before a studio audience and in a grilling by UK TV's Grand Inquisitor Jeremy Paxman, Cameron proved vulnerable on broken promises to cut immigration, on the number of people employed on zero-hours contracts and on being too kind to the rich in his taxation policies. Miliband has looked unconvincing on how he will fund his promises to continue cutting the budget deficit and how he will curb immigration; he also is still embarrassed when questioners remind audiences how he knifed his brother David to get the leader's job. The impression so far is that Britain's voters don't much like the Conservatives despite the recovering economy but don't quite trust Labour to continue the improvement. Miliband, told by his handlers to look tough, is using the ""i"" word too much. Cameron is curiously short on passion. An oddity of the Seven Up debate was that many who viewed it will have no chance of voting for two of the leaders involved, Sturgeon of the Scottish National Party and Wood of Plaid Cymru. But Sturgeon's high score in the post-debate polls was significant. She was sharp and sassy. The number of seats gained by the Nationalists, currently on target to win as many as 50 of the 59 Westminster Parliament seats in Scotland, will be crucial. Last time Labour won 41 of those seats: The more the SNP take, the weaker Labour's chance of a majority at Westminster will be. Miliband says he won't form a coalition with the SNP but it could be difficult for Labour to govern without some deal with their bitter opponents north of the border. If there was a ""winner"" in the debate it was Nicola Sturgeon. Back in the 2010 UK election debates the clear victor was Clegg of the Liberal Democrats. Then the two main party leaders frequently found themselves parroting ""I agree with Nick."" By entering a coalition government with Cameron (in which the Lib Dems' insistence on raising the tax threshold for the lower paid has been a key element in increasing employment and economic recovery), Clegg surrendered the Lib Dems' previous ability to pick up protest votes. Clegg and his party have paid a heavy price for the compromises made in government, notably on student tuition fees. His debate performance was as good as any of the seven leaders but no poll gave him a rating of better than 10%. Perception is everything. In social media and studio focus groups there were plenty of plaudits for the Greens and even for Plaid Cymru's Wood but Clegg got hardly a mention. The United Kingdom Independence Party remains the joker in the pack. The party once dismissed by Cameron as a collection of ""fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists"" is a serious threat to the Conservatives -- and Labour -- despite the many gaffes that seemed to cost it some momentum lately. But UKIP, more than any of the others, is a personal vehicle for its leader and the debate was crucial for them. Grinning Farage's blokey saloon bar manner goes down well with studio audiences and he kept the focus on immigration. His party won't win many seats but he has ensured they can still tip the balance in plenty of contests, sometimes taking votes off the Conservatives, sometimes off Labour. Farage has always traded on the outer edge of political civilities and by insisting in the debate that immigrants were responsible for 60% of HIV cases he earned condemnation from other leaders. On social media, dominated by the young, that earned him the maximum boo count. To ""win"" a TV election debate you need to avoid gaffes yourself, to wrongfoot your opponent, and to offer some excitement that gives your campaign the chance to develop momentum. You need to produce vivid soundbites which will work their way into summary reports of the debates and into campaign replays. Nobody has yet succeeded in doing that in this campaign. The highly paid spin doctors employed by the three major parties are simply not worth their money. The emphasis has been on sound defense: Nobody has yet scored an exciting goal. As the campaign moves on, chances will have to be taken.

"(CNN)Facebook may soon need to add ""Just got served divorce papers"" to its list of relationship statuses now that a New York judge has said the social media site is an acceptable way for a Brooklyn woman to serve her husband with a summons for divorce. Ellanora Arthur Baidoo has been trying to divorce her husband for several years, according to her attorney, Andrew Spinnell. But, Spinnell said, he and his client haven't been able to find Victor Sena Blood-Dzraku to serve him the papers.  Baidoo has been able to reach her husband by phone and ""he has told her that he has no fixed address and no place of employment,"" according to court documents. ""He has also refused to make himself available to be served,"" the document said. After exhausting other ways of serving him the papers, Spinnell filed an application asking for ""service by alternate means,"" in this case, via social media. In his decision, Justice Matthew Cooper said the ""advent and ascendency of social media,"" means sites like Facebook and Twitter are the ""next frontier"" as ""forums through which a summons can be delivered."" Before Cooper agreed to her using Facebook, Baidoo had to prove the Facebook account belongs to her husband, and that he consistently logs on to the account and would therefore see the summons. Spinnell said Baidoo's marriage to Blood-Dzraku began to unravel shortly after they married in 2009 because her husband refused to participate in a Ghanian wedding ceremony that would include both their families . The couple never lived together, according to court documents. ""She's not asking for any money,"" Spinnell said, ""She just wants to move on with her life and get a divorce."" Spinnell said he has contacted Blood-Dzraku twice on Facebook, but has yet to hear back. If Blood-Dzraku refuses the summons, Spinnell said the judge can move forward with a ""divorce by default"" for his client. Blood-Dzraku could not be reached for comment.","Ellanora Arthur Baidoo has been trying to divorce her husband for several years .

"(CNN)It sounds like the plot for a science fiction movie. Someone has a horrific accident and winds up in the hospital, brain dead and on life support. Doctors approach the family about organ donation, but instead of saving as many as eight lives, the family is asked to donate the whole body to save just one individual. Perhaps a quadriplegic with a mind that outmatches their malfunctioning body. As crazy as this sounds, to put an entire head on a new body, a human body, Italian physician Dr. Sergio Canavero says we are approaching  HEAVEN (an acronym for head anastomosis venture; anastomosis is surgically connecting two parts). The pieces are coming together but there are still many hurdles to jump. Canavero says he has part of the funding secured, although he says he can't yet disclose where the money is coming from as a condition of the funding. He's also taking the 2015 layman's approach with crowd funding and book sales. He has identified Valery Spiridonov as the first patient. The 30-year-old Russian man suffers from a rare genetic disorder called Werdnig-Hoffman disease. Canavero says the man volunteered. The two men have talked via Skype but they have yet to meet in person and Canavero has not reviewed Spiridonov's medical records. Canavero says he has a stack of emails and letters from people who want this procedure. Many of them are transsexuals who want a new body, he says. But he insists the first patients will be people who are suffering from a muscle wasting disease. Another big obstacle is the need for a partner. Canavero can't just do this in his own Frankenstein lab. He needs a major academic medical center to host this endeavor and he has his eyes set on the United States. He hopes to get a buy-in this summer when he presents his plan to the American Academy of Neurological and Orthopedic Surgeons, or AANOS, at its annual conference in June. He's counting on getting the green light he needs for the first human whole head transplant to take place in 2017. Nick Rebel, executive director of AANOS, says the group is not endorsing Canavero, it is simply giving him a platform to hear what he has to say. If Canavero doesn't get the support he needs in the United States, he'll look to China and his timeline will slide by a year. Once these pieces are in place, Canavero says he'll put together a staff of 150 nurses and doctors. Many of them, like the patient, are already identified because they've asked to be part of this team. Then they'll need to practice for what is anticipated to be a 36-hour operation. ""I say two years is the time needed for the team to reach perfect synchronization,"" Canavero speculates. But what about the science? Is such an idea even plausible? He says he has research that supports it. Canavero points to Dr. Robert White, who transplanted the head of one monkey to the body of another at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in 1970. The monkey died after eight days, because the body rejected the new head. Before ithe monkey died, it could not move because the spinal cord of the head and body were not connected. The monkey also was unable to breathe on its own. The paper in which Canavero outlined his procedure references a different 1971 experiment White conducted with six monkey heads, none of which survived more than 24 hours. But Canavero says advances in science and medicine since then eliminate the problems White faced. Dr. Hunt Batjer, chairman of neurological surgery at UT Southwestern and president-elect of the American Association for Neurological Surgeons, says White's research is not validation for a human head transplant. ""[It's] a 45-year-old reference in a primate and there is no evidence that the spinal cord was anastomosed functionally,"" he says. Batjer further explains that it's a great leap to go from brain survival of the surgery to restoring body function, which White did not look at. Canavero is confident in his writing and in conversation. He cites White's monkeys and even the success of German researchers who helped paralyzed rats walk, giving no pause to the fact that such research is more likely to go nowhere than to make it to human clinical trials. He published his paper in the free, online, medical journal Surgical Neurology International in 2013. He walks readers through a scenario, outlining the key points that will make this work, including cooling the spinal cord before severing it. Doing so with an ultra-sharp blade will avoid the damage experienced by spinal cord injury patients, he says. He'll use a ""magic ingredient"" as a sealant to fuse the spinal cord back together and offers a few options for what that ingredient could be. The nerves, having been color-coded when separated, will be carefully aligned and this will all be done very quickly because time is key. An impossibility, according to Batjer. He conceded that the airway, the spine, the major veins and arteries, can all be put back together, but the spinal cord is the problem. He says the result would be the inability to move or breathe. ""I would not wish this on anyone, I would not allow anyone to do it to me, there are a lot of things worse than death,"" Batjer says. The science isn't there to support this, says Arthur Caplan, Ph.D., director of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center. He says it's nothing more than a big PR stunt, and calls Canavero ""nuts."" Caplan says this has to be done in many animals before it's tried on humans. Caplan also points out that if Canavero can do this, he should first be helping paralyzed patients by fixing their spinal cords, before transplanting whole bodies. As for the patients, Caplan says, ""their bodies would end up being overwhelmed with different pathways and chemistry than they are used to and they'd go crazy."" In his paper, Canavero says identity issues could be a problem as the head gets used to its new body. He also says pain could be a problem. As far as immunosuppression, Canavero points to today's transplant successes as evidence this is not a problem. Caplan isn't buying it. He's seen how difficult it is for his NYU colleagues who perform face transplants. The levels of anti-rejection medications required are so high they put patients at risk for cancer and kidney problems. He says it doesn't make sense that you'd poison a new body with immunosuppressant medications to make a head transplant work. Another issue Caplan has seen with face transplant patients is they don't always get full function of their new organ. ""It's not like you can unscrew your head and put it on someone else,"" Caplan says. Dr. Robert Ruff, the Veterans Affairs national director for neurology, calls it farfetched and farcical, not to mention unlikely to work. He says this is more like centuries away, not years. ""It would be impossible to predict that far into the future,"" Ruff says. Canavero insists, though, ""We can already do this.""","Dr. Sergio Canavero says he is two years away from performing the first total human head transplant .

"(CNN)The story of Anthony Stokes was supposed to have a happy ending. Instead it ended Tuesday, police say, with the teen heart transplant recipient carjacking someone, burglarizing a home, shooting at an elderly woman, leading police on a high speed chase and then dying after his car hit a pole. In 2013, the teen's family told media that an Atlanta hospital rejected him for heart transplant surgery due to what the hospital described in a letter as Stokes' ""history of non-compliance."" At the time, Mark Bell was acting as a Stokes family spokesman. Bell told CNN that a doctor told the family that Anthony's low grades and time in juvenile detention factored into the hospital's decision to deny him a heart. ""The doctor made the decision that he wasn't a good candidate because of that,"" Bell said then. ""I guess he didn't think Anthony was going to be a productive citizen."" About a week after Stokes' story made headlines, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta gave him a heart. On Tuesday, Stokes carjacked someone at a mall, kicked in the door of a home in Roswell, Georgia, and fired a shot at an elderly woman, who called 911, said Roswell police spokeswoman Lisa Holland. Stokes drove away in a black SUV, she said. Police spotted the car and ran its plates which showed it had been stolen. Police chased the vehicle. Stokes lost control of the car, hit a pedestrian and then a pole, Holland said. The vehicle was nearly halved, she said. The pedestrian is stable and in good condition, according to CNN affiliate WSB. Stokes died at a hospital, Holland said. In 2013, Stokes' family provided media with a letter they said was from Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. ""Anthony is currently not a transplant candidate due to having a history of noncompliance, which is one of our center's contraindications to listing for heart transplant,"" it read. Assessing compliance for potential transplant recipients is important because if a patient doesn't strictly take all required medicines as directed, he or she could die within weeks of leaving the hospital, said Dr. Ryan Davies, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Delaware, told CNN. Davies was not involved with this case. When Stokes' family was trying to get him a heart, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference advocated for the teen. SCLC's the Rev. Samuel Mosteller told CNN that he was disappointed. ""We got this young man a second chance in life,"" he said. SCLC referred the teenager to a mentor program in the Atlanta area, but Mosteller said that he wasn't sure if the teenager participated. ""What happened between the time in 2013 to now, I don't really know,"" he said. ""How much Anthony recognized the gravity of things and did what he needed to do to make himself a viable citizen, I don't know. But we tried.""

"(CNN)The sun hadn't risen at Garissa University College. Most students slept in their beds. A few had woken up to head to early morning Christian prayers. Then the terror began. It started with an explosion and gunshots around 5:30 a.m. Thursday (10:30 p.m. ET Wednesday) at the Kenyan school's front gates. The attackers continued to fire as they stalked through campus, with the Red Cross saying they stopped at a girls' dormitory. At one point, they burst into a room where Christians had gathered and took hostages, said lecturer Joel Ayora. A student in the room told Alex Kubasu, a reporter with CNN affiliate Citizen TV, that the terrorists sprayed bullets indiscriminately, striking his thigh. ""Then they proceeded to the hostels,"" Ayora told CNN, referring to the university dorm, ""shooting anybody they came across -- except their fellows, the Muslims."" According to AFP, the gunmen separated the students by religion and allowed Muslims to leave. This would be consistent with the past practices of Al-Shabaab, the Somalia-based terror group that's claimed responsibility for the attack. That's what Al-Shabaab did in a December raid on a quarry in the Kenyan village of Kormey, near the Somali border, that ended with at least 36 killed. Whatever their religion, hundreds of students managed to escape, said Dennis Okari, a reporter with CNN affiliate NTV. Some ran. Some crawled. All feared for their lives. And they were the lucky ones. It wasn't until about 15 hours after the attack began that the explosions and gunfire around Garissa finally ended. Interior Ministry Secretary Joseph Nkaissery announced that four terrorists were killed and the operation had ended ""successfully."" By then, 147 people were dead and plans were ""underway to evacuate students and other affected persons,"" the Kenya National Disaster Operation Centre tweeted. ""It is a very sad day for Kenya,"" Nkaissery said. Some of those students, at one point or another, were believed to be hostages in one of the four dormitories on campus. Yet others like Ayora managed to find safety, in his case at the staff residence. Others escaped the college's grounds. Okari, for instance, told CNN that he saw about 200 people sitting in the scorching mid-90-degree heat Thursday in a corner of a Garissa airstrip, surrounded by military officials. One student, Japhet Mwala, recalled to AFP how ""everyone started running"" after hearing blasts and gunshots. ""There were those who were not able to leave the hostels where the gunmen headed and started firing,"" Mwala said. ""I am lucky to be alive, because I jumped through the fence with other students."" Rosalind Mugambi fled into a nearby field with ""bullets following us."" She escaped unscathed, but a few of her friends did not. ""We saw some bloodstains,""  Mugambi told AFP, ""and they were shot."" Such terrorism, sadly, isn't new to the people of eastern Kenya. And that's largely thanks to Al-Shabaab. While it is based in Somalia, the militant group has made bloody incursions into neighboring Kenya -- most notoriously a 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall that left at least 67 dead. A primary aim of such attacks is thought to be sowing terror. There's also a religious undercurrent, given Al-Shabaab's once and possibly future goal of creating a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Needless to say, that aim isn't shared in most places -- particularly in Kenya, where more than 80% of citizens are Christian. Such violence is more likely in towns like Garissa, given its location 90 miles west of the Somali border. What makes Thursday's attack different is what was targeted -- an institute of higher learning, presumably filled with innocent students with no direct part in the Kenyan and allied governments' fight against Al-Shabaab. Such an attack is more reminiscent of what other Islamist extremist groups, the Pakistani Taliban and Boko Haram, did in respectively attacking a school in Peshawar, Pakistan, and kidnapping more than 200 girls at a school in Chibok, Nigeria. Garissa University College began in the 1990s as Garissa Teacher Training College before evolving, by government decree, into its current form as a degree-granting institution in 2011. As of this spring, the school had schools of education, information science, and arts and social sciences. And it was growing, with its staff of 75 set to expand to 200 by year's end, according to the college's website. It's too early to tell what the future now holds for Garissa University College. But Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday urged people around the African nation ""to stay calm as we resolve this matter."" ""This is a moment,"" Kenyatta said, ""for everyone throughout the country to be vigilant as we continue to confront and defeat our enemies.""

"(CNN)A white casket sat at the front of New Shiloh Baptist Church in West Baltimore as a gospel choir sang for a large crowd gathered to honor Freddie Gray. The 25-year-old died in police custody 15 days ago after he was arrested on a weapons charge. His death from a severe spinal chord injury sparked widespread outrage toward the Baltimore Police Department. Gray's death in custody is the latest in a string of high profile deaths involving African-Americans and law enforcement. Many have demanded answers about what happened to Gray and his funeral drew civil rights leaders, politicians, and relatives of others who died in police custody. Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland spoke at the funeral: ""To mother Gloria and to the entire family, I want you to know we stand with you during this difficult time."" Cummings said he ""looked at the cameras"" and reflected on the great amount of attention Gray was receiving in death: ""Did anybody recognize Freddie Gray when he was alive?"" he asked. Cummings said that Gray joined the church in 2001. He was in youth choir and was a junior usher. ""He loved church,"" Cummings said. Gray also played football. ""Did you see him?"" the representative asked. ""There are those who will tell you don't cry. I'm not going to say that,"" Cummings said. Gray also had a history of run-ins with the law. According to court documents CNN obtained, there were more than 20 criminal court cases in Maryland against Gray, and five of those cases were still active at the time of his death. The cases involve mostly drug-related charges, but there are charges from March for second-degree assault and destruction of property. Gray was due in court on a possession charge on April 24. He had been in and out of prison since 2009 for various drug cases, according to the Maryland Department of Corrections. Families United for Justice was also at the funeral. The group includes relatives of Eric Garner, who died last July after a New York City police officer put him in a chokehold. Protests erupted after a grand jury declined to indict that officer. Other members of the group include relatives of Amadou Diallo, who was fatally shot by New York police officers, and Alberta Spruill, who died of a heart attack after police threw a stun grenade into her apartment during a botched raid. The White House sent Cabinet Secretary Broderick Johnson, chair of the Obama administration's My Brother's Keeper Task Force; Heather Foster, an adviser in the White House Office of Public Engagement; and Elias Alcantara from the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. Exactly what happened to Gray remains a mystery. His family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died. News of Gray's smashed upper spine and the delay in getting him medical care has triggered outrage across the country. Hundreds of protesters peacefully rallied on the streets of Baltimore on Saturday against the alleged police role in Gray's death. A small group turned violent. About a dozen young men smashed police vehicles with garbage cans, climbed on top of the cars and stomped on them. Some hurled water bottles and other objects at police. Others funneled their anger toward local businesses, looting or damaging a 7-Eleven, a Michael Kors store and a Subway restaurant. Baltimore police arrested 35 people, including four juveniles. Six officers suffered minor injuries during the chaos, which ended a week of civil and peaceful protests. Gray's twin sister deplored the violence. ""My family wants to say, 'Can y'all please, please stop the violence,' "" Fredericka Gray said Saturday night. ""Freddie Gray would not want this."" Baltimore City Paper said its photo editor, J.M. Giordano, was tackled and beaten by police while covering the protests. The paper said Giordano was standing near protesters when someone threw a rock at police. Officers responded, and Giordano was unable to get out of the way. ""They just swarmed over me,"" he said. ""I got hit. My head hit the ground. They were hitting me, then someone pulled me out."" The incident was caught on video, which Baltimore City Paper posted online. And Reuters photographer Sait Serkan Gurbuz said Baltimore police detained him Saturday night. Officers called the detention of the two journalists inadvertent. ""One journalist (Gurbuz) was released with a criminal citation, which is being recalled,"" police said in a statement. ""One journalist (Giordano) was released without any charges."" Cell phone video of Gray's arrest shows him screaming and being dragged, with some witnesses saying he looked like his leg was injured. Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said he was appalled that Gray did not receive proper care immediately. He also said officers should have given Gray timely medical care ""multiple times"" -- such as at the site of the arrest and at other times during his transport to the police station. Batts also said there are no excuses for the fact that Gray was not buckled into the transport van. But Baltimore's Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 shot back: ""These comments appear to be politically driven and in direct contrast to the commissioner's own request not to jump to any conclusions until the entire investigation is complete,"" union President Gene Ryan said in a written statement. Five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators, Batts said. The sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions. And while the preliminary work on Gray's autopsy has been completed, the medical examiner's office is waiting on toxicology results and might ask spinal experts to look at the case, authorities said. A full report could take 30 to 45 days. Not just Freddie Gray: Others who died in police custody . Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta; Miguel Marquez reported from Baltimore.

"(CNN)I've been a chef in some form or another since I was 14 years old, but I didn't become a food activist until much later. It was 2007, and a young girl my wife mentored was found rooting through the trash just to find something to eat. That inspired me to found Food Policy Action and become politically active in a range of food issues, from hunger to factory farms. Of course, I haven't been alone in this work. One of the biggest catalysts has been ""The Meatrix,"" a 2003 animation parody based on ""The Matrix"" and produced by the GRACE Communications Foundation, which crystallized the public health risks and environmental harms of factory farming. Recently, ""The Meatrix: Relaunched"" came out. Much more than a comical redux, it's an important benchmark in the evolution of the sustainable food movement and compels us to look back at how far we've come over the last decade -- and how far we still have to go. A decade ago, concepts like ""sustainable farming,"" ""animal welfare"" and ""organic food"" were considered fringe. While some consumers were beginning to take interest in where their meat and produce came from, public knowledge of sustainable food was limited. The standard gut-wrenching images of animal cruelty and sickly calves were ineffectual and mostly turned people off instead of urging them to make better food choices. Meanwhile, factory farms continued to reap large profits while producing subpar meat, polluting air and water resources, and damaging the public's health. To be sure, America's food system is complex, and some may argue that industrial farming has been a necessity to meet our country's food needs. However, the quality of our food has been sacrificed at this supposed altar of necessity, as industrial farms reap enormous profits that they direct toward lobbying rather than improving the quality of food they produce. In 2014 alone, the biggest meatpackers and their trade groups spent a combined $4.3 million on lobbyists. And it has paid off for them: Factory farms often avoid penalties for the damage they cause to the environment and public health; and they receive ridiculous subsidies from the U.S. government that totaled $58.7 million in 2012, according to the Environmental Working Group. These factors drive down the cost of industrially sourced meat at a rate that smaller farms can't keep up with. And since the actual costs of industrially raised meat are hidden, humanely raised meat appears expensive by comparison. That's neither fair nor safe. We all deserve to know where the food we eat comes from and that it is wholesome, and we need our elected officials to take a stand against big agri-businesses to quit letting them profit off of meat and produce that jeopardize the health of the environment and the public. It's time that consumer demand for sustainable and humane food trumps the power that industrial farms hold over our elected officials. The original ""Meatrix"" cartoon used pop culture references and family-friendly cartoons to educate consumers about the dangers of factory farming, compel them to make better food choices and spark a wave of online advocacy for better government oversight of big agriculture and meat companies. As a result, it became one of the first viral videos ever to effectively expose consumers to the realities happening behind the doors of industrial farms and the damage these facilities were doing to the environment, our public health and surrounding communities. The rise in consumer knowledge has led to an increased demand for sustainably sourced food that is healthier and tastes better. GRACE has relaunched the Eat Well Guide, an online directory of 25,000 sustainable farms, restaurants, food co-ops and farmers' markets that allows consumers to make better choices about the food they eat and provide for their families. And we at Food Policy Action have produced a legislative scorecard. We need to ask members of Congress to promote sustainable farming, not factory farms. We need them to support sensible food policies that ensure that everyone has access to food and water. Congress should vote against the DARK Act, which would block any federal or state action that required labels for foods made with genetically engineered ingredients even at the expense of the environment, public health and local economies. As more consumers are educated, they have the power to take action and call on elected officials to support sustainable farmers, not factory farms. Together, we can create a sustainable food system in America that is better for our environment and our health.","Tom Colicchio: ""The Meatrix: Relaunched"" is an important benchmark of the evolution of sustainable food movement .

"(CNN)Dan Swangard knows what death looks like. As a physician, he has seen patients die in hospitals, hooked to morphine drips and overcome with anxiety. He has watched dying drag on for weeks or months as terrified relatives stand by helplessly. Recently, however, his thoughts about how seriously ill people die have become personal. Swangard was diagnosed in 2013 with a rare form of metastatic cancer. To remove the cancer, surgeons took out parts of his pancreas and liver, as well as his entire spleen and gallbladder. The operation was successful but Swangard, 48, knows there's a strong chance the disease will return. And if he gets to a point where there's nothing more medicine can do, he wants to be able to control when and how his life ends. ""It's very real for me,"" said Swangard, who lives in Bolinas, Calif. ""This could be my own issue a year from now."" That's one of the reasons Swangard joined a California lawsuit last month seeking to let doctors prescribe lethal medications to certain patients who want to hasten death. If he were given only months to live, Swangard said, he can't say for certain whether he would take them. ""But I want to be able to make that choice,"" he said. The right-to-die movement has gained renewed momentum in California and around the nation following the highly publicized death of an East Bay woman with brain cancer. Brittany Maynard, 29, moved to Oregon to take advantage of its ""Death with Dignity"" law and died in November after taking a fatal dose of barbiturates prescribed by her doctor. The California lawsuit asks the court to protect physicians from liability if they prescribe lethal medications to patients who are both terminally ill and mentally competent to decide their fate. The lawsuit argues that while it is against the law in California for anyone to assist in another's suicide, these cases are not suicides. Rather, the suit argues, they are choices by a dying person on how his or her life should end and decisions about one's own body protected under the state constitution. Separately, two California state senators have proposed a bill that would allow doctors to prescribe lethal medication to certain terminally ill adults. Three states -- Oregon, Washington and Vermont -- already have laws allowing physician-assisted deaths. Courts in New Mexico and Montana also have ruled that aid in dying is legal, and a suit was also recently filed in New York. Legislation is pending in several other states. Kathryn Tucker, an attorney on several of the court cases, is also spearheading the California lawsuit. This time, she and her legal team decided to include among the plaintiffs two doctors with life-threatening illnesses, Swangard and a retired San Francisco obstetrician. Physicians ""have a very deep and broad understanding about what the journey to death can be like,"" said Tucker, executive director of the Disability Rights Legal Center. ""The curtain is pulled back. For lay people, death is much more mysterious."" Historically, doctors have been some of the most vocal critics of assisted suicide, also called aid-in-dying. The American Medical Association still says that ""physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer."" Similarly, though it hasn't taken a position on currently proposed legislation, the California Medical Association has said that helping patients die conflicts with doctors' commitment to do no harm. ""It is the physicians' job to take care of the patient and that is amplified when that patient is most sick,"" said spokeswoman Molly Weedn. But a recent survey of 21,000 doctors in the U.S. and Europe shows views may be shifting. According to Medscape, the organization that did the survey, 54 percent of American doctors support assisted suicide, up from 46 percent four years earlier. Swangard is among those who believe that taking care of patients means letting them choose how their lives should end. That's not the same as killing patients or facilitating suicide, he said. Swangard completed his medical residency in San Francisco in the middle of the AIDS crisis; young men were dying all around him. Throughout his career as an internal medicine doctor, a hospice volunteer and now an anesthesiologist, he has become frustrated with how the medical system handles death. Doctors spend so much time trying to extend life that few focus on what patients want in their last days, he said. ""I don't think we know how to die,"" he said. ""We fight tooth and nail to keep that from happening."" Swangard's own illness was discovered in early 2013 during a long overdue check-up. He hadn't been worried about his health -- he was obsessed with fitness, swimming regularly and seeing a trainer twice a week. But when the doctor pressed on Swangard's stomach, he felt a mango-sized mass. He had a visceral feeling, he said, ""something bad was happening."" Within a week, a surgeon found a neuroendocrine tumor in the pancreas and metastasis in the liver. It was the same cancer that took Steve Jobs' life -- one that doesn't generally respond to chemotherapy or radiation. ""My fears became real,"" he said. The doctors told him they believed they got all the cancerous cells. But Swangard was tormented by questions: Am I going to be alive in a year? Is my cancer going to come back? ""I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't exercising, I was marinating in my own sadness and fear of what this all meant,"" he said. ""I thought, 'This is going to kill me.'"" Since his diagnosis, Swangard said he has had a greater understanding of his patients' struggles. Occasionally, he holds their hands and tells them he has been where they are. Earlier this year, a physician friend asked him if he'd be willing to join the California case. Swangard didn't hesitate. He didn't go into medicine to help dying people linger and wants to help change that approach — for his patients and for himself. When he dies, Swangard said, he wants to be surrounded by people he loves. He doesn't want to be in a drug-induced haze, nor consumed by worry about what's next. He wants to be able to say goodbye. ""It is a little bit of a blessing to know how I might die,"" he said. ""I don't think a lot of patients have insight into what to expect."" These days, he wears a Buddhist prayer bracelet, a reminder to focus on the present. He cut his work hours, swims as often as he can and meditates regularly. At home, he stares out at the ocean, often watching dolphins pass by. He makes every effort to stay calm and healthy. He is in remission but he knows that what happens with the cancer is largely outside his control. An MRI last year showed a small lesion in his liver, which doctors are watching closely. ""It's this big unknown,"" he said. Dr. Robert Liner, a fellow plaintiff who only recently met Swangard, lives with the same uncertainty. On his 69th birthday in May 2013, the retired obstetrician had a bad cough. He felt tired and short of breath. His wife took him to the hospital, where doctors discovered malignant masses on his kidneys — advanced-stage lymphoma. After radiation and chemotherapy, the tumors shrank. He also is in remission. But if the cancer comes back, he said, ""the prospects are not going to be good."" He often thinks of a former patient, a 25-year-old woman with metastatic ovarian cancer. She wanted to die while she still was able to communicate. Liner wasn't able to help ease her death because the law wouldn't let him. ""I felt like I'd failed her,"" he said. Years before his diagnosis, Liner, now 70, became involved with Compassion & Choices, an organization that promotes aid-in-dying. He has a shelf of books in his San Francisco home devoted to the subject: Being Mortal, Dying Right, Knocking on Heaven's Door. He keeps a stack of notecards with quotes about the end of life, which he often recites in speeches to church groups or senior centers. One reads, ""The best preparation for death is a life well-lived."" He believes having medication to hasten death helps terminally ill people live fully in their last weeks or months without being immobilized by fear. ""If you are riddled with anxiety, you are not free to concentrate on what's most meaningful to you,"" he said. Like Swangard, Liner doesn't know if he would take the medication. He recently married the woman he calls his ""beloved"" and said he has lots of plans for his retirement years, including writing a screenplay and improving his piano playing. ""My wife says I'd be hanging on to life by my fingernails,"" he said. But that decision should be his to make, with his family and his doctor, he said. ""I want the comfort of knowing it's up to me when enough is enough,"" he said.

"(CNN)Saudi special forces assisted Yemeni fighters targeting Houthis and their allies in Aden, a Saudi source told CNN. The special forces were on the ground in noncombat roles ""coordinating and guiding"" the battle against Houthi forces and fighters loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the source said. They also have helped parachute in weapons and communications equipment. Houthi rebels, meanwhile, withdrew from the presidential palace and other key parts of the southern port city of Aden following heavy Saudi airstrikes, according to the source. The withdrawal signaled a reversal from rebel gains the previous day, when Houthi forces seized the presidential palace. President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, who fled the country last month, had stayed for a period of time after Houthis secured control of the capital, Sanaa, in January. Houthis had controlled most large districts in Aden amid ongoing clashes. The latest action heats up an already intense conflict that could have ramifications across the Middle East. If the Saudi-led coalition of nine countries takes the fight to the ground in Yemen, the consequences could be severe. Houthis are battle-hardened guerrilla fighters and could cross into Saudi Arabia. They've already threatened suicide bomb attacks inside Saudi Arabia. Yemen, already the home base to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, teeters on the brink of becoming a failed state and an even more fertile breeding ground for extremism. The United Nations, citing reports from humanitarian partners, said 519 people have been killed and nearly 1,700 others wounded in the past two weeks. Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes and sought refuge in Djibouti and Somalia, Valerie Amos, under-secretary-general and emergency relief coordinator, said in a statement. Two humanitarian workers were killed Friday in Yemen. The brothers working for the local branch of the Yemen Red Crescent Society were shot in Aden while evacuating wounded people to a waiting ambulance, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported. They were identified as Khaled Ahmed Bahuzaim and Mohammed Ahmed Bahuzaim. Two Saudi border guards were killed Friday after an exchange of fire with Houthi rebels along the kingdom's frontier with Yemen, officials told CNN. A border guard was killed in a cross-boundary fire exchange with militants, the Saudi Press Agency reported Thursday. That marked Saudi Arabia's first publicly known military death since it launched airstrikes against rebels inside its southern neighbor. U.S. Navy warships were patrolling off Yemen in search of suspicious shipping in the region, in particular any weapons shipments from Iran to the Houthi rebels they are supporting in Yemen, a U.S. defense official told CNN on Thursday. The Navy this week came across a Panamanian-registered cargo ship that had left an Iranian port, the official said. Based on the route of the ship from Iran to Yemen, the Navy declared it a ""vessel of interest"" and requested permission from the captain to search it. The ship was found to be carrying cement and construction materials, the official said. It was sent on its way. The offshore area has been a route for weapons smuggling into Yemen, as well as Sudan and Gaza, so the Navy has maintained a regular surveillance presence there. The official said that increased fighting in the last several days in southern Yemen has resulted in other ships trying to dock to help civilians leave the country. Saudi and allied warplanes struck rebels in Yemen last week, with Saudi Arabia threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor's civil war. The swift and sudden action involved 100 Saudi jets, 30 from the United Arab Emirates, 15 each from Kuwait and Bahrain, 10 from Qatar, and a handful from Jordan, Morocco and Sudan, plus naval help from Pakistan and Egypt, according to a Saudi adviser. The Houthi rebels are Shiite Muslims who have taken over Sanaa and had captured parts of its second-largest city, Aden. The Sunni Saudis consider the Houthis proxies for the Shiite government of Iran and fear another Shiite-dominated state in the region. Officials: Al Qaeda fighters free 270 from Yemeni prisons .

"(CNN)A Detroit mother arrested last month after police discovered the bodies of two of her children inside a freezer was arraigned this week on murder and torture charges. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy charged Mitchelle Angela Blair on Wednesday with killing her then 13-year-old daughter, Stoni Ann Blair, and her then 9-year-old son, Stephen Gage Berry. According to Detroit Police Chief James Craig, the bodies were found wrapped in plastic inside the freezer by a bailiff performing a court ordered eviction on March 24. The Wayne County medical examiner has since determined that Stoni died from multiple blunt trauma injuries and Stephen from multiple blunt trauma and thermal injuries. Both were determined to be homicides, according to spokesman Ryan Bridges. According to CNN affiliate WDIV,  investigators believe Stephen was scalded with hot water, beaten and strangled in August 2012, while Stoni was killed in May 2013. A message left for Blair's court appointed attorney, who entered not guilty pleas on her behalf at her arraignment, wasn't immediately returned. In addition to the two counts of premeditated murder -- each of which carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole --  Blair, 35, has been charged with two counts of torture, four counts of felony child abuse and one count of committing child abuse in the presence of another child. She has two other children, a 17-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son, both of whom are now in in protective custody, according to Worthy. Blair will be back in court June 19 for a court ordered competency hearing.","Murder and torture charges for Detroit mom after bodies found in her freezer .

"Miami (CNN)World heavyweight boxing champion Wladimir Klitschko has an important title defense coming up, but his thoughts continue to be dominated by the ongoing fight for democracy in Ukraine. Speaking to CNN from his Miami training base ahead of the April 25 showdown with American challenger Bryant Jennings in New York, Klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset. ""My country is unfortunately suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around,"" Klitschko told CNN. ""I never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us, so that Ukrainians and Russians are going to be divided with blood,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, we don't know how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get. The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting."" Klitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century. Vitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year. Tensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides. The crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia. The move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead. The following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date. ""People are dying in Ukraine every single day,"" Klitschko said. ""I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen."" But with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship. ""I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,"" he said. ""Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want. ""If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and be part of the former Soviet Union, we disagree with that. We want to be in freedom. ""We have achieved many things in moving forward and showed to the world that we do not want to live under a dictatorship."" Klitschko, whose comments were made as part of a wide-ranging interview for CNN's Human to Hero series, is routinely kept abreast of developments in Ukraine by brother Vitali but also returns home whenever he can. ""As much time as I can spend, I am there in the Ukraine. It's not like I am getting the news from mass media and making my own adjustments and judgments on what's going on. It's an actual presence and understanding from the inside ... It obviously affects my life, it affects the life of my family."" The 39-year-old and his fiancée Hayden Panettiere celebrated happier times last December when the American actress gave birth to a baby daughter, Kaya. ""I need to get used to it that I'm a father, which is really exciting. I hope I'm going to have a big family with multiple kids,"" he said. Klitschko isn't sure when he'll finally hang up his gloves. ""I don't know how long I can last ... motivation and health have to be there to continue."" But after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the Ukrainian is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against Jennings -- Klitschko is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country's corner in the opposite way outside the ring. ""I just really want that we'll have less violence in the world ... I hope in peace we can do anything, but if we have war then it's definitely going to leave us dull and numb."" Watch Wladimir Klitschko's Human to Hero interview on CNN's World Sport program on Wednesday April 8 at 1130, 1245, 1445, 2130, 2245 and 2345 and Thursday April 9 at 0445 (All times GMT) and here online.","Reigning world heavyweight champion discusses Ukraine crisis .

"(CNN)""It's showtime!"" Michael Keaton paid homage -- ever so slightly -- to his roles in ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Batman"" in his third turn hosting ""Saturday Night Live"" this weekend. Keaton acknowledged in his opening monologue that a lot has changed since he first hosted the comedy sketch show in 1982. ""I had a baby -- he's 31. I also have a new girlfriend -- she's 28,"" he said. Fans who were hoping for a full-blown revival of Keaton's most memorable characters might have been a little disappointed. SNL cast members Taran Killam and Bobby Moynihan begged the actor with a song to ""play"" Batman and Beetlejuice with them. All they got in response were a couple of one-liners. Overall, Keaton's performance drew high marks from viewers and critics for its ""deadpan"" manner and ""unpredictable weirdness,"" in the words of A.V. Club's Dennis Perkins. Fans also delighted in a cameo from ""Walking Dead"" star Norman Reedus during Weekend Update. Keaton scored some laughs from the audience as an ad executive who's not very good at his job, a confused grandfather and a high school teacher who gets asked to the prom in a riff on the romantic comedy ""She's All That."" Other crowd-pleasing spots included a Scientology parody music video and a news conference spoofing the NCAA student-athlete debate. The show also poked fun at CNN with cast member Cecily Strong playing anchor Brooke Baldwin. Baldwin said on Twitter that she's taking it as a ""crazy compliment"" and shared a clip from the skit.","Michael Keaton hosted  ""Saturday Night Live""  for the first time in 1982 .

"(CNN)Just over a month ago, Kamron Taylor sat in an Illinois courtroom to hear a jury convict him of murder. Early Wednesday morning, Taylor sat in an Illinois jail. Hiding outside his cell. Ready to pounce. When he did, his victim was a correctional officer making his rounds, according to Kankakee County Sheriff Timothy Bukowski. Taylor beat up the guard, put on his uniform and took his keys. He then walked out of the jail's door and into the officer's brown 2012 Chevrolet Equinox SUV. Where the 23-year-old, who was set to be sentenced in May, is now is anybody's guess. The Equinox was discovered around 8:30 a.m. (9:30 a.m. ET) in Kankakee, but without any sign of the convicted murderer who drove it. Looking for Taylor is job No. 1 for authorities. No. 2 is figuring out how he managed to first get out of his cell, then get out of the Jerome Combs Detention Center and on the lam. ""The question for us is where did (the county correctional system) break down,"" Bukowski said. ""It looks right now (like) somebody didn't do their job properly."" What authorities do know is based on video, other evidence and interviews with witnesses -- namely other inmates at the Kankakee jail. What they don't know is how Taylor got out of his two-man cell, when he should have been locked down. But somehow he did, and hid. ""And then when the opportunity arose, he attacked the officer,"" Bukowski said, noting that Taylor ""attacked from the side"" around 3 a.m. ""Beat him, choked him."" He then apparently disrobed the guard, a military veteran and 10-year employee of the corrections department. The guard was left on the jail floor, going in and out of consciousness, for about 35 minutes before authorities -- concerned because the guard hadn't responded to calls -- found him, the sheriff said. ""They then called the ambulance and we were notified and put out an alert,"" added Bukowski. By then, Taylor was gone. He'd pushed a button to notify ""master control"" that he wanted to leave, which means his identity would have been checked by camera. ""We think that because he had the officer's uniform on,"" the sheriff explained, ""that's how he was able to effectively escape."" Taylor walked out the door and into the detention center's parking lot, where, authorities said, he clicked the correctional officer's key fob to find the Chevy Equinox. That officer is now in an intensive care unit at St. Mary's Hospital in Kankakee, Bukowski said. The manhunt, meanwhile, continues for Taylor. He has a history of trouble with the law that predates his murder conviction, including an August 2009 sentence of five years, 10 months in Tennessee for robbery and resisting arrest. Taylor was on parole for that crime when he killed a man during a June 2013 botched robbery. A jury convicted him of murder in that incident in late February. After the verdict was read, Taylor sat down, looked back, then got up and ran, according to The Daily Journal in Kankakee. Bailiffs and sheriff's deputies wrestled him to the ground, eventually leading him out of the courtroom as he cursed. Now a $5,000 reward is being offered for information leading to his arrest. The fact that he tried to get away once before and has been involved in fights ""raises an alert, I guess,"" the Kankakee County sheriff said. ""But we figure that the people who are locked up in our facility aren't altar boys, and we take certain precautions for all of them,"" Bukowski added. ""And you can't become complacent with anybody, especially murderers."" CNN's John Newsome contributed to this report.","Sheriff: The correctional officer is in intensive care after being beaten, choked .

"(CNN)A New York City detective has been suspended after being accused of stealing $3,000 during an illegal cigarettes raid, according to police spokesman Stephen Davis. Surveillance video obtained by CNN affiliate News 12 Brooklyn appears to show Det. Ian Cyrus stashing cash in a bag before leaving the Yemen Deli and Grocery store in Brooklyn last Friday. The detectives had arrested two employees for selling loose cigarettes, according to News 12 Brooklyn. Ali Abdullah, the store's manager, noticed the money was gone from a box, but assumed it was taken by one of his employees. When he checked the cameras he couldn't believe what he saw, he told News 12 Brooklyn. Cyrus, who is under investigation by the internal affairs bureau, could not be reached for comment.

"London (CNN)The Hatton Garden heist, as it will surely come to be known, was every safe deposit box holder's nightmare, every movie director's dream. Thieves using heavy cutting equipment and rappelling gear broke into the vault of an esteemed 60-year-old safe deposit company in the heart of London over the past holiday weekend, possibly taking advantage of as many as four days to rifle through an uncounted number of safe deposit boxes. And they reportedly got away with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of gems and cash -- even, in the educated guess of one former police official, as much as 200 million pounds, or $300 million. Police were offering few details Wednesday of the robbery at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. Detectives on the scene were carrying out a ""slow and painstaking"" forensic examination, police said in a statement. ""Officers anticipate the process to take approximately two days,"" the statement said. ""At this stage it is believed that approximately 60-70 safe deposit boxes were opened during the burglary. Officers are working closely with Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd to establish the identities of those affected. Police will be contacting victims directly as and when they are identified."" WATCH: Top five jewelry heists . Throughout the day Wednesday, customers of the business went in and out of the premises, clearly unhappy about not being able to learn whether their boxes were among those ransacked. Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade. The area's promotional website says it is home to ""the largest and most concentrated cluster of jewellery retailers in the UK"" and has been for quite some time. ""History tells us that the old City of London had certain streets -- or quarters -- dedicated to specific types of business,"" the website says. ""The Hatton Garden area has been the epicentre of London's jewellery trade since medieval times. ""Today, it maintains its international reputation as the centre of London's diamond trade. It is one of the finest and most renowned jewellery locations in the world."" $4.8M in gold swiped from N.C. highway. But how? The police statement did not put a value on the amount of the haul. But numerous British news organizations put the figure in the hundreds of thousands of pounds, which translates into even more hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many of those who rent safe deposit boxes at the company are reportedly in the jewelry trade. But Roy Ramm, a former chief of the Flying Squad, an economic crime unit of London's Metropolitan Police Service, came up with a much higher guess. ""I would not be surprised, given where this one is, in Hatton Garden, if 200 million pounds is around about the amount stolen,"" Ramm said on BBC Radio 4. Because of the long Easter weekend, police did not hear of the robbery until Tuesday morning. This may prove to be an embarrassment, as the Telegraph newspaper reported that the alarm at the business sounded Friday but, as the front and back doors still appeared locked, no action was taken. The website of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. says the company was founded in 1954 and offers a ""secure and cost-effective solution to store and protect important and irreplaceable personal belongings.""

"(CNN)As we approach April 27 when South Africa marks the anniversary of the first post-apartheid elections held that day in 1994, we are faced with yet another wave of deadly attacks against African migrants. Outrage triggered by this violence is being heard loudly throughout social media with ""#WeAreAfrica"" showcasing the need for a common front against this affront. These recurring attacks against migrants and their property might be read as one more indication of how the rainbow nation's dream has faltered. That vision not only symbolized a multi-ethnic South Africa, but one where living in dignity is shared across racial and class lines. Attacks against newcomers in South Africa are often reduced to attitudes of hate and resentment towards other black Africans. The national and international headlines use ""xenophobia"" as if any one word can convey the multifaceted crisis within which this phenomenon occurs. Labeling this turmoil as xenophobic fails to convey the conditions in which African migrants are scapegoated for the persistent legacy of apartheid in the post-liberation era. This word also does not tell us that extreme poverty now exceeds that experienced under apartheid. And it certainly does not account for how extreme inequality is now fully embraced and normalized by a new black elite joining the ""white-haves"" of yesteryear. The question of why foreign blacks are targeted and not foreign whites is also repeated ad nauseam, as if the majority of black citizens and African migrants share any common spaces and experiences with white South Africans or white foreigners. Contact between the majority of African migrant groups and native black South Africans mostly occurs in under-developed informal settlements and townships. In the interaction and competition between these groups in these spaces, we need to be wary of the simplistic treatment of South Africa's ailment as xenophobia. Such labeling does not and cannot explain the totality of the contact, competition and conflict between native poor black South Africans and foreign African entrepreneurs. Attention as to how such interactions occur in an environment where a vast portion of South Africa's black majority experiences segregation, persistent and relative poverty, and high crime rates in post-apartheid South Africa is paramount. Neglecting access to social rights, such as water, electricity, education and other services, is tantamount to violence by political leaders against the poor. Condemning and prosecuting those who incite violence is essential to maintaining law and order and protecting those vulnerable because of their nationality. But the evictions, harassment and ultimately brutal killings of foreigners cannot and should not be separated from the daily brutal violence poor South Africans in informal settlements and many townships experience. It cannot and should not be separated from South Africa's status as one of the most unequal societies in the world; it cannot and should not be separated from the fact that South Africa has one of the highest homicide levels in the world. A mantra of xenophobia wishes away the fact that the everyday lives of those in vulnerable positions in this society (the poor, the disabled, women, children, the elderly) are filled with violence similar -- if not worse -- than that facing African foreigners eking out a living in the midst of abject poverty. Labeling South Africa's poor blacks as ungrateful and amnesiac to the history of hospitality other Africans bestowed on their exiles under apartheid does a disservice to both the local poor whose citizenship rights are marginal at best and the resilient migrants in search of asylum and dignity. Such labeling only serves politicians and the elites who are sealed off by barbed wire surrounded by a security industry that outspends and outnumbers South Africa's police force. It allows corruption to persist while the political leaders who are implicated in this violence scapegoat ""criminal youth"" to further fill an overflowing prison industry. Religious and civil society leaders' recent mobilization saying ""not in our name"" in reaction to violence against migrants should be applauded. But religious, civil society and student groups also have an obligation to organize and denounce the inequality and the violence that is the everyday lot of the extremely poor in South Africa. Pervasive misery and corruption in the midst of a nation with so much potential should not be tolerated. Neither a hashtag of outrage #WeAreAfrica nor the expedience of the label ""xenophobia"" can wish away the angst, violence and the impending crisis in South Africa. Migrants' security and dignity is part and parcel of a greater security and dignity for all South Africans, which seem deferred for now.","Xenophobia cannot explain the conflict between native poor black South Africans and foreign African entrepreneurs, says Abdi .
Killings of foreigners cannot be separated from the brutal violence poor South Africans experience, she adds."
"(CNN)Back in 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini famously said he was ""drinking poison"" when he accepted a ceasefire to end the eight-year-old war with Iraq.  The war had helped define Khomeini's regime, the Islamic Republic, which he had founded a year before Saddam Hussein invaded Iran. Khomeini galvanized the nation, both his supporters and growing opponents, to fight against the enemy. He dragged out the war for eight years, despite Saddam's willingness to accept a ceasefire, and thus stabilized the foundations of the Islamic Republic. By the time he ended the war, the economy was in shambles, and there was no sign of his die-hard volunteers. Since then, ""drinking a chalice of poison"" has became part of Iranian political lexicon, and many analysts have asked whether Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Khomeini's successor, would raise the chalice and surrender to demands by the West to end Iran's nuclear program. Like the war, Iran's defiance to halt its controversial nuclear program has defined Khameni's era. He has defied the West in the face of increasing economic pressure. Iran claims that its program is peaceful, but Khamenei's refusal to end uranium enrichment activities -- a process that can lead to making nuclear fuel as well as nuclear bombs -- has landed the country under crippling sanctions. The standoff with the West has stretched longer than the war. The agreement reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, however, marks a new chapter in the history of the country. If Iran can finalize a deal by June with the United States and its P5+1 partners, international investors, including Americans, would be able to invest in Iran for the first time in decades. Iran can develop its gas and oil fields, and the economy can leap forward. Desperate for a deal, whoever I called over the past week inside Iran was glued to their television sets, and tens of thousands poured out on the streets to celebrate the agreement late Thursday night. Iran's economy shrank after sanctions were intensified in 2012 and the value of the Rial, the Iranian currency, plunged to one-third of the U.S. dollar. Inflation soared and the bank accounts of ordinary Iranians were frozen overseas as a result of sanctions. Millions of Iranians are hoping that their lives will improve in the post-deal era. Despite the regime's propaganda that claimed the program enjoys wide support among people, critics inside the country publicly denounced nuclear policies. Ahmad Shirzad, a former member of parliament, denounced the program last year and said it had been ""against national interests."" Another critic, Sadeq Ziba, said in December ""the nuclear program has hurt the country more than the war."" Iranian politicians are divided between moderates -- led by President Hassan Rouhani, who wants to develop the economy -- and hardliners, who view the deal as a threat to the regime's ideology. The majority of people brought Rouhani to power in 2012, hoping that he would ease the sanctions. Many see the negotiations as a diplomatic necessity that would help sideline hardliners too. Yet the Lausanne agreement would not have been possible without the moderates' will and Khamenei's approval. Ayatollah Khamenei is 76. Last year, he underwent a long prostate surgery, which led to rumors that he might be gravely ill. His predecessor ended the war a year before his death. Whether Khamenei is seriously ill or not, many believe that because of his advanced age, he needs to put the country on a straight path before his death. So far, the regime has presented the deal as a win for itself. During 18 months of negotiations, the regime appeared determined not to succumb to Western demands and lose its right to uranium enrichment. The Lausanne agreement allows Iran to spin 5,000 centrifuges and avoid national humiliation. Khamenei can claim that Iran is the winner in the country's decade-long confrontation with the West -- a legacy that he wants to leave behind. He has not drunk the poison yet, not until June, when negotiators aim to iron out the final deal. But perhaps he has raised the chalice.","Iran's first Supreme Leader made a bitter peace with Iraq's Saddam Hussein .

"(CNN)The idea of sustainable development is that raw capitalism is far too powerful for its own good. Global capitalism is a juggernaut, with the world economy now doubling in size every generation.  Yet on a finite Earth, with a billion new people being added every 15 years, that juggernaut is now laying siege to the physical bases of life and the social support systems that make life pleasant and decent.  Sustainable development offers a path out of this growing crisis. The reality is that raw capitalism is the economics of greed.  Unleash greed, the theory goes, and type-A personalities around the world will spend inordinate energy to organize businesses, invent new products, and thereby raise well-being. And in some sense, there's a lot to say for this theory.  After all, the world economy has expanded at least 100-fold since modern industrial capitalism first found its footing in Britain around 1800, and for most of the world, living standards have risen markedly along the way. Yet history has also taught us that the ""Invisible Hand"" of the free market is a little less miraculous than it looks. Instead, untrammeled greed also leads to massive fraud, mega-tax evasion, pervasive bribery, modern slavery, rising inequalities, and environmental destruction. Perhaps most important, it feeds moral blindness.  Too many of the super-rich, whether they are calling for drilling in the Arctic for oil or encouraging the cutting down of the rainforests for tropical hardwoods, simply deny the irreparable damage they are causing to the planet. It¹s no surprise that the Wall Street Journal runs anti-environmental editorials on what feels like a daily basis.  The environment is a nuisance and a hindrance to greed.  And greed rules the moral order at the top of raw capitalism. Novelists, ethicists, activists, unionists, preachers, teachers, and others have long known these facts, but the juggernaut has proved hard to tame. Unleash greed as the supreme economic good, and it is greed that we get as the ultimate moral arbiter. Sustainable development is a doctrine that says: Let us once again place the economy on a true moral foundation and we'll keep greed within bounds, ensuring the economic growth is combined with social fairness and environmental sustainability. The idea of sustainable development is that an economy must satisfy all three principles: economic growth, social fairness and environmental sustainability.  Yes, there can and should be economic growth, especially for today's developing countries.  Human ingenuity and markets can indeed lead us to higher living standards and longer lives for all parts of the world, rich and poor alike.  But these gains should be widely shared and should never be based on the exploitation of those at the bottom of society.  Social inclusion has been widely shown to improve societal progress broadly for all.  And equally important, those gains should be based on true value added, not on the destruction of natural capital, whether through deforestation, climate change, or pollution of air, land, and water. Thus, sustainable development calls for a holistic approach that combines economic, social, and environmental objectives.  This balanced approach is much harder to achieve than the raw capitalism that places the economy above society and the physical Earth.  Yet it recognizes that we are doomed to conflict and even collapse if we fail to promote social equality and environmental sustainability. Just look at the recent news.  Last year was the Earth's hottest year on record, and another year of mega-storms, droughts, floods, and heat waves.  Major parts of the world, from Pakistan and Iran to California and Brazil, are experiencing mega-droughts, and the prospect of catastrophic water scarcity in the future unless something changes.  And even as the world economy grows and millions escape extreme poverty, our societies become more unequal, less trusting, and corrupt.  All over the world, there is unrest on the streets even as our generation is the beneficiary of unprecedented technological knowhow and material progress. In my new book, The Age of Sustainable Development, I¹ve not only analyzed the trends of growing inequality and rising environmental destruction, but have also shown how the concepts of sustainable development can be used to chart a way out of our growing crisis.  It turns out that with goodwill, cooperation, greed kept in check, and technological savvy, we can build a modern global economy that is productive, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable all at the same time. The ongoing revolution of information and communications technology (ICT) is an incredibly powerful enabler of new sustainable technologies.  And doubters about the feasibility of sustainable development should have a look at Scandinavia ¬ Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, as they are the closest on the planet to achieving this Trifecta of prosperity, fairness, and sustainability. Consider the challenge of climate change, for example.  Big Oil and Wall Street executives too often simply deny the science.  Yet a science-based sustainable development perspective shows that not only is human-induced climate change very real and very dangerous, but that it is also solvable at very low cost by switching over the next 30 years to electric vehicles, heat pumps, well-insulated buildings, smart ICT-enabled grid, wind and solar energy, and other low-carbon and energy efficient technologies. If the world takes the time to do its homework and plan for the future, the world can bring the climate crisis under control and still enjoy a growing supply of quality energy services. And, more generally, although the U.S. political system still feeds untrammeled greed by enabling super-rich campaign donors and lobbyists to buy the political class, the American people and much of the rest of the world are coming to recognize the urgency of sustainable development.  That is why governments around the world will adopt Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) this year, on the 70th anniversary of the United Nations. These new SDGs will become markers and guideposts for building a world that combines prosperity, fairness, and environmental sanity -- a world we truly want and need for ourselves and our children.","Jeffrey Sachs: Raw capitalism is the economics of greed .

"(CNN)The United States has gained much from its position as a space-faring nation. Indeed, U.S. access to space has provided incredible benefit to U.S. national security, defense and the economic well-being of the nation. And in order to effectively confront current and future conflicts, combat terrorism and counter the proliferating threats worldwide, our military depends on space-based capabilities, including intelligence, GPS, and communications satellites. Unfortunately, as global threats increase and the need for assured space access accelerates, the U.S. is faced with a troubling reality -- we are far too reliant on Russian technology to meet our national security obligations. How? For a start, we depend on the Atlas V rocket, which carries many of our most important satellites and is powered by the Russian-made RD-180 rocket engine. The fact that we rely on Russia, currently under sanctions for invading a sovereign nation, should reinforce the need for a change in our current course. Assured access to space is an area where the U.S. should not be reliant on nonsecure foreign supply chains, which are subject to disruption, threats, unfavorable contracts and undue leverage against the interests of the U.S. The Ukraine crisis should have served as a wake-up call, highlighting the danger of dependence on Russia to launch national security satellites into space. And the United States should play no part in supporting the defense industry of a country that continues to abrogate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbors. Simply put, it is bad policy to rely on others for critical national security requirements, and worse policy when this reliance supports countries taking action in direct contradiction to U.S. national security interests. Dmitry Rogozin, a Russian Deputy Prime Minister in charge of defense and space industries, has called American taxpayer outlays for the Russian engine ""free money"" that goes directly back into Russia's missile modernization programs. It is high time the U.S. government turn to its existing domestic capability and turn off this flow of funds. Fortunately, there are some signs of progress. Last year, Congress took bipartisan action to phase out reliance on the RD-180 engine by the end of the decade, and to transition to an all-American space launch capability. The defense authorization for fiscal year 2015 included restrictions on the future use of the RD-180 for the Atlas V, authorizing $220 million to begin development of a U.S. alternative. This was a wise move, but it's not enough. There are steps that the United States can take now to ensure our access to space and secure our comparative advantage in space -- and in the world. True, development of a new launch system will take time; there are no overnight answers. However, a combination of existing capabilities and dynamic development of new capabilities by the private sector can serve as a foundation for eliminating any capability gap in the U.S. space program. Indeed, new entrants are coming online using launch vehicle systems fully designed and manufactured in America. The two main launch competitors -- United Launch Alliance and SpaceX -- each have all-American systems, namely ULA's Delta IV family of rockets and SpaceX's Falcon 9. Having both options will put America on the path to fielding its indigenous space capabilities for the next generation, while strengthening a space industrial base weakened since the end of the Cold War. The short-term goal should be to transition to existing American-manufactured launch vehicles, as opposed to phasing out systems such as the Delta IV, which continue to provide critical capability. In the long term, next-generation development programs should not involve major Russian subsystems and components. It is time to end America's reliance on Russia's rocket engine. This would be good for national security, good for American innovation and the industrial base -- and good for our country's future.","Mike Rogers, Ellen Tauscher: Access to space has benefited U.S. national security .

"(CNN)On the eve of the one-year mark since nearly 300 schoolgirls were abducted by Boko Haram in Nigeria, Malala Yousafzai released an ""open letter"" to the girls Monday. ""Like you, I was a target of militants who did not want girls to go to school,"" she writes in the letter.  The 17-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner survived an attack by the Taliban, which had singled her out for blogging from Pakistan about the importance of staying in school. In the letter, she calls on the Nigerian government and the international community to do more to rescue the girls.  Nigeria recently held an election. On April 14, 2014, Islamists with Boko Haram kidnapped the girls, prompting an international campaign for their safe return, which used the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls.  On Monday, UNICEF announced a new campaign for the 800,000 children who have been displaced in northeast Nigeria, using the hashtag #BringBackOurChildhood. Malala is admired globally as a figure standing for peace.  On Sunday, a NASA astrophysicist named an asteroid after her. She has spoken with CNN about the Nigerian abductions previously. Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid . Here is the full letter: . To my brave sisters, the kidnapped schoolgirls of Chibok, . On this first anniversary of your captivity, I write to you with a message of solidarity, love and hope. My name is Malala. I am a Pakistani girl your age. I am one of the millions of people around the world who keep you and your families foremost in our thoughts and prayers. We cannot imagine the full extent of the horrors you have endured. But please know this: We will never forget you. We will always stand with you. Today and every day, we call on the Nigerian authorities and the international community to do more to bring you home. We will not rest until you have been reunited with your families. Like you, I was a target of militants who did not want girls to go to school. Gunmen shot me and two of my friends on a school bus. All three of us survived and are back in school. Now we speak out on behalf of all girls about the right to get a proper education. Our campaign will continue until you and all girls and boys around the world are able to access a free, safe and quality secondary education. Last July, I spent my 17th birthday in Nigeria with some of your parents and five of your classmates who escaped the kidnapping. Your parents are grief-stricken. They love you, and they miss you. My father and I wept and prayed with your parents -- and they touched our hearts. The escapee schoolgirls my father and I met impressed us with their resolve to overcome their challenges and to complete their high school education. My father and I promised your parents and the girls who had escaped that we would do all we could to help them. I met Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and urged him to work harder for your freedom. I also asked President Jonathan to meet your parents and the girls who escaped the kidnapping, which he did a few days later. Still, in my opinion, Nigerian leaders and the international community have not done enough to help you. They must do much more to help secure your release. I am among many people pressuring them to make sure you are freed. There are reasons for hope and optimism. Nigerian forces are re-gaining territory and protecting more schools. Nigeria's newly-elected president, Muhammadu Buhari, has vowed to make securing your freedom a top priority and promised his government will not tolerate violence against women and girls. ""You will have the opportunity to receive the education you want and deserve. The Malala Fund and other organizations offered all your classmates who escaped the kidnapping full scholarships to complete their secondary education. Most of the escapee girls accepted this scholarship and are now continuing their studies at a safe boarding school and with the support they need. We hope to someday extend that same scholarship to all 219 of you, when you return home. Remember that one day your tragic ordeal will end, you will be reunited with your families and friends, and you will have the chance to finish the education you courageously sought. I look forward to the day I can hug each one of you, pray with you, and celebrate your freedom with your families. Until then, stay strong, and never lose hope. You are my heroes. Your sister, .

"Johannesburg (CNN)South African troops deployed Tuesday evening as part of a new government effort to stop deadly anti-immigrant violence. Their first target: the Johannesburg suburb of Jeppestown, where xenophobic violence broke out on Friday. South African police raided a Jeppestown hostel Tuesday while troops secured the perimeter. Earlier, Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula announced the plan to deploy an undisclosed number of troops to areas where police are spread too thin while trying to curb deadly attacks against immigrants. ""This intervention is not an indictment on the police. ... We are coming in because they need that support,"" she said after visiting Johannesburg's Alexandra township, one area where mobs have attacked immigrants from other African nations and looted their shops -- ostensibly based on the belief that immigrants are taking South Africans' jobs. Seven people have been killed in recent violence against poorer immigrants, many from South Africa's neighbors. Xenophobic killing caught by photographer . Much of this month's violence happened in the port city of Durban, where at least two foreigners and three South Africans were killed after mobs with machetes attacked immigrant shops. Thousands of people took temporary shelter at refugee centers or police stations as a result, according to aid group Gift of the Givers. Similar violence happened late last week in Johannesburg, where immigrant-owned shops were looted or destroyed. The attacks came as residents accused immigrants of taking their jobs and committing crimes. The unemployment rate in South Africa is 25%, according to government figures. The United Nations said the attacks began in March after a labor dispute between citizens and foreign workers. What's behind the xenophobic attacks in South Africa?

"(CNN)Eight Iranian border guards have been killed in clashes with militants near the border with Pakistan, Iranian state media reported. Three of the militants were killed by Iranian forces in the fighting Monday in the southeastern town of Negur, the state-run news agency IRNA reported. The news agency cited Ali Asghar Mirshekari, the deputy governor of Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan province, who said the militants crossed into the country from Pakistan. Iranian officials have reportedly asked Pakistani authorities to catch the surviving assailants. A militant group called Jaish al Adal claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Iranian state media and a Twitter account believed to be associated with the organization. According to Pakistani media, Jaish al Adal is an anti-Iranian group that has emerged during recent years in areas of Balochistan, the restive Pakistani province that borders southeastern Iran. The Sunni Muslim group has targeted Shiites and says it aims to thwart Iranian influence in Pakistan, according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. Jaish al Adal has also claimed responsibility for attacks on Iranian territory. One of the deadliest was in October 2013, when 14 Iranian border guards were killed near the city of Saravan. Iranian authorities say that after similar attacks, the militants have fled back into Balochistan. ""Iran has repeatedly criticized its eastern neighbor for failing to rein in the terrorists,"" IRNA said, referring to Pakistan. The Pakistani government condemned Monday's attack, calling it an ""act of terrorism."" ""The concerned security agencies of Pakistan are actively investigating this incident, which took place on Iran's territory, and have asked Iranian authorities to share with us any evidence that they have,"" the government said in a statement Wednesday. If the militants entered Pakistan after the attack, ""they will be apprehended and brought to justice,"" it said.","The Pakistani government says its security agencies are investigating .

"(CNN)The ""Star Wars"" universe keeps on expanding. Details of the plot for 2016's ""Star Wars: Rogue One"" were revealed during a panel at Star Wars Celebration fan festival Sunday in Anaheim, California. Director Gareth Edwards (""Godzilla"") showed an early teaser for the movie and revealed plot details for the ""Star Wars"" anthology film (the term Disney prefers instead of ""spinoff""), starring Felicity Jones. The movie will take place in between ""Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" and ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" (known to many as the first ""Star Wars"" movie from 1977). A group of rebels go on a rogue mission to steal plans for the Death Star. Jones will play a rebel soldier. The movie won't begin shooting until this summer so the footage shown in the teaser -- including a glimpse of the Death Star -- won't necessarily appear in the finished product. Edwards told the crowd that Jones is a ""Star Wars"" fan and dropped everything to take on the lead role. Producer Kathleen Kennedy said ""Rogue One"" was one of the first pitches she received after becoming president of Lucasfilm in 2012, and she could not turn it down. It was one of the final events at Celebration, where fans gather to talk about ""Star Wars,"" dress in costumes, look for rare ""Star Wars"" merchandise and learn about future projects for the franchise. The convention kicked off with the well-received trailer for this year's ""The Force Awakens."" Costumes and props from that movie also were on display. Anything bearing the movie logo was a hot item for collectors. Tens of thousands are expected to have attended the event when all is said and done.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN)There is a Persian proverb that says: ""A good year is determined by its spring."" For many Iranians, the historic decision by Tehran and six world powers -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China -- to continue nuclear negotiations under a ""joint comprehensive plan of action"" is an indication that this year's Norouz, the Persian New Year that started on March 21, will be a superb one indeed. Although edgy hardliners may now try to play games and complain the preliminary agreement is not what they had hoped, for many people it shows excellent progress and that's what they want. It paves the way for a much broader deal by end of June that guarantees the peaceful nature of Tehran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions and a return to the international community. As is, the stakes are high and the choice is clear for President Hassan Rouhani and his ""moderate"" administration. They must now be over the moon: In early 2016, there will be Legislative and Assembly of Experts elections, the latter of which elects the country's leader. This historic agreement will make sure they win both the elections. So far, Rouhani's team has done nothing to improve the living conditions of ordinary Iranians who complain they have lost half of their purchasing power in recent years. READ MORE: Will Iran's Supreme Leader drink 'poison' of peace? During his presidential campaign, he promised to do so ""only"" if he could seal a nuclear deal with the world powers. And now he has. A full deal ultimately represents a referendum on the Rouhani administration's foreign policy. It will definitely strengthen his hand, which he needs to stay in the game, or better yet, win the next presidential race. The good news is that people are more than happy to welcome the preliminary agreement. They had always wanted a way out of the current impasse with the rest of the world and as a reward they could keep the moderates in power for the foreseeable future. Iranians blame sanctions and the previous hardline government for the sorry state of affairs in the economy -- especially the way they so poorly handled past nuclear talks of the past -- with devastating consequences. Many believe that now there is a joint comprehensive plan of action -- the culmination of a 12-year process -- there is something to hope for. In many respects, it's a new beginning and that allows Iranians a very small degree of hope inside themselves too. Looking back, the previous government traded those expectations for international isolation and economic hardship. Despite skepticism, even the country's leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, now feels that the light at the end of the tunnel might not be a train and that the talks could end well.

Little wonder he had urged the nation -- including the well-funded hardliners -- to support the government's overture, saying the negotiating team was trustworthy and had been doing a fine job. It was a historic gesture that represents qualified support for continued diplomacy and that could lead to a historic step forward. It places confidence and hope in the negotiating team and the P5+1 group of world powers, guaranteeing no-one in Iran will stand in the way of principled diplomatic engagement and international rapprochement. Within this context, many Iranians are jubilant. They should be. More than ever, they are confident that not striking a comprehensive deal would be a historic mistake. They are confident it is within reach and this is as it should be: A win-win deal for all. They now strongly believe the lifting of international sanctions is no longer illusive. It would resuscitate the country's ailing economy and improve their lives. At least, that's what they hope. It's early spring and people on the streets are talking about nothing but the current choice. It represents the biggest chance of rapprochement between Tehran and Washington since the Iranian revolution in 1979. After all, for many Iranians this is more than just a nuclear agreement.","Deal between Iran and six world powers has given Iranians hope, writes Ghanbar Naderi .

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) [Breaking news update at 11:45 p.m. ET] . Two African-Americans -- Ella Jones and Wesley Bell -- were elected to the Ferguson City Council on Tuesday, meaning three of the six council members are black. [Previous story, published at 6:52 p.m. ET] . The skies grew ominous and the radio crackled with warnings of flash floods. Amid the rain, Ferguson opened its polls at 6 a.m. for municipal elections that traditionally have drawn very few out to vote. But today was different. This was the first city election since white police Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown last August. Since then, this St. Louis suburb of 21,000 people has gone through epic upheaval with revelations of systemic discrimination against African-Americans by law enforcement and the courts. There's widespread feeling, especially in the African-American community, that if the turnout is low, then all the protests, the investigations, the calls for change will have been in vain. St. Louis elections officials said they had no indication that turnout in Tuesday's election would be any different than other years. But among the candidates inspired to run by the events that transpired here, there was hope of seeing greater voter participation. ""That is what our democracy is about,"" said Wesley Bell, a 40-year-old lawyer and criminal justice professor who also is a part-time municipal judge in nearby Velda City. Bell is running against Lee Smith, a retired electrical plant employee, in Ward 3. That area includes Canfield Drive, where Brown was killed, and the West Florissant Avenue business corridor that felt the brunt of the protests and the vandalism. Charred, heavily damaged buildings stand as scars of Ferguson's despair and anger. Both Bell and Smith are black, And no matter the outcome, one of them will double the African-American representation on the council. Even though 70% of Ferguson's 21,000 people are black, five of the six current City Council members and the mayor are white. The council was cited along with the Ferguson Police Department, which has three black officers, as a symbol of white power in a majority black city. ""We have to get out of this law enforcement for business,"" said candidate Doyle McClellan, coordinator of the computer network security program at Lewis and Clark Community College. McClellan referred to the scathing report by the U.S. Department of Justice that found Ferguson issued fines and traffic tickets to generate revenue for the city. ""That's not a good thing,"" McClellan said as he stood in the drizzle at a polling station, hoping to persuade voters who were still undecided. The polls close here at 7 p.m. Results are not expected until a few hours later. Ted Heidemann, a 67-year-old retired airline pilot, said he voted for Brian Fletcher, a former mayor who launched the ""I Love Ferguson"" campaign last fall to raise money for mom and pop businesses that were hurt by the looting and vandalism. Some residents see Fletcher as being a part of the establishment, part of the problem. But Heidemann asked why no one complained when Fletcher was mayor. He said Brown's shooting brought a lot of bad things to light. ""We didn't realize the effect some of the institutional problems had on poor people,"" he said. ""Some things need to be changed and we are aware of that."" By midafternoon, Fletcher said the numbers looked good. At a church where voters from all three wards were casting ballots, he predicted a 40-50% turnout. When the rain let up for a few minutes, a stream of voters trickled into the First Presbyterian Church in downtown Ferguson to cast their votes. Ellory and Kathy Glenn both voted for Bob Hudgins, a political novice who attracted attention as a white man who routinely stood with protesters on the front lines. He speaks often of having married a black woman and having a biracial teenage son. ""I wanted change,"" said Ellory Glenn, 60, who is black. His wife is white. He said the couple moved to Ferguson after he retired from the Marine Corps in 1995 because they felt it was a racially welcoming place. But now, after all the problems rose to the surface, it's time for fresh blood on the City Council, Glenn said. That's why they chose Hudgins over Fletcher. ""Quit using law enforcement as a revenue stream,"" he said. ""That's like using the military to go into places and looting them. The police are supposed to keep order."" Angela Jackson came to the polls with her husband and two little girls in tow. She voted for Ella Jones, a former Mary Kay cosmetics sales director who resigned her job in January to run for office. Jackson echoed the thoughts of other Ferguson residents who experienced something new in this election: candidates coming to their door. Past elections have not seen the kind of canvassing activity that took place in the last few weeks. ""One thing we really liked is (Jones) came to our door and talked to us about her desire to make change in our neighborhood,"" Jackson said. ""She's going to be hands on. She lives in the neighborhood as well, and has for the past 36 years. We were kind of taken by that."" Fletcher, the former mayor turned City Council candidate, campaigned that Ferguson would benefit from his experience more than a newcomer, saying his contacts from almost three decades in politics would be an invaluable asset in getting Ferguson back on its feet. ""I understand that feeling,"" Fletcher said of those who feel he's too entrenched in the city's old guard, ""but those individuals don't know me."" The city is required to approve a new budget by the end of June and the new council will have to look for alternative sources of revenue to replace the $3 million or so lost from money generated by traffic tickets and fines. ""That amount will drop significantly,"" Fletcher said. The rain began to fall again as the Glenns got in their car. It was expected to continue off and on through the day and night. But about 5, just when many voters were leaving work, the sun shone brilliantly. Overheard at one precinct: Good weather brought out the worst in Ferguson last August. Maybe today, it would bring out the best.","Two more African-Americans have been elected to the Ferguson City Council .

One victim, identified by police as Shalom Yohai Cherki, 26, died at the hospital. A 20-year-old woman remains in serious condition, according to Rosenfeld. The driver has been arrested and is under investigation by the General Security Services. ""From the investigation and first findings, there is a strong suspicion that we're talking about a terror attack,"" Rosenfeld said. Amid the ongoing investigation, a magistrate court has issued a gag order on details of the incident.","Incident occurred Wednesday night near Hebrew University in Jerusalem, police say .

"Hong Kong (CNN)An impressive art collection assembled by the late actress and Hollywood icon, Lauren Bacall, has officially been offered for purchase. The collection, which includes works by some of the greatest artists of the 20th century, went under the hammer in New York on March 31, following a tour of Hong Kong, Paris, London and Los Angeles. Bacall, who died in August 2014 at the age of 89, first shot to international fame in 1944 with her first film, ""To Have And Have Not."" That was also when the husky-voiced starlet met her future husband, Humphrey Bogart. At the recent 2015 Golden Globes, George Clooney paid tribute to the silver screen queen in his award winning speech. ""I don't remember what awards Lauren Bacall won, I just remember her saying: 'You know how to whistle, don't you Steve. You just put your lips together and blow.'"" said Clooney, referring to one of her most legendary lines from her first movie. The 750-piece collection, which fetched a total of $3.64 million, featured bronze sculptures, jewelry, and a number of decorative arts and paintings, which were sold at Bonhams auction house in New York. ""Her collection is truly a reflection of her extraordinary taste and remarkable life,"" said Jon King, Bonhams' vice president. Among the 50 items highlighted in the auction preview were six bronze maquettes by Henry Moore, Britain's greatest 20th century sculptor and one of Bacall's favorite artists, whom she developed a close relationship with. One of them sold for close to $120,000. Also for sale were some of Bacall's most loved jewelry pieces, created by legendary French designer Jean Schlumberger, most known for his work at Tiffany & Co. A rose diamond camel brooch by British jeweler Elizabeth Gage fetched $23,750 and was accompanied by the original drawing and correspondence from the designer, which shows the close-knit relationship Bacall had with Gage. The wide-ranging collection was expected to appeal to a variety of collectors: fine arts and antiques dealers, fans of Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, as well as memorabilia enthusiasts. Most of the items auctioned come from the apartment in New York's Dakota Building that she shared with her second husband, actor Jason Robards, until 1969. But King said fans of Humphrey Bogart would have been pleased to know some of the items were also from their shared residence in Los Angeles. King, who got to know Bacall in her late years, said the collection reflects the actress' eclectic taste, and there was only one principle she applied to collecting: . ""Everything had to kind of speak to her, to catch her eye. She loved form, she loved texture, she loved color. And she loved mixing it all up. She said that when you walked into her house, what she liked was that it was never boring,"" King said. ""You could walk into the same room a hundred times, and see something new every time.""","A collection of 750 items belonging to legendary actress Lauren Bacall has been auctioned off at Bonhams in New York .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN)The question haunting Kiev is this: Who might be murdering allies of Ukraine's ousted President Viktor Yanukovych? The idea that this might be happening is not entirely new. But it muscled its way to the fore again this week with two high-profile shooting deaths in the Ukrainian capital -- one of a former member of parliament with ties to Yanukovych, the other of a Ukrainian journalist known for his pro-Russian views. Oleg Kalashnikov, the former member of parliament, was shot and killed shortly after 7 p.m. Wednesday at the entrance to his apartment block. Kalashnikov, 52, was a member of the Party of Regions, the former ruling party in Ukraine, and was close to Yanukovych. Police are investigating the death as a murder. A day later, on Thursday, journalist Oles Buzyna, 45, was killed near his home by shots fired from a dark blue Ford Focus, Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. The car's license plates were reported to have been from either Latvia or Belorussia. The killings renewed speculation, sparked by earlier unusual deaths, about a conspiracy to kill people close to Yanukovych. At least three former members of parliament with the Party of Regions have reportedly committed suicide in the last seven weeks: . • On February 28, Mikhail Chechetov reportedly jumped from the window of his 17th-floor apartment in Kiev, having left a suicide note. He was suspected of having falsified the results of a parliamentary vote in early 2014 that essentially prohibited protest just as thousands of people were protesting against the Yanukovych government. • On March 9, Stanislav Melnik, a former member of parliament with the Party of Regions and the manager of several businesses in the separatist-minded eastern city of Donetsk, was found dead in his apartment near Kiev. He, too, reportedly left a suicide note. • And three days later, on March 12, Oleksandr Peklushenko, another former member of parliament, was found in his house in Zaporizhzhya, in southeastern Ukraine, dead of a gunshot wound. Police are investigating various scenarios, including suicide. Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said Peklushenko ""might have wanted to avoid punishment for using violence against protesters, which he was suspected of."" Ukraine is deeply divided, and it has been for years. About a third of the population speaks Russian as opposed to Ukrainian. Whether the country should be drawn into the orbit of Russia or the West is a visceral issue, a question for many Ukrainians not of politics but of identity. Recent events have deepened the divide. In 2014, after Yanukovych turned his back on the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia, he was driven from office by mass demonstrations. And with Russia's subsequent annexation of Crimea and its support for Russian-speaking separatists in eastern Ukraine, the internecine animosity made the ugly transformation into war. With a government toppled and armed conflict in the east, Ukrainians have reason to want each other dead. But the view of who might be responsible for the series of deaths differs starkly, according to which side of the country's divide one is on. The Opposition Bloc, the country's major opposition party, has no doubt the deaths have been politically motivated -- ""bloody terror against opposition politicians and journalists,"" the bloc's media office called them. ""It is clear oppression of those who are not afraid to criticize the government,"" it said. The government, unsurprisingly, sees things differently. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who came to office after Yanukovych was ousted, has demanded an investigation of the killings of Kalashnikov and Buzyna, his media office said. ""It is evident that these crimes have the same origin,"" the media office quoted Poroshenko as saying. ""Their nature and political sense are clear. It is a deliberate provocation that plays in favor of our enemies. It is aimed at destabilizing the internal political situation in Ukraine and discrediting the political choice of the Ukrainian people."" And Anton Geraschenko, an adviser to the country's interior minister, took the theory one step further. ""It should not be excluded that the killings of Oleg Kalashnikov and Olez Buzyna were planned and organized from Moscow and are a part of a plan to destabilize Ukraine and further support anti-Ukrainian mood in Russian society,"" Geraschenko said.","Five recent deaths heighten suspicions on both side of Ukraine's ethnic divide .
Ukraine's President orders an investigation of the recent killings .
The opposition calls the killings ""oppression,"" but the government says Moscow may be to blame ."
"(CNN)Civil unions between people of the same sex will soon be recognized in Chile. The country joined several of its South American neighbors in allowing the unions when President Michelle Bachelet enacted a new law on Monday. ""This is a concrete step in the drive to end the difference between homosexual and heterosexual couples,"" Bachelet said. The new law will take effect in six months. It will give legal weight to cohabiting relationships between two people of the same sex and between a man and a woman. The Chilean government estimates that around 2 million people will be able to benefit from the change. The law is intended to end discrimination faced by common-law couples, such as not being allowed to visit partners in hospital, make medical decisions on their behalf or decide what to do with their remains. It also gives the couples greater rights in the realms of property, health care, pensions and inheritance. A number of South American nations have moved to allow same-sex civil unions in recent years. But marriage between people of the same sex is legal only in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.","President Michelle Bachelet signs law that will take effect in six months .

"(CNN)The next time you fly to see Grandma in Florida, look down. The next time you take the kids on a pilgrimage to see the talking mouse or head down to South Beach for some sun/sin, get a window seat and spend the moments before landing contemplating the seemingly endless swamp below. Because there are few places that represent the folly of man -- and the cost of redemption -- like the Everglades. On approach into Miami or Orlando, it just looks like squishy wasteland full of things that want to hurt you: snakes and scorpions, rats and roaches, gators and mosquitoes. (A researcher once caught 365,000 bloodthirsty bugs in a single trap in a single night.) As you drive along the Tamiami Trail, it just looks like endless sawgrass, the kind that feels like walking through broken glass. ""Too wet to farm, too dry to sail, too unpredictable to settle,"" as Michael Grunwald put it in his definitive history, ""The Swamp."" And so, a century ago, some American dreamers decided to drain the swamp. They decided to conquer that uninhabitable frontier known as Florida. And long before air conditioning, bug spray and Social Security helped seal that vision, the Army Corps of Engineers blasted and dug 2,000 miles of dams and dikes, ditches and pipes. They did a hell of a job. A watershed built for 2 million people now supports nearly 8 million, and another 50 million tourists each year. But what they didn't know is that without this swamp, there can be no ""good life"" in Florida. There can be no life. After a century of development, half the Everglades is dead and the other half is on life support. This is a problem, not just for the gators and snakes. It is a problem for the eagles, panthers, snails, dolphins, hawks, manatees, flamingos, vase sponges, black bears and ghost orchids that make up the most unique, diverse wetlands in the world. And most of all, it is a problem for people. Because most of the drinking water in South Florida comes from the aquifers beneath the Everglades. This 2 million-acre river of grass is not only the best form of hurricane protection, it also supports the multibillion-dollar fishing, shrimping and crabbing industries around the Florida Keys. What was once a slow-moving river of gin-clear water became so sluggish and toxic in the 1990s that most of the life in Florida Bay was wiped out -- and America woke up. Fifteen years after then-Gov. Jeb Bush smiled as Bill Clinton signed the most ambitious wildlife reclamation plan in history, the same Army Corps of Engineers that was ordered to rip the Everglades apart is now under orders to help it heal, to the tune of $13 billion as part of a larger congressional restoration plan. That story hook is what drew me here for the final episode of our first season of ""The Wonder List."" To be honest, as a veteran of a few ho-hum airboat rides, I came with really low expectations. But this place, more than any other this season, surprised me with sublime beauty, great stories and a sense of real urgency as good people try to right the wrongs of the past. Nowhere else is the border between bustling civilization and untamed wilderness so narrow, which is why conservationists like to say that the Everglades is a test. If we pass, we might just get to keep the planet.","The Everglades were drained a century ago and are now being restored .

"(CNN)They took Yarmouk by storm, a sea of masked men flooding into the streets of one the world's most beleaguered places. Besieged and bombed by Syrian forces for more than two years, the desperate residents of this Palestinian refugee camp near Damascus awoke in early April to a new, even more terrifying reality -- ISIS militants seizing Yarmouk after defeating several militia groups operating in the area. ""They slaughtered them in the streets,"" one Yarmouk resident, who asked not to be named, told CNN. ""They (caught) three people and killed them in the street, in front of people. The Islamic State is now in control of almost all the camp."" An estimated 18,000 refugees are now trapped inside Yarmouk, stuck between ISIS and Syrian regime forces in ""the deepest circle of hell,"" in the words of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Yarmouk, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria, was formed in 1957 to accommodate people fleeing the Arab-Israeli conflict. The camp, which sits just 6 miles from central Damascus, has been engulfed in fighting between the Syrian government and armed groups since December 2012. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front control about 90% of the camp. The organization also claims that the Syrian government has dropped barrel bombs on the camp in an effort to drive out armed groups. Activists and residents in Yarmouk tell CNN that as many as 5,000 people have tried to flee their homes since ISIS stormed the camp, but have no place to go. Hundreds have been injured, but the camp's only functioning hospital was first occupied by ISIS, then targeted last week by regime shelling. As the fighting raged in Yarmouk, the director of the Jafra Foundation -- the only aid group that has been able to get into the camp -- painted a grim portrait of the conditions on the ground since ISIS arrived. ""We need medicine and access to treatment and medical facilities,"" Wesam Sabaneh told CNN. ""The last hospital in Yarmouk camp was bombed yesterday, so there's really nothing functioning."" Opinion: Save the 'miracle babies' Even delivering clean water in Yarmouk can be a deadly task. Majed Alomari, the Jafra Foundation's water coordinator, was killed a few days ago -- gunned down in an ISIS firefight with rival rebel groups. The head of the Palestinian League for Human Rights in Syria (PLHR), who fled the camp and Syria in October 2012, said the people of Yarmouk were in dire need of help. ""According to my contacts inside, people are back to consuming water with spices -- a common meal used in 2014"" during the Syrian regime's siege of the camp, the PLHR's Salim Salamah told CNN. Aid agencies briefly managed to break the government's stranglehold on the camp last year, and delivered aid to tens of thousands. But now, as terror closes in on Yarmouk from all sides, residents have two choices -- to attempt to flee what was their place of refuge, or to stay inside what the U.N. says now resembles a camp of death. ""Now I am scared of two things -- I am scared of (ISIS) and the regime,"" the Yarmouk resident told CNN. ""The regime now is about to destroy the Yarmouk camp,"" he said. ""And ISIS, I don't know ... they didn't do anything except [rename] Yarmouk Camp as 'Yarmouk Islamic State.'""","ISIS has seized control of large parts of the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in Syria .

"(CNN)China's cybercensors have long used a ""Great Firewall"" to block its citizens from reading critical articles from Western news websites or consuming other content it disapproves of. But it's no longer enough for them, says a study published Friday. They've developed a new IT weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders, including in the United States. The study's authors have named it the ""Great Cannon,"" and it operates in plain sight. Going on the attack so visibly and handily within another country's borders will probably draw international ire, the study's authors say, and Beijing may have counted on that. ""This is a powerful attack capability, and we are curious about the risk and benefit analysis that led the Chinese government to reveal it with this highly visible denial of service attack,"" said researcher John Scott-Railton. The reason Chinese censors are taking that risk: Free-speech cyberactivists have found ways to get around the Great Firewall and give Chinese readers greater access to the West's free press. Enter the ""Great Cannon."" It blasts targeted Web servers with massive distributed denial of service attacks, and it uses the Web browsers of unsuspecting Web surfers to do it. The Cannon wrecked two online services with DDoS attacks in March, say the researchers from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, the International Computer Science Institute, the University of California-Berkeley and Princeton University. Many of the researchers focus on the abuse of information technology to undermine civil liberties and human rights.  And they are afraid this new cyberweapon could easily be used for an array of powerful attacks beyond what they've already observed. ""A modest technical change could turn the Great Cannon into a malware delivery device for infecting the computer of a target individual anywhere in the world who visits a Chinese server,"" Scott-Railton said. This might include all emails headed in and out of China, he said. ""The device could replace genuine attachments with malicious files, for example."" One of the Great Cannon's targets that the researchers studied was an obvious one -- Greatfire.org, run by Chinese expats bent on fighting Beijing's censorship. They monitor Chinese citizens' access to international news sites such as German news service Deutsche Welle or The Tibet Post. But the other target may seem odd at first glance. GitHub is a popular Silicon Valley hosting service used by programmers who want to share code with each other. The two attacks were connected, however, the study says. GreatFire.org hosted two GitHub repositories that contained computer code allowing Chinese readers to get around the Great Firewall and read The New York Times in Chinese. Critical articles from the Times are a particular fly in the ointment for Beijing, and China has turned away at least three of the paper's reporters in short succession, according to a U.S. congressional commission on China. GitHub said it thought the attackers were trying to coerce it into taking content offline. GreatFire.org says it suspects the attack may have been in response to a Wall Street Journal article on its struggle to circumvent Chinese censors. Both services suspected China was behind their attacks and used the Great Firewall to carry it out, according to statements and media reports. By triggering attacks and analyzing them, the researchers concluded that Beijing has developed a tool distinctly different from the Great Firewall. They are confident it is also in China and say it is technically similar to the Great Firewall. The firewall, in a manner of speaking, stands aside and watches all digital traffic going in and out of China, the researchers say. If it sees requests going out into the world for content it doesn't want citizens to see, the researchers say, it discreetly injects forged messages to the foreign server and the Chinese user's computer to make them stop communicating. The user might see an HTTP 403 reply -- ""Sorry, you're not authorized to see this page."" Not only does the Great Firewall monitor tons of traffic, but its systems have to do a lot of processing to discern what to block and what not, so it's work-intensive. The Great Cannon takes on a much lighter load, because it doesn't care about all that traffic. Instead, it targets traffic between a handful of Web addresses. But it uses Web traffic unrelated to its targets to build its attack against them. Users going to Baidu, one of China's most prolific Web services and most successful Internet companies, can become unknowing proxy warriors against the Great Cannon's targets, the study says. In the overwhelming number of cases, when traffic came into China from the outside world, the Great Cannon let it through to Baidu's advertising servers. But in a tiny fraction of the cases the researchers observed, it picked out computers it wanted to use in the attack, and sent bad code back to the user's browser. ""The malicious script enlisted the requesting user as an unwitting participant in the DDoS attack against GreatFire.org and Github,"" the authors wrote. Their browsers mercilessly fired requests at both sites and paralyzed them. ""At the time of writing they number 2.6 billion requests per hour,"" GreatFire.org wrote during an outage in March. ""Websites are not equipped to handle that kind of volume so they usually 'break' and go offline."" GitHub said the March incident was the biggest DDoS attack in its history. Back then, the programmers noticed that there were unique aspects about the attack. ""These include every vector we've seen in previous attacks as well as some sophisticated new techniques that use the web browsers of unsuspecting, uninvolved people to flood github.com with high levels of traffic,"" they wrote. Baidu denies any involvement in the attacks and says its internal security has remained intact, the researchers said. But government cybercensors' monitoring of traffic to and from Baidu's servers could hurt its reputation as a major player in international commerce. Fully encrypting Web traffic should help to defend against the Great Cannon, Scott-Railton said. Chinese President Xi Jinping is a Communist Party hardliner, and since he took office in November 2012, Chinese citizens have felt the grip tightening again on freedoms they thought they had gained, journalists and activists say. Xi and the Politburo ""are responding to new threats by falling back on repressive tactics"" rather than ""experimenting with more liberal policies,"" think tank Freedom House wrote in an analysis. And repression has particularly targeted grass-roots activists, online opinion leaders and ordinary citizens on the Internet. Xi also has a reputation for eyeing Western values with suspicion and considering American IT companies, such as Intel and Google, partners of the U.S. government. ""Deployment of the GC (Great Cannon) may also reflect a desire to counter what the Chinese government perceives as U.S. hegemony in cyberspace,"" the researchers write. The authors say the United States and Great Britain already have methods for intercepting unencrypted traffic and launching attacks.","China's cybercensors have developed a new IT weapon and have attacked servers outside their borders .

"(CNN)The investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 has not revealed evidence of the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's motive, but he suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Dusseldorf, Germany, said Monday. Investigators have not found any writings or conversations where Lubitz shared his motives or confessed to any plans, prosecutor's spokesman Christoph Kumpa said. However, medical records reveal that Lubitz was suicidal at one time and underwent psychotherapy. This was before he ever got his pilot's license, Kumpa said. Kumpa emphasized there's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash. It is believed that Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane Tuesday into the French Alps, killing all 150 on board. The prosecutor's office confirmed what some media outlets had reported about doctors deeming Lubitz unfit to fly, though there were no physical illnesses found. In short, investigators in Germany and France are not yet ruling anything out. Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind, with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues. Lubitz, 27, passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014, a German aviation source told CNN. He had stated working as a commercial pilot in 2013, Lufthansa said. An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said that the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health. It's unknown if Lubitz mentioned his problems on a form that asks yes-or-no questions about physical and mental illness, suicide attempts and medications. European pilots must fill out the form to be recertified. Federal aviation authorities, not the airline, issue the form. The form is privileged information and Lufthansa never sees a pilot's completed form, said an airline spokesperson. The airline would only get a ""clear to fly"" notice from the aviation doctors alerting the airline that a pilot has completed recertification. Lubitz had visited an eye doctor because of vision problems, a European government official familiar with the investigation told CNN. The pilot complained he was not seeing as he should, but the doctor told him the cause was psychosomatic, the official said. In part because of this, the doctor deemed Lubitz unfit for flying. Lubitz told a different doctor --  a neuropsychologist -- that he was too stressed with work, the European official said. The dates of these visits are unclear, but they could have been earlier this year. The official said he is not aware of any suicidal tendencies reported by Lubitz to the doctors, but that investigators believe he was suicidal. Airline officials have said that if Lubitz went to a doctor on his own, he would have been required to self-report if deemed unfit to fly. A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently on March 10, ""concerning a diagnosis."" But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. The speculation about Lubitz' mental state is based on a letter found in a waste bin in his Dusseldorf apartment. The note, which was ""slashed,"" said Lubitz was not able to do his job, Kumpa said Friday. Britain's most senior psychiatrist, Sir Simon Wessely, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday that when a pilot is ""acutely depressed or suffering from really any physical illness"" that impairs abilities, they cannot fly an aircraft safely. ""We don't let pilots fly with depression ... because they're impaired in concentration, memory and attention, which isn't good for a pilot,"" said Wessely, who is president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and an adviser to the British army. One of the strongest pieces of evidence to emerge from the crash so far comes from the cockpit voice recorder. The sounds recorded on the recorder, known as a ""black box,"" firms up a theory by investigators that the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit and then crashed the plane. ""For God's sake, open the door!"" Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer screamed as he banged on the cockpit door, pleading with the co-pilot. Thirteen minutes later, the plane slammed into the French Alps. The audio from the plane's cockpit voice recorder has not been released, but the German newspaper Bild published Sunday what it claims is a summary of the transcript from the recording. CNN cannot independently verify the information, which Bild says is based on 1.5 hours of audio that was on the cockpit voice recorder. According to Bild's report, Sondenheimer told co-pilot Lubitz that he didn't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff. Lubitz told him he could go anytime. After reaching cruising altitude, Sondenheimer asked Lubitz to prepare the landing. Once that's finished, Lubitz again told the captain he ""can go anytime."" There is the sound of a seat being pushed backward after which the captain says, ""You can take over."" At 10:29 a.m., air traffic radar detects that the plane is starting to descend. Three minutes later, air traffic controllers try to contact the plane and receive no answer -- shortly after which an alarm goes off in the cockpit, warning of the ""sink rate,"" Bild reported. Next comes the banging. Sondenheimer begs Lubitz to let him in. Passengers then begin to scream, according to the transcript obtained by Bild. Another three minutes pass. A loud metallic bang is heard at 7,000 meters (almost 23,000 feet). A minute and half later and 2,000 meters (about 6,500 feet) lower to the ground, an alarm says, ""Terrain -- pull up!"" ""Open the damn door!"" the pilot says. It's 10:38 a.m., and the plane is at 4,000 meters (about 13,000 feet). Lubitz's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder, according to Bild's report. Two minutes later, investigators think they hear the plane's right wing scrape a mountaintop. Screams can be heard one final time. France's accident investigation agency, BEA, told CNN that the agency was ""dismayed"" by the voice recording leak to Bild. Martine Del Bono, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the leak could not have come from a BEA agent. She said the agency considers the report mere ""voyeurism."" Cockpit recordings are some of the most sensitive and closely held parts of aviation crash investigations. They're never officially released, according to CNN aviation reporter Richard Quest. Quest called it ""unbelievable"" that the black box audio would be leaked in this manner. Communications between air traffic control and a plane's cockpit can be downloaded privately, but that's less common in Europe than it is in the United States. An edited and redacted version of the transcript is usually published in part of a final report on an incident. Although search teams have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. That device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight. About 150 German investigators -- some specializing in homicide cases and others in identifying remains -- are in the French Alps at the site of the crash, Dusseldorf police said Monday. Meanwhile, police continue to examine evidence collected from the apartment of Lubitz and from his parents' home, police said. French investigators at the crash site said they are optimistic they will be able to identify most of the passengers but added that ""it may not be possible to find the human remains of all the 150 passengers, as some of them may have been pulverized by the crash."" Of the 150 passengers, 78 had been identified through DNA, Lt. Col.  Jean-Marc Menichini told CNN. Weather conditions slowed the rescue work Monday, Capt. Yves Naffrechoux of the High Mountain Gendarmerie unit said. A new path under construction to the crash site will reduce the time it takes to reach the area, he said. Le Vernet Mayor Francois Balique told CNN the path was within 100 meters of being finished. He commissioned a backhoe to build the path, he said. ""I felt the family members wanted this and they asked me to get them as close as possible, as if every meter mattered to them,"" he said. The path will allow all-terrain vehicles to reach the site with fewer risks than with helicopter transfers. Family members of those aboard Flight 9525, meanwhile, are making the grim pilgrimage to the crash site. A total of 325 people have so far traveled to the site, Germanwings Chief Operating Officer Oliver Wagner said Monday at a news conference. He detailed what the airline is doing to support relatives of the victims. CNN's Pamela Brown, Pamela Boykoff, Antonia Mortensen, Sandrine Amiel, Frederik Pleitgen, Karl Penhaul and Margot Haddad contributed to this report.","European pilots must fill out forms that ask about mental and physical illnesses .

"(CNN)The leader of Yemen's Houthi rebels vowed not to back down on Sunday as a top Saudi military official claimed weeks of airstrikes had significantly weakened the Shiite group. ""Our fighters will not evacuate from the main cities or the government institutions,"" rebel leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said in a televised address. ""Anyone who thinks we will surrender is dreaming."" His comments came after more than three weeks of Saudi-led coalition bombings aimed at pushing back the Houthis, who surged into the capital of Sanaa in January and ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power. Hadi still claims he's Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. Since mid-March, more than 700 people have been killed in violence that shows no sign of slowing, according to figures from the World Health Organization. The Houthis say they have the support of the country's people behind them. ""It's the right of the Yemeni people to stand against the attacks in all possible means as long as the attacks continue,"" Al-Houthi said Sunday. ""After our people move and react against the attacks and killing of children and women, we do not want to hear any voices and cries."" But there are signs of some fracturing among forces loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, many of whom have fought alongside the rebels. Gen. AbdulRahman AlHalili, who leads more than 10,000 troops, has now allied himself with Hadi, military sources said Sunday. Meanwhile, Saudi Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri said Sunday that airstrikes had decimated the Houthis' central command by targeting their communications. The rebels, he said, are now holding a defensive stance in besieged areas. Since it began the campaign known as Operation Decisive Storm on March 26, the Saudi-led coalition has launched 2,300 airstrikes, Asiri said.

"(CNN)Twenty years ago, on April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh detonated a massive truck bomb in front of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.  The attack killed 168 men, women and children, injured hundreds more, and remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history. The attack's aftermath saw a storm of media coverage with themes such as ""attack on the heartland"" and America's ""lost innocence."" In fact, the bombing took the country by surprise. It wasn't simply the scale of the tragedy that drew attention, but the fact that the bombing exposed something new: American citizens targeting their own government with a deadliness hitherto unseen. The public became aware of the true danger of the extreme right.  Reports connected McVeigh and his accomplice Terry Nichols to anti-government ideology movements, such as the militia movement, as well as to white supremacist causes. Law enforcement also played catchup. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's 1994 annual report on terrorism had given short shrift to the extreme right.  Its coverage of domestic terrorism focused on the activities of Puerto Rican radicals and animal rights and environmental extremists. In contrast, the report spent only a paragraph describing the threat from right-wing extremists.  It ignored the rapidly growing militia and sovereign citizen movements, and made no reference to events in Idaho and Texas. In late 1992, at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, a standoff between U.S. Marshals and Randy Weaver's family resulted in the death of a marshal, a young boy and the boy's unarmed mother. And in 1993, federal agents launched an ill-conceived raid on property near Waco, Texas, belonging to the Branch Davidians sect, leading to a bloody shootout and a 51-day standoff, which ended in the death of almost all the Davidians, including a number of children. These incidents infuriated the entire extreme right, which saw them as deliberate attempts by the government to kill American citizens. After Oklahoma City, everything changed. The FBI shifted its priorities, hiring new agents and reassigning staff to work on domestic terrorism cases.  It significantly expanded the number of Joint Terrorism Task Forces and went to Congress with a lengthy ""want"" list. The effort actually paid off.  Increased scrutiny of right-wing extremists resulted in a flurry of arrests for everything from terrorist plots to hate crimes.  Though it had paid a high price to do so, it seemed that the United States had recognized the dangers that right-wing extremists posed. However, just six years after the Oklahoma City bombing, an event occurred that pushed to the background those lessons so dearly won. The September 11, 2001, terror attacks -- attacks of a scale and ferocity that dwarfed even that of the Oklahoma City bombing -- commanded the full attention of the nation.  The government, law enforcement, the news media and the public all rushed to grapple with the issue of Islamic extremism. Unfortunately, rather than expanding national attention to encompass the dangers of both radical Islam and right-wing extremism, the 9/11 attacks simply shifted attention away from the extreme right. Certainly, the 9/11 attacks warranted great attention. They made starkly clear the threat that international radical Islamist groups posed to the United States. Moreover, the surge of right-wing extremism that marked the 1990s had seemingly ebbed. Thus it is no real surprise that concern over right-wing violence faded into the background. The significance of the Oklahoma City bombing, in terms of its service as a warning about right-wing violence, became greatly lessened. This is a lesson that Americans must now recall and recover. Radical Islam, whether abroad or homegrown, represents a serious threat to the safety and security of Americans.  But right-wing extremism did not disappear after September 11. Its history since the Oklahoma City bombing has consisted of a steady stream of plots, conspiracies, terrorist acts, and hate crimes.  It, too, represents a serious threat. In fact, in recent years, violence from the extreme right has again surged—and at levels reminiscent of the dark days of the 1990s. From 1995 through 2000, according to statistics from the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, right-wing extremists were responsible for at least 47 different terrorist acts, conspiracies or plots. However, during the past six years, from 2009 through 2014, right-wing extremists in the U.S. were involved in at least 42 actual or attempted terrorist acts. In other words, right-wing violence today is actually at or very close to levels during the days of the Oklahoma City bombing. These statistics illustrate that ""homegrown violent extremism"" is not limited to extremism motivated by radical Islam.  The anger and hate that generated the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 is still around in 2015—and still dangerous. The 20th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing provides a new opportunity for us to ensure that its significance does not disappear from the public eye. What the tragedies of 1995 and 2001 together teach is that the United States faces threats from multiple sources of extremism, all of which must be taken seriously. Consequently, Americans must have the wisdom to respond effectively and intelligently to ideological violence stemming from all sources. That would be the most positive way to pay homage to the victims of April 19, 1995.","Twenty years ago, on April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh set off a massive bomb in Oklahoma City .

"(CNN)If you cared deeply about something, would you protest? Make a sign? Join a demonstration? How long could you keep going for, in the face of indifference and inaction? When more than 200 Nigerian girls were kidnapped from their school a year ago by Boko Haram militants, millions of people around the world joined a social media campaign to plead for their safe return. Charles Alasholuyi was one of those people -- from celebrities to world leaders -- voicing their anger via #BringBackOurGirls, one of the top Twitter hashtags of 2014, used in more than four million tweets. But as weeks turned into months, there was still no sign of the missing girls. The spotlight on the campaign faded. People stopped tweeting. They stopped marching. They stopped pleading with the Nigerian government to do more to rescue the young students. It seemed everyone had given up hope that the girls would come back. Many questioned whether they were even still alive. Everyone, that is, except Alasholuyi. The marketing professional and father-of-three has taken time nearly every single day since the girls went missing to hold up a sign featuring the #BringBackOurGirls hashtag, have his colleague take his photo with it, and post it on CNN iReport. Alasholuyi, a believer in the saying that ""an injury done to one, is an injury done to all,"" says he does this to help give the families of the girls a voice. He admits his daily routine can be stressful and frustrating and he hopes that one day soon, he will be able to stop doing it. But so far he hasn't dared give up his commitment, saying he feels a moral obligation to continue posting his daily photo until the girls are returned. He says he doesn't want anyone to forget about them and the struggles their families are facing every day the girls are missing. #BringBackOurGirls one year on: 'We should all feel shame' Alasholuyi adds messages on the signs like ""over 200 stolen dreams,"" ""save the girls now"" and ""our government has a responsibility to protect us all."" Over the past year, he has also worked with organizations who are holding the Nigerian government accountable, demanding they do more to find the girls. Most recently, he participated in a 10-kilometer march through Lagos. He has also met local leaders to highlight the need for girls to be able to get an education without the fear of being abducted. Malala's letter to the abducted schoolgirls . Alasholuyi has also appealed to his government  -- and other nations -- to fight the violence imposed by Boko Haram which has carried out multiple attacks and abductions since the kidnapping of the Chibok girls. ""Yesterday was Chibok, the day before yesterday it was somewhere in the north, today it could be another town. Tomorrow it could be my village,"" he said. ""Why not cry out loud now for the whole world to come to our aid and make sure that the Boko Haram insurgency and their senseless abductions are nipped in the bud."" He told CNN he believes the newly-elected government, which is due to take office on May 29, will step up efforts to locate the girls. He is confident president elect Muhammadu Buhari, the country's newly-elected president and a retired Major General in the Nigerian Army, will do more to combat the threat of Boko Haram. Alasholuyi says he believes in miracles and hopes his passion, commitment and determination to help the Chibok girls through his daily photos will one day bring them home safely.

"(CNN)Barney Frank, to say the least, knows his way around politics. In a Chicago appearance recently, the retired congressman had the sold-out crowd at the Center on Halsted well entertained as he detailed his 45-year journey in public service. Frank, you'll recall, was the first member of Congress to marry someone of the same-sex while in office, and among other things, he had some choice words for closeted politicians who vote against LGBT rights. And when someone in the audience asked his thoughts about a current ballot proposal in California that would legalize killing gay people, he said he wasn't aware of the measure but told the young man not to ""worry yourself about the crazy people."" ""We're winning,"" he said before joking that the name of the California proposal -- ""The Sodomite Suppression Act"" -- sounded like a porno. ""We're winning"" is a phrase I've heard a lot recently as it pertains to LGBT rights. And I guess if you look at where the country was 10 years ago, we definitely are. That's assuming you are part of the ""we"" that believes LGBT people should have the same rights as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts. Or at least not ""be put to death by bullets to the head or by any other convenient method"" as the California proposal suggests. (It's unclear whether Matt McLaughlin, the Huntington Beach lawyer who submitted the proposal, is being sincere or just an ass, but the fact remains that if he collects enough signatures there appears to be no legal way of stopping it from going on the ballot.) Frank's ""we're winning"" declaration was oddly timed, too. Less than 24 hours after his talk, the governor in the next state over signed an anti-LGBT ""religious freedom"" bill into the law -- one that allows businesses to challenge in court local laws that forbid discriminating against customers based on sexual orientation. ""Many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action,"" Indiana Gov. Mike Pence said. Not to be outdone, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he would sign a similar bill that is expected to reach his desk shortly. So we have: A fledgling proposal to kill the gays out West, laws to deny us goods and services in the heartland, and if the rhetoric of 2016 hopeful Ted Cruz is a barometer, a federal ban on same-sex marriage still on the GOP table. Like others, I had foolishly hoped the upcoming general election would be one defined by bold ideas. Instead, it looks like it's going to be dragged down to a replay of Pat Buchanan's ""cultural war"" speech, during which he told the 1992 Republican National Convention: ""We stand with (George H.W. Bush) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women"" and later followed with ""There is a religious war going on in this country. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the Cold War itself. For this war is for the soul of America."" Progressives enjoyed poking fun at Cruz, the tea party darling when he announced his presidential bid, but according to the American Civil Liberties Union, ""the Indiana RFRA [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate. Numerous other bills specifically single out the LGBT community for unequal treatment."" It's not just lawmakers. Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore made headlines for telling state officials and judges to disregard a federal court ruling that overturned the state's ban on same-sex marriage. And this week. a federal judge in Cruz's home state of Texas blocked a federal rule that would have granted married, same-sex couples access to the Family and Medical Leave Act, a law that helps employees stay home to take care of a severely ill spouse. It seems clear that even if Cruz doesn't capture the GOP nomination, whoever does will undoubtedly make some concessions to appease LGBT rights backlash currently underway in conservative states. That could include one of Cruz's agenda items: a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, usurping whatever ruling comes out of the Supreme Court in June, when the court is expected to rule on whether such marriage is constitutionally protected. And the NCAA can issue strongly worded statements, as it did over Indiana's new anti-LGBT law, and -- along with others in corporate America -- can threaten financial repercussions for discriminatory laws. But at the end of the day, it's about votes. Frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets, and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls. If that holds true in 2016, ""winning"" is going to feel very strange. Indeed, most 2016 hopefuls on the right have been reluctant to express support for same-sex marriage. According to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, ""it's like asking someone who's Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli."" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said, ""I certainly will support Ted Cruz and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage."" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has a long history of fighting against same sex marriage and civil unions. And Ben Carson said jail turns people gay, so there's that. (He later apologized) Gallup polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly, but the trend on the state level tells a different story. Perhaps we're witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases. Or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated. Barney Frank said he believes Republicans want the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the GOP primary. That may be true, but it's doubtful that will allow a candidate to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called ""religious freedom"" bills currently snaking through red-state legislatures. Or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop -- especially with Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate. Once again, our democracy is vexed by a woefully inadequate two-party system. Socially liberal, fiscally conservative independent voters may want to consider the full depth of a candidate's policies before making a decision, but ultimately it may come down to a single-question: to discriminate against LGBT people or not. Unfortunately, the pending 2016 ""cultural war"" does not allow for much wiggle room beyond that. I know Frank and others have said ""we're winning"" but sitting here, watching the life being sucked out of democracy year in and year out feels more like a defeat than a victory.","LZ: Barney Frank may say LGBT rights 'winning,' but Indiana law pushing them back, and other states' anti-LGBT moves, a bad sign .
Cruz, Huckabee, Jindal, Carson, Walker and some state judges rulings, feel like 2016 reviving culture wars, he says ."
"(CNN)A brutal raid on the Garissa University College in Kenya has left nearly 150 people dead -- including  students -- and dozens more wounded. Gunmen attacked the campus early Thursday as morning prayers were underway, shooting indiscriminately and taking hostages before being killed by security forces, officials said. The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi said Al-Shabaab militants have claimed responsibility. The harrowing attack comes just months after Al-Shabaab militants murdered non-Muslim workers in a Kenyan quarry. The terrorist group has been behind numerous attacks in the region. It has also recruited some Americans, particularly from the Somali-American community in Minnesota. Al-Shabaab is a Somali group that the United States designated as a foreign terrorist organization in March 2008. It wants to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The group has been blamed for attacks in Somalia that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers. It has a history of striking abroad, too. Before admitting to the Kenya quarry attack, Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the July 2010 suicide bombings in Kampala, Uganda, that killed more than 70 people, including a U.S. citizen, who had gathered at different locations to watch the broadcast of the World Cup final soccer match. The total size of Al-Shabaab is not clear. In 2011, a U.S. official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information said the group was estimated to control up to 1,000 fighters. A United Nations report identified one insurgent leader who is believed to command ""an estimated force of between 200 and 500 fighters,"" most of them Kenyans. And Al-Shabaab has links to other organizations. In February 2012, the group's leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane, and al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a video announcing the alliance of the two organizations. Decades of weak government amid grinding poverty have long made Somalia a target for radical Islamist groups. Al-Shabaab's predecessor was al-Ittihad al-Islami (AIAI), which worked to create an Islamist emirate in Somalia. It was partially funded by former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. AIAI, which the U.S. State Department designated as a terrorist group, strengthened after the fall in 1991 of Siad Barre's military regime and during the years of lawlessness that ensued. In 2003, a rift erupted between AIAI's old guard -- which was seeking to establish a new political front -- and its younger members, who wanted to impose fundamental Islamic rule. (Al-Shabaab means ""the youth."") That strife led the younger members to ally with a group of Sharia courts -- the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) -- that was seeking to impose order over a landscape marked by feuding warlords in the capital city. Working together, the Islamic Courts Union and Al-Shabaab gained control of Mogadishu in 2006. That sparked fears in neighboring Ethiopia that violence would spill over there, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Those fears -- combined with a request from Somalia's transitional government -- led Ethiopian forces to enter Somalia in December 2006 to remove the ICU from power. And that move inflamed Al-Shabaab, which then attacked Ethiopian forces and gained control of parts of central and southern Somalia, according to a 2011 case study by Rob Wise, who was then with the Counterterrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In 2011, after attacks on tourist destinations in northern Kenya blamed on Al-Shabaab, the Kenyan government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. Ethiopian troops have also crossed the border and expelled Al-Shabaab from Baidoa, a strategic town midway between the Ethiopian border and Mogadishu. The group then targeted African Union soldiers and government buildings in the capital in suicide attacks. A suicide bombing in March 2012 killed five people at the presidential palace. Analysts say tension appears to have been growing within Al-Shabaab between Somalis and foreign fighters, several hundred of whom are thought to have entered Somalia in recent years to join the group. The group has a sophisticated public relations arm that includes a Twitter account and video production abilities. Al-Shabaab has even made a video that's as slickly produced as a reality TV show, complete with a hip-hop jihad voice and a startling message: . ""Mortar by mortar, shell by shell, only going to stop when I send them to hell,"" an unidentified voice raps in English. But Al-Shabaab's enemies -- and alliances -- can shift. Abu Mansour al-Amriki, a former Al-Shabaab fighter and prolific English-language propagandist for the group, said in a video posted online last year that he had had a fallout with Al-Shabaab ""regarding matters of the Sharia and matters of strategy"" and feared for his life. Al-Amriki, whose real name is Omar Hammami, was reportedly killed in Somalia by Al-Shabaab. CNN was not able to confirm the report. Finding replacements might not be difficult. Sheikh Ahmed Matan, a member of Britain's Somali community, said he knows of hundreds of young Somali men living in the West who returned to Somalia for terrorist training. Al-Shabaab has also ""succeeded in recruiting a number of Americans to fight in Somalia, most of whom are from Minnesota,"" CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen wrote in a CNN.com column. In 2008, the FBI launched Operation Rhino, ""a serious effort to crack down on anyone traveling to Somalia to support Al-Shabaab,"" Bergen wrote. The once-ragtag al Qaeda affiliate has grown into an economic powerhouse, raising tens of millions of dollars in cash from schemes that have involved extortion, illegal taxation and other ""fees,"" according to the 2011 United Nations report. The United States believed then that the group was coordinating with al Qaeda groups in Yemen and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad. In 2011, it was generating ""between $70 million and $100 million per year, from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports, taxes on goods and services, taxes in kind on domestic produce, 'jihad contributions,' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation,"" according to the report from the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea. In 2011, the U.N. declared a famine in the southern Somalia regions of Bakool and Lower Shabelle, and Al-Shabaab reversed an earlier pledge to allow aid agencies to provide food in famine-stricken areas. That year, the U.N. Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation said Somalia had the highest mortality rate in the world for children ages 4 and younger. About 258,000 Somalis died in the famine between October 2010 and April 2012, and half the victims were younger than 5 years old, according to a report from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network. The United States has supported U.N.-backed African forces fighting Al-Shabaab and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group. It has also donated millions of dollars in aid. In September 2012, Somali parliament members selected Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new president in a vote that marked a milestone for the nation, which had not had a stable central government since Barre's overthrow 21 years earlier. But that didn't mean Al-Shabaab was calling it quits. In January 2013, French forces attempted to rescue a French intelligence commando held hostage in Somalia by the group. The raid left the soldier dead, another soldier missing and 17 Islamist fighters dead. But there has been political progress in Somalia. In January 2013, for the first time in more than two decades, the United States granted official recognition to the Somali government. CNN's Tim Lister, Barbara Starr, Paula Newton, David McKenzie and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Al-Shabaab is an al-Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia .

"(CNN)A South African university is celebrating the removal of a British colonialist's statue after weeks of protests. University of Cape Town students took to social media  to demand Cecil Rhodes' statue come down, saying his legacy is tainted with racism. Using the hashtag #RhodesMustFall, students expressed their views in a campaign that started last month. Four weeks later, the hashtag is now #RhodesHas Fallen. The university said Wednesday the heritage authority granted it permission to remove the statue from the campus. ""These steps are being taken to ensure the safety of the statue while matters concerning its future are resolved,"" the university said in a statement. Rhodes' statue was first unveiled in 1934 at the university, which also has a scholarship and memorial in his name. #RhodesMustFall gained attention after activists threw excrement on the statue in March. ""He represents the former colonial representation of this country -- supremacy, racism, misogyny,"" says Ramabina Mahapa, president of the students' Representative Council, which led the fight to remove the statue. ""Students are saying these aren't the ideals that we want to have here,"" Mahapa says. ""The statue represents what is wrong with society."" But in Pretoria, another group of protesters disagreed. ""This isn't confronting history, this is erasing it,"" says Steve Hofmeyr, a singer who participated in a campaign Thursday that involved activists chaining themselves to the Paul Kruger statue in response to #RhodesHasFallen. Days earlier,  Kruger's statue was pelted with green paint. The Afrikaner is known for his opposition to the British. Afrikaner groups also chained themselves to the statue of Dutch colonizer Jan van Riebeeck in Cape Town. ""I don't want fewer monuments,"" Hofmeyr says. ""I want more monuments erected. But don't defile the ones that exist -- we are the sum total of all the history, not just the fun parts."" Mahapa said removing a statue shouldn't be equated with removing history. ""People down the years will be looking at the statue and at his history and what he did,"" Mahapa says. ""We need to be moving toward becoming an Afrocentric university where African thought can be appreciated."" Hofmeyr said the statue is a race issue. ""There are huge gaping differences between people in South Africa and that is why you need dialogue, which you can't have without its monuments and statues,"" he says. Students marked the removal of Rhodes' statue with a celebratory march. They held signs that said ""we're not done yet."" With the statue removed, some asked what's next for the movement.","Cape Town students demand Cecil Rhodes' statue come down .

"(CNN)Syria is a Hell on Earth that is expanding in plain sight. The death toll there has doubled in a year's time, if an opposition group is right. Since civil war broke out there, 310,000 people have been killed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Thursday. A year earlier, SOHR's tally stood at 162,402. And the year before, the United Nations put the death toll at 70,000. Violence has plunged well over half of all Syrians into such destitution that they are in dire need of survival aid, the United Nations says, as food rations are being cut for lack of donations. Numbers alone can't convey the immeasurable anguish of millions, but maybe it can remind the rest of us of the magnitude of the world's currently greatest tragedy. The number of years since perpetual bloodshed began, since dictator Bashar al-Assad's security forces fired on crowds of demonstrators and armed militant groups rose up against him in March 2011. Percentage of the Syrian population killed. It would be like killing 3 to 4 million Americans. The range comes from the SOHR's death toll of 310,000 and a recent lower estimate by the U.N. of at least 220,000 dead. The number of Syrians in need of immediate life-saving aid, according to the U.N.  That's the population of Moscow. Syrians driven from their homes, the U.N. says. Imagine the entire Boston metropolitan area emptied out. Syrians who have fled as refugees to neighboring countries, creating humanitarian and economic hardship across Syria's borders. Turkey has taken in 1.7 million, Lebanon 1.2 million, Jordan 625,000, and Iraq 245,000. The reduction in the size of food rations the World Food Programme says it has been forced to make due to a lack of donations. That means people receiving aid will get only 60% of the daily nutrition they need.","More people have been displaced than live in Moscow; more people lost their homes than live in greater Boston .

"(CNN)Silent, almost shy as she headed into Manhattan Criminal Court, Ailina Tsarnaeva was anything but timid when it came to a perceived rival, prosecutors say. According to a criminal complaint, Tsarnaeva threatened a woman in a phone call this summer, saying ""Leave my man alone."" ""Stop looking for him. ... I know people that can put a bomb where you live,"" she said, according to the complaint. Considering who was making the threats, prosecutors didn't consider it a joke and charged Tsarnaeva with aggravated harassment, which she denies. Leaving court last December, she and her lawyer refused to discuss the case. Tsarnaeva is the sister of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Authorities allege the brothers are responsible for the 2013 Boston marathon bombing, which left three people dead and more than 260 others injured. Police shot and killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, during the manhunt and later captured Dzhokhar, who is now on trial. Tsarnaev's lawyers don't dispute that he did it. The defense argues that he was influenced and enlisted by his older, self-radicalized brother to commit acts of terror. Defense rests in Boston Marathon bombing trial . The Tsarnaev family first immigrated to the Boston area back in 2002. The parents, fleeing a troubled region of Russia, were treated as legal residents and granted asylum -- a status that opened the door for taxpayer-funded welfare. The state of Massachusetts has confirmed the Tsarnaevs received food stamps, public housing and other aid, on and off, between 2002 and 2012. During this time, Tamerlan Tsarnaev began his conversion to radical Islam. Then, according to investigators, he began filling his younger brother's head with a hatred toward the West. Not much is known about the two Tsarnaeva daughters, Ailina, 24, and Bella, 26, though their last known address was in North Bergen, New Jersey. Along with charges of making bomb threats, Ailina Tsarnaeva has a past record that includes misleading police in a counterfeiting case. She pleaded guilty but got no jail time. She was also charged with leaving the scene of an accident, but that charge was dismissed. Her older sister, Bella, was charged with marijuana possession and intent to distribute after a 2012 arrest, and she entered a pretrial intervention program. Even their mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, has had issues with the law. She fled back to Russia in 2012, where she remains a fugitive. Records show that she was arrested in June 2012 for allegedly shoplifting $1,600 worth of women's clothing from a Boston-area Lord & Taylor department store. She is wanted on felony charges of shoplifting and destruction of property. Russia raised concerns to U.S. authorities about her in 2011 at the same time they asked the United States about her son Tamerlan, several sources told CNN shortly after the 2013 attack. U.S. authorities added the mother and son to the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, database -- a collection of more than a half-million names maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center, an intelligence official said. FBI agents interviewed Zubeidat Tsarnaev as part of the investigation into her son, whose case was closed after several months. The radicalization of Tsarnaev . In Russia, she has maintained her innocence in the shoplifting case while also calling the charges against her sons ""made up."" Though not elaborating on her beliefs, Ailina Tsarnaeva has said she believes, as her mother does, that her surviving brother Dzhokhar and her dead brother Tamerlan are innocent. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 21, faces 30 criminal counts, including using a weapon of mass destruction causing death. On Tuesday, one day after federal prosecutors rested after calling more than 90 witnesses, defense lawyers rested their case without calling Tsarnaev to the stand. Closing arguments are expected Monday. Tsarnaev attorney: 'It was him' Watch Erin Burnett weekdays 7pm ET.

"(CNN)A door bearing a graffiti drawing by British artist Banksy was seized by police in Gaza on Thursday after a dispute over its sale, a Gaza police official told CNN on Thursday. The owner of the door, Rabea Darduna, filed a complaint with a Gaza court stating that, without realizing its value, he sold the door for just $175 U.S. The iron door will remain in the possession of the Khan Younis police in southern Gaza until a court hearing at a date yet to be determined. When Darduna's Gaza home was destroyed in last summer's war, he says he felt he was left with nothing. Only a doorway and a door. He sold the door to bring in some money to care for his six children, not realizing the prize he had. ""We sold it as we would sell an iron door,"" Darduna said Monday, ""for $175. And the man took it."" Darduna says he was duped into believing the door was a normal door when it was really a canvas for Banksy, one of the world's most famous graffiti artists, who had painted a Greek goddess with her head in her hand. The door was likely worth a small fortune -- a fortune Darduna gave away for a fraction of its value. ""Things started becoming clear that the artist is worldwide famous, and he drew it secretly,"" said Darduna. ""[The buyer] used us. My house is demolished. We're destroyed emotionally. We ask him to return the door."" Banksy's graffiti in Gaza has become an attraction after he visited in February and painted a series of political messages. His works adorn walls and homes turning rubble into riches. Some of Banksy's art has sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Banksy has never revealed his identity, but he is an English graffiti artist who began displaying his work in the early 1990s. His street art often portrays political and social messages. Mohammed Alshanbari says he's had offers for Banksy's portrait of a cat playing with a ball of mangled metal, but he refuses to sell. In text accompanying the image on his official website, Banksy wrote: ""A local man came up and said 'Please -- what does this mean?' I explained I wanted to highlight the destruction in Gaza by posting photos on my website -- but on the internet people only look at pictures of kittens."" Alshanbari says he's looking after the mural on the wall where his house once stood. ""A lot of people showed up and people asked to buy it, but I'm keeping it, and I won't sell it,"" he says. ""It's a graffiti from the most famous artist in the world, and I can't give it away. It stands where the house used to stand. I cleared a lot of rubble, but left the wall."" CNN's Talal Abu-Rahma reported from Gaza and CNN's Steve Almasy reported from Atlanta. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Oren Liebermann contributed to this report.","Rabea Darduna's Gaza home was destroyed last year; he sold his door to bring in some money .

"(CNN)The onslaught on Houthis rebels in Yemen continued Tuesday, with the Saudi-led coalition asserting increasing control while locals fled the chaos and casualties piled up -- dozens of civilians among them. Five days after their first airstrikes, the coalition has destroyed air defense systems of the Houthis and supporters of Yemen's longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and rendered all but a fraction of air bases and stripes unusable, a Saudi source said. Saudi Arabia's navy now controls all Yemeni ports, allowing only closely watched non-military medical goods to pass its blockade, according to the source. This effort isn't over, including widespread attempts to locate and destroy Scud missiles still in the country, the source said. The Saudis appear intent on seeing it through, as evidenced by remarks from Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal in Riyadh. ""The Houthi militia and agents of the former president -- supported by Iran -- insist to meddle in Yemen, reshuffle the cards, rob the Yemeni will, make a coup against the constitutional legitimacy and reject all peaceful solutions,"" al-Faisal said, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency. ""We are not warmongers,"" he added. ""But if war's drums are beaten, we are ready for them."" The airstrikes -- the latest focused around Aden, Taiz and coastal cities -- come at a cost, and not just to Houthi rebel fighters. The International Red Cross said that intense fighting had brought ""disturbing reports of civilian casualties,"" with some of the worst violence around the port city of Aden. Erich Ogoso, a spokesman with the United Nations' humanitarian agency, reported 182 dead and hundreds more wounded just between last Wednesday and Sunday. Some 75,000 people have been displaced in the past week,  many health facilities shut down and food prices have skyrocketed. ""Increasing hostilities have led to (the) targeting of schools, health facilities and other social infrastructure,"" Ogoso said. ""... There are reports of damage to residential areas in different cities, and in Aden, minors have reportedly taken part in the fighting on all sides."" Airstrikes that hit the Al-Mazraq camp for displaced persons near Sanaa killed at least 29 people -- women and children among them, according to aid group Doctors Without Borders. About 1,100 families live in the camp, said U.N.'s humanitarian affairs coordinator for Yemen, Johannes Van Der Klaauw. ""They are,"" he said, ""among the most vulnerable people in Yemen."" Yemen has been in disarray for some time, beset by widespread poverty and insecurity. Those factors helped terror groups like al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula find homes in the Arab nation, but didn't help its 26 million citizens in their quest for peace and prosperity. The instability escalated as the Houthis, a minority group long marginalized in Yemen, increasingly challenged the government of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi (who in 2012 took over for Saleh, who had been in power for 33 years). The Houthis began moving into Sanaa in September, then headed into Aden earlier this month -- advancing despite intermittent (and, time and again, unsuccessful) talks aimed a peaceful political solution to the unrest. Things finally came to a head last week, with Hadi -- who claims to still be President, even though the Houthis control government institutions -- left Yemen. At roughly the same time, Saudi Arabia and its allies came in with force to support Hadi, who they say remains Yemen's legitimate leader. The burgeoning conflict threatened to open a wider rift, not just in the region but in the Muslim world. That's because the Saudis have painted the Houthis as tools of Iran's government, an accusation that also reflects the fact Saudi Arabia (and their allies in the coalition) are predominantly Sunni Muslims, while Iran and the Houthis are Shiites. The state-run Saudi Press Agency quoted Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Saud al-Faisal as saying Tuesday that he would not condemn Iran, but would instead test the country's intentions ""by extending our hands to it as a Muslim neighbor to open a new page."" If those two countries could achieve real cooperation, it could ease the pressures that are tearing Yemen apart. On the other side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said that officials in his country and Saudi Arabia can help bring about a ""political solution"" in Yemen, according to Iran's state-run Press TV, citing AFP. If they don't, war could inflame the entire region. ""We strongly object to the military solution in Yemen,"" Amir-Abdollahian said, reiterating a view made by other Iranian officials. ""We believe that the Saudi military attack against Yemen is a strategic mistake.""","Saudi minister: ""If war's drums are beaten, we are ready for them""

"Holland manager Guus Hiddink has slammed his own supporters for booing Andres Iniesta during his side's 2-0 victory against Spain on Tuesday night and branded them a 'disgrace'. Spain coach Vicente del Bosque fielded an experimental side at the Amsterdam Arena with Iniesta, who started on the bench, entering the fray in the 76th minute to chorus of jeering and boos from the home fans. Centre back Stefan de Vrij and midfielder Davy Klaassen scored first-half goals in the morale-boosting victory, but Hiddink was unimpressed with the way Iniesta was treated. Spain midfielder Andres Iniesta controls the ball during his side's 2-0 defeat by Holland on Tuesday night . 'It's a disgrace,' said Hiddink. 'He's a world class player and a wonderful person. At first I didn't notice it was about him. Was it because of his goal against the Netherlands in 2010? 'It's unbelievable, this is about sport. What was he supposed to do? I can't understand this.' Tuesday night's friendly win was a much-needed boost for Hiddink who has endured a tough start to his second stint as national coach. Holland boss Guus Hiddink slammed the home fans for booing Iniesta after his arrival in the 76th minute . In the seven matches leading up to the victory against Spain, his team had beaten only Kazakhstan and Latvia in European qualifiers and lost to Italy, the Czech Republic, Iceland and Mexico in qualifiers and friendlies. 'I don't have the feeling that there is pressure on my shoulders, ' Hiddink added. 'I don't want to fight against the media any more, I just want to stay focused on football. There are always stories in the press. Stefan de Vrij (second from left) heads past Spain goalkeeper David de Gea to make it 1-0 . Davy Klaassen doubles Holland's advantage after seeing his initial effort saved by Spain goalkeeper De Gea . 'I saw a Netherlands squad that had the guts to play football. Although we made some mistakes, I thought we were pretty good. 'These mistakes are a good lessons for our players because you can't make these against Spain. Luckily they didn't punish us. Kenneth Vermeer saved us a few times and I thought Daley Blind and Klaassen played very well.'","Andres Iniesta started on the bench as Spain lost 2-0 to Holland .

"Football agents were left in limbo on Wednesday as they awaited news on new regulations. As of April 1, the licensing system for agents is to change so that anyone can become a football agent as long as they pay £500 for an initial one-year registration period. The FA will then charge £250 for every subsequent year of renewal. Already established licensed agents were exempt. The FA is due to place a link on their website for intermediaries to register, but as of 1pm that was still not in place. Mel Stein thinks the new regulations on becoming a football agent will 'create anarchy' The new guidelines have come in after FIFA effectively washed their hands of governing agents. FIFA recommendations include national associations registering only intermediaries of 'impeccable character', all deals annually published online, agents' fees limited to three per cent and no monies earned by them for negotiating deals for players under the age of 18. The FA, Premier League and Football League have been discussing how best to cope with FIFA opting out. All have serious concerns about how the system will work in Britain and abroad, especially in under-developed football territories. Mel Stein, chairman of the London-based Association of Football Agents, told the Guardian: 'I think it's going to create anarchy and everybody is going to be sorry about it. FIFA couldn't cope so they decided to hand it over to the individual territories. Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao (right) with his agent Jorge Mendes pictured last year . 'I can see the bloke in the pub who knows a parent or a footballer's dad saying 'I'll represent you' and then undercutting everyone.' 'It is clearly wrong and anti-competitive to have this kind of price-capping. The FA are saying we've got to do it because that's what FIFA are telling us to do. The three per cent cap will destroy the business of probably 50% of my members.' AFA (Association of Football Agents) has been holding discussions to reach a compromise and have pushed for self regulating. James Featherstone of OmniSports said: 'It's a big worry for clubs how they keep a check on who is who. These new rules will allow anyone to register as an intermediary acting on behalf of a player.'","Licensing system for new agents was due to change on April 1 .

"David Moore, 25, went berserk with road rage after leaving his home only to immediately find himself nose-to-nose on a heavily congested street with Rafal Cegielka, 45, who was picking up his child . A driver punched a father on the school run then smashed up his car with a hockey stick in front of young children because he was having a 'bad day' and saw red, a court has heard. David Moore, 25, went berserk with road rage after leaving his home only to immediately find himself bumper-to-bumper on a heavily congested street with Rafal Cegielka, 45, who was picking up his child from St John's Primary School, in Burnley, Lancashire. Burnley Magistrates' Court heard that the pair had both wound down their car windows, when Moore then jumped out of his vehicle, and punched Mr Cegielka through his open car window. He then ripped away a fencing panel from a nearby garden and chased the victim's vehicle with it as he tried to drive off. Finally, he then armed himself with the hockey stick from his home, and shouted: 'I'll f***ing kill him' in the street, before running after Mr Cegielka again and smashing up his car while he was still in it. The court heard the force of the attack caused damage worth £500. Moore later told police police he had had a 'bad day' and 'his head was all over the place.' At Burnley magistrates court Moore admitted assault by beating, destroying £100 worth of fencing and damaging Mr Cegielka's car, on March 2. He was given 16 weeks in prison, suspended for two years and was ordered to attend the Resolve programme to address his violence and temper. he was also ordered to pay £650 compensation. Prosecutor Eddie Harrison told the court the incident occurred at 2.50pm on March 2, as the victim drove onto Brent Street, which is very narrow and came nose to nose with another vehicle. The cars then became level, going in different directions. Moore, who was at the wheel of the other vehicle, wound down his window and Mr Cegielka did the same, wondering what he was going to say. But Moore got out of his car, walked over and punched the victim in the face. He then grabbed Mr Cegielka's ignition keys and hurled them into the vehicle. Mr Harrison added: 'The complainant says the defendant was totally out of control and continued shouting and swearing. Burnley Magistrates' Court heard that the pair had both wound down their car windows to exchange words outside St John's Primary School, in Burnley, Lancashire (pictured), when Moore then jumped out of his car, and punched Mr Cegielka through his open car window. He then ripped away a fencing panel from a nearby garden and chased the victim's vehicle with it as he tried to drive off . 'He was frightened by this behaviour and started his engine and drove away. 'He could see the male following him and it's at this point that the defendant has gone to a fence at a house in the street, started pulling away the fence panel, snapped it off and run down the street after the vehicle with Mr Cegielka in it. He chased after the car, clearly trying to hit out at the vehicle.' The prosecutor said the victim had to drive round the block and come back to the school to collect his child, when he again saw Moore again. Moore went into his house, got the hockey stick, and then ran after Mr Cegielka's vehicle again, shouting: 'I'll f***ing kill him.' At Burnley magistrates court Moore admitted assault by beating, destroying £100 worth of fencing and damaging Mr Cegielka's car, on March 2. He was given 16 weeks in prison, suspended for two years and was ordered to attend the Resolve programme to address his violence and temper. he was also ordered to pay £650 compensation . Mr Harrison said: 'He ran off down the middle of the road after the car and the defendant has struck it, causing damage to the vehicle whilst the complainant was still in it. He says this incident was completely unprovoked. He says he was terrified by this incident.' Moore later claimed Mr Cegielka was giving him 's**t ' for facing the wrong way in the street because it was tight at school times. He admitted grabbing the victim through the car window and screaming at him, but said he didn't punch him. He said he had been angry and had seen red, but knew what he did was wrong. He told officers: 'I'm very sorry. I had a s**t day. My head was all over the place.' In mitigation his lawyer Graeme Tindall said:  'When he was interviewed, he was full and frank. He says he didn't punch him. He flicked his glasses off his face. The incident happened because of congestion around the school. He readily accepts he saw red. He accepts he has a short fuse and reacted wholly inappropriately. In the cold light of day, he conceded all the faults that he had on that occasion.' Moore declined to comment after the hearing. Mr Cegielka was unavailable for comment.","David Moore, 25, 'saw red' after leaving his home only to immediately find himself nose-to-nose on a heavily congested street with Rafal Cegielka, 45 .

"Spain's 2-0 defeat by Holland on Tuesday brought back bitter memories of their disastrous 2014 World Cup, but coach Vicente del Bosque will not be too worried about a third straight friendly defeat, insists Gerard Pique. Holland, whose 5-1 drubbing of Spain in the group stage in Brazil last year marked the end of the Iberian nation's six-year domination of the world game, scored two early goals at the Amsterdam Arena and held on against some determined Spain pressure in the second half for a 2-0 success. They became the first team to inflict two defeats on Del Bosque since he took over in 2008 but the gruff 64-year-old had used the match to try out several new faces and he fielded a largely experimental, second-string team. Stefan de Vrij (right) headed Holland in front against Spain at the Amsterdam Arena on Tuesday . Gerard Pique (left) could do nothing to stop Davy Klaassen doubling the Dutch advantage . Malaga forward Juanmi and Sevilla midfielder Vitolo became the 55th and 56th players to debut under Del Bosque, while the likes of goalkeeper David de Gea, defenders Raul Albiol, Juan Bernat and Dani Carvajal and midfielder Mario Suarez all started the game. 'The national team's state of health is good,' centre back Gerard Pique told reporters. 'We are in a process where players are coming into the team and gathering experience,' added the Barcelona defender. 'We are second in qualifying (for Euro 2016) and these friendly games are for experimenting. 'I am not that worried about this match because we lost friendlies in previous years and then ended up winning titles.' David de Gea was given a start by Vicente del Bosque but could not keep out De Vrij's header here . Dani Carvajal (centre) was another squad player given a chance to impress against Holland . Del Bosque will be confident he can find the right mix of players to secure Spain's berth at Euro 2016 in France next year, when they will be chasing an unprecedented third straight title. Slovakia are the surprise leaders in qualifying Group C thanks to a 2-1 win over Spain in Zilina in October and have a maximum 15 points from five of 10 matches. Spain are second on 12 points, three ahead of Ukraine, who they beat 1-0 in Seville on Friday. Del Bosque's side host Slovakia in September in a match that could decide who goes through to the finals as group winners. 'The team is in good shape,' forward Pedro told reporters.

"Flames leaping and acrid smoke billowing into the sky, a huge fire rips through bone dry heathland near the south coast. In scenes resembling a disaster movie, the inferno laid waste to a picturesque area the size of 100 football pitches. It came after days of storms lashed Britain, with trees felled and roads shut. But the 70 hectare area of Dorset was tinderbox dry as much of it is on a hillside and water had run off down the slope. Fire investigators have confirmed the fire was started deliberately and three separate areas of heath - measuring half a hectare, one hectare and 70 hectares - were destroyed . More than 80 firefighters spent six hours tackling flames up to 35ft high at the St Catherine's Hill nature reserve in Dorset yesterday . Thousands of animals are feared to have been wiped out by the blaze after yesterday's strong winds of up to 45mph, coupled with bone dry ground thanks to a lack of rain, whipped the flamed across across 70 hectres of heathland . The fire was sparked by suspected arsonists in three locations. Fanned by 40mph winds, flames up to 35ft high spread rapidly through the nature reserve near Christchurch. Eighty firefighters spent hours tackling the blaze. Crews had to contend with a 400 yard wide wall of flames that moved at dangerous speeds. The billowing smoke could be seen from around ten miles away in Wimborne and Swanage. A member of the public raised the alarm at midday on Tuesday. Firefighters remained at the scene in St Catherine’s Hill nature reserve until 1.15am yesterday, after the blaze was finally brought under control. Police are treating the fire as suspicious and have appealed for witnesses as they investigate what was used to start it. Two schoolboys have today been arrested for the arson attack that devastated the sensitive heathland. The youths, aged 14 and 15, are being held by police on suspicion of deliberately starting three fires. Firefighters said that while it has rained in the area, the hilly landscape meant little moisture remained near the top of the soil. There was also a lot of dead, dry growth left over from winter, which had been the sunniest since records began in 1929. Commander Craig Baker of Dorset Fire and Rescue Service said: ‘It is probably one of the largest heath fires we’ve had for a couple of years. The main problem yesterday was the strength of the wind.’ The area, a site of special scientific interest, is home to all six species of reptile native to the UK, including sand lizards, adders and grass snakes. Experts said thousands of creatures would have been killed by the blaze. Around 50 wildlife volunteers were yesterday rescuing reptiles that survived. Nicky Hoar from Dorset Wildlife Trust said it would take 20 to 30 years for the heathland ecosystem to fully recover. Dorset Police have confirmed they are treating the fire as suspicious and investigations are ongoing but no arrests have been made yet . Billowing black smoke could be seen from 10 miles away in Wimborne and Swanage as crews battled to get the 400 metre wide fire under control . The heathland is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and home to all six species of reptile native to the UK; the sand lizard, smooth snake, adders, slow worms, grass snakes and common lizards . The huge wildlife, which was sparked by arsonists, has destroyed an area of heathland the size of a hundred football pitches in Dorset . But 350 miles away, it looked more like Christmas as a coating of snow caused a headache for unprepared commuters yesterday morning. Residents of Northumberland, Cumbria and County Durham were expecting April showers but the region’s highlands were instead blanketed in a freezing flurry. Lowson Robinson, who has been working on a model village in his garden in Cumbria for more than ten years, said: ‘The village looks lovely in the snow. There was a little flurry yesterday but I didn’t expect it to lie.’ The retired coal miner, 67, added: ‘It’s snowing today and I think it might continue until the weekend but then that should be it for the year. The weather here can get pretty bad and we get a lot of snow so it’s hard to tell but spring should be just around the corner.’ Yesterday, forecasters said there is a risk of rain across the country for the rest of the week and it will continue to be a bit colder than the seasonal average. In the south, temperatures could fall to -1C (30F). John Griffiths of MeteoGroup said: ‘Easter Sunday and Monday should be drier and brighter with sunny spells.’ Fire crews spent most of yesterday battling to bring the blaze under control and officers spent last night dampening the area down and returned today to ensure to fire didn't reignite . Experts say thousands of the creatures will have been killed by the blaze. Some 50 wildlife volunteers spent today rescuing reptiles that survived by burrowing into deep ground.

"Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has revealed how his mental strength helped him recover after being dropped last December. Mignolet was dropped 'indefinitely' by manager Brendan Rodgers in December after a poor run of form but quickly returned after Brad Jones sustained a thigh injury. And the 27-year-old Belgian told how he tried to remain upbeat despite the disappointment at being axed. Simon Mignolet has revealed how his mental strength helped him recover after being dropped . Mignolet (second right) makes a save from a free kick during a league match against Swansea last month . Mignolet told FourFourTwo: 'I was positive. Every goalkeeper goes through those stages, and you only get mentally stronger from them. Because we play so many games, I just looked forward to the next match. 'I always wanted to keep improving and moving forward. I’m in my second year now at Liverpool and I’ve learned a lot. 'There’s always something to work on. I’ve just turned 27 but I still pick up things every day. That helps get through difficult moments.' Mignolet has been in impressive form since his return and has kept six consecutive Premier League clean sheets away from home. Mignolet (right) trains alongside fellow Belgian Thibaut Courtois (centre) in Israel earlier this week . Mignolet replaces Brad Jones during a match against Burnley at Turf Moor on Boxing Day last year . He said: 'I’ve been pleased with my form, but I don’t really look at records. The most important thing is the team, and winning points. 'Keeping a clean sheet isn’t something you do on your own – it’s a group effort. Since we changed to the new system, we’ve been well organised. 'You concede or score as a unit, and at the moment from the top of the pitch to me, we are pressing well.

"The crew of a replica pirate schooner were forced to abandon ship after their vessel lost power in rough seas off the coast of Maine. Nine members of the Liana's Ransom were scooped up by Coast Guard life boats on Tuesday, leaving the Canadian charter ship adrift 30 miles east of Portland, Coast Guard officials said. The tall ship reported having issues with the engines around 12.35 a.m. on Monday, and said the sails had become wrapped around the mast. Scroll down for video . Mid-sea rescue: Coast Guard life boats facilitated a rescue of crew members from the Liana's Ransom, who had to leap from the replica schooner . Two lifeboat crews were dispatched from Gloucester, Massachusetts, to try and tow the vessel to shore, but 10-foot swells caused a tow line to break. The crew was ordered to put on immersion suits and abandon the schooner, according to a press release from the Coast Guard. In a video of the rescue, a man in a jacket successfully makes the jump from the Liana's Ransom to the lifeboat as the two ships pitch in the rough seas. CBS reports crew member Luke Arbuckle came up short while attempting to make the jump to the Coast Guard ship. 'Apparently the ship separated just as I jumped over, and I ended up in the water,' Arbuckle said. Arbuckle's forehead struck the side of the boat while jumping, and he was rescued and transported by a Coast Guard helicopter to the hospital, where he was treated and later released. Safe and sound: The crew was reportedly dehydrated and seasick after being caught in choppy weather early Monday morning . Pulled out: Crew member Luke Arbuckle shorted the jump as the two boats tilted away from each other and struck his head against the boat before being airlifted to the hospital . Ahoy: The 85-foot-long ship was on its way to St Maarten in the Caribbean with nine crew members on its first voyage of the season . The 24-year-old captain of the Liana's Ransom, Ryan Tilley, was the last crew member to depart the drifting ship, his father, Joseph Tilley, wrote on the ship's Facebook page. 'Seeing the ship crippled, damaged and left floating there as we motored away with the Coast Guard was probably one of the worst moments of my life, but you have to put lives first,' Ryan told WCVB. The boat was towed to  Kittery Point Yacht Yard in Eliot, Massachusetts, on Tuesday evening where it will be repaired. The ship's website states the vessel was on its way to St Maarten, which was to be its new home port, when it lost engine power. The schooner, which has a 70-passenger capacity, was built to resemble ships used by privateers and pirates in the 1700s and is equipped with replica black powder cannons, according to the site.","The crew of the Liana's Ransom, an 85-foot-long replica schooner, were rescued by the Coast Guard early Monday morning .

"Amazing pictures have emerged of  blue fluorescent algae lighting up Australia's east coast. The images were taken in Jervis Bay, the south coast of NSW, as the neon glow illuminated one of Australia's popular beaches. Photographer Andy Hutchinson described the sight as a 'beautiful supernatural scene' caused by millions of plankton omitting light. A similar display was shown in Sydney's Manly Beach back in August 2014 where an oceanography expert told Daily Mail Australia there was no need to be concerned about the algae. 'The glow is caused by Noctiluca scintillans, which is a single celled phytoplankton - the algae of the sea - which blossoms in the spring and the autumn and in 90 per cent of occasions occurs due to natural causes,' Iain Suthers, of University of New South Wales, said. Mr Suthers explained that the bizarre carnivorous cell, which preys on another type of algae called diatoms, gives off the luminous glow as a defence mechanism. Scroll down for video .

"The Red Wings' Drew Miller says he's eager to hit the ice again just a day after receiving a cut that could have cost him his eyesight. 'I feel very blessed the skate didn't hit my eye,' Miller said at practice on Wednesday. 'Very lucky' Skating with a full face mask during practice, the Detroit forward openly bore a gruesome red wound that required 50 to 60 stitches to close along multiple layers of skin, the Detroit Free Press reports. Gruesome: Miller was left with a scar across his eye, but reportedly didn't suffer any damage to his eyesight after another player cut him across his face . The incident occurred shortly after a faceoff during the first period of Tuesday's game between the Red Wings and the Senators. While battling for the puck, Ottawa's Mark Stone lost his balance and lifted his right skate backwards in an arc, catching Miller just under his visor. Stone's skate cut Miller along his right cheek and again just below his eyebrow. Miller exited the ice under his own power before medical staff rushed him to receive treatment, including stitches. Though he has a gash that runs across both sides of his eyelid and bruising below his right eye, Miller said his vision was largely unaffected.

"A Reading fan is facing a three-year ban after running topless on to the pitch and performing a series of somersaults during his first-ever game at the Madejski Stadium. Charlie Sumner, 20, staged a one-man pitch invasion during the Royals' FA Cup 3-0 quarter-final replay win over Bradford City last month. Sumner, whose team were 3-0 up at the time, did four front flips on the pitch - landing on his back, before being tackled by stewards. Reading fan Charlie Sumner (left) faces a three-year football ban after his one-man pitch invasion last month . Sumner - who said going to his first game was a 'brilliant experience' - is now facing a potential three-year ban for carrying out the stunt. The order, due to be decided on April 30, would stop him going to all of Reading's future home and away matches. On Wednesday, Sumner, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said he had no regrets about the incident, adding that he had done it for 'laugh' and that his family had 'seen the funny side'. Speaking outside court, he said: 'After doing it and seeing good comments and messages, even from the away fans, I don't look back and regret it. The incident occurred during the Royals' 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final replay win over Bradford . 'Obviously I wouldn't inform other people to do it. It was just spur of the moment. It's good to see good feedback and not negative feedback. 'I'd had a few drinks, I was happy and Reading were winning and I just went for it and had a laugh. It was brilliant.' Asked whether he goes to many Reading matches, he added: 'That was my first game actually. It was a good experience. Obviously being there on the first game - not after what I've done, but standing in the stadium, watching the game from the stadium - it's a brilliant experience. 'Obviously with the ban, I wouldn't be able to experience that experience again.' The incident took place on March 16, when the match was being broadcast live to millions of viewers on BBC One. Afterwards, footage of Sumner's antics also went viral on the internet. Despite facing a potential banning order  Sumner was in good spirits outside Reading Magistrates' Court . Sumner, who went to the match with a group of eight friends, said he spoke to them in a taxi on the way to the match about potentially running on to the pitch. 'I did say no at first. Then Reading were winning and I got a bit excited,' he said. 'I went to rave on Friday and there's another video on Facebook and I'm doing flips there. I've had a few selfies, a few drinks bought for me.' But Sumner, who works as a dry liner fixing ceilings, said he thought a potential football banning order 'seemed a bit much.' After running on to the pitch, Sumner (centre) was tackled by stewards and footage of his antics went viral . 'I don't want a three-year ban because obviously it's quite a bit,' he said. 'I'm not encouraging people do it and if I go to another game, I'm not going to do it again.' At Wednesday's hearing, Sumner's solicitor entered a guilty plea on his client's behalf to one count of going on to a playing area at a football match under the Football Offences Act 1991. Sumner, who was at court but missed his hearing after leaving the building briefly, was released on bail with conditions that he does not attend Reading's home or away matches. He will appear at Reading Magistrates' Court on April 30 when a decision will be made on whether he receives a football banning order.

"Former pub landlord Michael Thorpe has had his conviction for illegally showing foreign footage of Premier League games overturned after eight years . A pub landlord convicted of showing Premier League football matches on foreign TV channels has won an eight-year legal battle to clear his name. Michael Thorpe says he has paid a heavy price for the lengthy fight to get his conviction quashed and has lost his pub as a result. Mr Thorpe, 55, was convicted of showing a Premier League game without having an agreement with official broadcasters in November 2006 at the Stoke Inn in Plymouth, Devon. He said he could not afford to pay Sky TV's rates for football matches, and opted instead to show Albanian transmissions of matches, which he says he thought was legal. But he was convicted, fined and ordered to pay costs eight years ago, when screening the matches was still treated as a criminal offence. Judge Recorder Nicolas Gerasimidis has now upheld his appeal and overturned the conviction following a landmark European court ruling. His appeal took so long as he had to launch the case  after the European Court of Justice found enforcing previous rules was anti-competitive. Mr Thorpe said he was 'overwhelmed' that a judge and magistrates had upheld his appeal after all this time. But it is a bitter-sweet victory, as the long-running dispute cost him his business and his livelihood. He said: 'We put a lot of money into that pub and it went from a thriving business to absolutely zero. People stopped coming to the pub, it cost me my business.' Mr Thorpe launched an appeal against his conviction soon after his trial, but the case was delayed by a similar test case which went as far as the European Court of Justice. The court ruled that having an exclusive system was a restraint of free trade and contrary to European Law. But the landlord says the court action has seen him lose the Stoke Inn in Plymouth which he used to run . Mr Thorpe's appeal was further delayed until another case involving Media Protection Services Ltd, the company which took him to court on behalf of the Premier League, but which no longer does so. Mr Thorpe was awarded his legal costs, which he paid privately, but he would not disclose the sum. The European court decision in 2012 cleared a landlady of a criminal conviction, but judges left the door open for court action against publicans by ruling pubs should get permission from the copyright owner before screening matches. The Premier League has since been taking landlords to civil courts for breaching copyright, with some ordered to pay up to £65,000 in costs. The league sends teams of investigators to pubs around the country to try and catch those screening games illegally. Legal cases have  been brought against 250 bars and pubs during the current football season. He said he does not know whether he can retrieve the £1,000 fine and £1,500 costs ordered by the magistrates. Despite the decision, the Premier League has insisted pubs still cannot show foreign-TV footage of its games. Since the European Court decision, it is taking landlords to civil courts and suing them using copyright laws, which were not affected by the previous ruling. In 2012, pub Karen Murphy landlady won a landmark legal battle to overturn her conviction for using foreign decoders instead of Sky to show Premier League football matches. Ms Murphy, who ran The Red, White and Blue pub in Portsmouth, Hampshire, bought games through a Greek satellite broadcaster Nova for £800 a year instead of Sky, which was then priced at £700-a-month. The Premier League took legal action against her Mrs Murphy and she was fined £8,000 for dishonest reception of a television reception in 2006. But a European Court of Justice ruling said having an exclusive system of TV rights was contrary to EU law and the High Court overturned her conviction. A recent investigation by trade publication, The Morning Advertiser, quoted a pub landlord saying Sky Sports cost him £16,000-a-year, compared to the £300-per-year of screening it illegally. The decision came after Portsmouth landlady Karen Murphy won a European court battle over her conviction. Despite the ruling, the Premier League can still take pub owners to civil courts over breach of copyright .","Landlord was convicted and fined for showing Albanian footage of games .

"The Irish Football Association is hoping that structural damage at its Windsor Park home in Belfast will not jeopardise the staging of the team's crucial Euro 2016 qualifier against Romania in June. Cracks in the structure of the West Stand were spotted on Tuesday morning and the area was sealed off as structural engineers carried out an assessment of the damage. 'The Irish FA became aware on Tuesday morning of some damage having been caused overnight to the West Stand of the National Football Stadium at Windsor Park,' an IFA spokesman told the Belfast Telegraph. Northern Ireland's Windsor Park suffered overnight damage to its West Stand on Monday night . 'The association is currently awaiting a report from the structural engineers.'

"A football fan is facing a three-year ban after running topless onto a pitch and performing a series of somersaults during his first ever game at the stadium. Charlie Sumner, 20, staged a one-man pitch invasion at Reading's Madejski Stadium during the team's FA cup quarter final replay with Bradford City last month. The Reading supporter, whose team were 3-0 up at the time, did four front flips on the pitch, landing on his back each time, before being tackled by stewards. Charlie Sumner, 20, staged a one-man pitch invasion at Reading's Madejski Stadium during their quarter final replay with Bradford City last month (pictured) The Reading supporter, whose team were 3-0 up at the time, did four front flips on the pitch, landing on his back each time . Sumner - who said going to his first game was a 'brilliant experience - is now facing a potential three-year ban for carrying out the stunt. The order, due to be decided on April 30, would stop him going to all Reading's future home and away matches. Today, Sumner, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said he has no regrets about the incident, saying that he had done it for 'laugh' and that his family had 'seen the funny side'. Speaking outside court, he said: 'After doing it and seeing good comments and messages, even from the away fans, I don't look back and regret it. 'Obviously I wouldn't inform other people to do it. It was just spur of the moment. It's good to see good feedback and not negative feedback. 'I'd had a few drinks, I was happy and Reading were winning and I just went for it and had a laugh. It was brilliant.' Asked whether he goes to many Reading matches, he added: 'That was my first game actually. It was a good experience. Obviously being there on the first game - not after what I've done, but standing in the stadium, watching the game from the stadium - it's a brilliant experience. 'Obviously with the ban, I wouldn't be able to experience that experience again.' Charlie Sumner, pictured outside Reading Magistrates' Court today. He is facing a potential banning order . After running onto the pitch, Sumner was tackled by stewards. The footage of Sumner's antics went viral . The incident took place on March 16, when the match was being broadcast live to millions of viewers on BBC One. Afterwards, footage of Sumner's antics also went viral on the internet. Sumner, who went to the match with a group of eight friends, said he talked with his friends in a taxi on the way to the match about potentially running on to the pitch. 'I did say no at first. Then Reading were winning and I got a bit excited,' he said. 'I went to rave on Friday and there's another video on Facebook and I'm doing flips there. I've had a few selfies, a few drinks bought for me.' Sumner said he spoke to friends on the way to the stadium about carrying out the stunt. He said he had no regrets and that his family had seen 'the funny side' But Sumner, who works as a dry liner fixing ceilings, said he thought a potential football banning order 'seemed a bit much.' 'I don't want a three year ban because obviously it's quite a bit,' he said. 'I'm not encouraging people do it and if I go to another game, I'm not going to do it again.' At today's hearing, Sumner's solicitor entered a guilty plea on his client's behalf to one count of going on to a playing area at a football match under the Football Offences Act 1991. Sumner, who was at court but missed his hearing after leaving the building briefly, was released on bail with conditions that he does not attend Reading's home or away matches. He will appear at Reading Magistrates' Court on April 30 when a decision will be made on whether he receives a football banning order.","Charlie Sumner, 20, invaded pitch at Reading's Madejski Stadium in March .

The Bosnia international has regularly been linked with other clubs during his time at the Britannia Stadium, and although his current deal has just over 12 months to run, Scholes believes they can match the 27-year-old's ambitions.

"Five days before college sweethearts Brittany Huber and John Redman were to wed last May, a horrific car crash on a Georgia highway killed the young bride and left her fiance clinging to life. Redman survived, but his body was left shattered and he was told by his doctors that he was likely to spend the rest of his life in a nursing home, confined to a wheelchair. The future looked bleak for the 25-year-old assistant basketball coach at Dalton State College, but against overwhelming odds Redman recovered, and on March 24 he helped lead his team to a championship title. Tragic couple: Brittany Huber and John Redman were involved in a deadly car crash just days before their wedding last spring. The bride to be was killed on impact and the groom was left clinging to life . Bittersweet moment: Eleven months later, Redman, assistant basketball coach at Dalton State College, helped lead his team to its very first championship title. Sadly, Huber was not there to celebrate with Redman . Victory: The Dalton Roadrunners beat Westmont College of California 71-53 in Kansas City on March 24 - 11 months after Redman's (third from the right) accident . 'To me, it was almost a relief,' Redman told Al.com of the win - the team's first since it has become eligible to take part in the championship. 'I had such a long year personally. ... It was very emotional in more ways than anybody could understand.' But for Redman, standing on the court in Kansas City and celebrating the Dalton Roadrunners' first-ever NAIA championship victory - they beat Westmont College of California 71-53 - was a bittersweet moment because his biggest cheerleader, Brittany, was not there. 'Now I realize more and more each day what I learned from her and what I learned from that whole situation so yea, good things can happen from bad things,' he said. The past 11 months have been the most challenging in John Redman's life. On April 28, 2014, Redman was driving his future wife from Dalton, Georgia, to her hometown of Mobile, Alabama, when he lost control of his Lexus in a rainstorm. The car blew a tire, hydroplaned and smashed into a bridge column on Interstate 85 in Merriweather County, Georgia, killing the 23-year-old bride in impact. Inseparable: The couple had been together since 2011 and were just five days from their wedding . Wreckage: They were driving from Georgia to her hometown of Mobile, Alabama when Redman lost control of his car and smashed into the median, killing his fiancee on impact . 'I don't remember the accident at all,' Redman told 11 Alive. The young basketball coach was rushed to a hospital and spent more than two weeks in a coma with five broken ribs, three surgically removed ribs, 21 skull fractures and eight broken teeth. 'They [doctors] told my parents I'd be in assisted living the rest of my life... that I'd never come back to work. I'd be in a wheelchair. I might never talk again,' Redman recalled. After a month in the hospital, Redman finally asked to see Brittany for the first time since the accident. 'I was mad at her because she hadn't come to visit me. I'm in the hospital, she hasn't visited me one time,' he said. That is when Huber's parents broke the devastating news to Redman that his wife-to-be didn't make it. Redman and Huber had been together since the fall of 2011, and the couple got engaged in June 2013. In July of that year, then-23-year-old graduate of Spring Hill College was hired as assistant men's basketball coach at Dalton State. His fiancee worked as a kindergarten teacher’s aide at City Park Elementary School. Huber had a severe hearing impairment since she was a girl, but her students and people who met her for the first time often couldn’t pick up on it because of her uncanny ability to read lips . Hanging by a thread: Redman survived the crash but was left with a cracked skull and broken ribs, and was told he would likely spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. For the first month in the hospital, he had no idea that Huber has died . Miracle: Against overwhelming odds, Redman recovered and was able to walk out of the hospital and resume coaching (pictured) On the eve of their fateful road trip to Mobile, Brittany wrote on her Instagram page: ‘I can't wait to ride on this journey with him and see what our amazing God has in store for us.’ Just hours before her death, Huber posted a photo of their journey, with the caption: 'It is finally wedding week!' The church where the couple were due to marry on May 3 was instead the venue for her memorial service. Seven women wore matching mint green dresses - their bridesmaids dresses - to the service,AL.com reported at the time. John Redman says he felt Brittany's presence in the hospital every day, as always cheering him on. 'I felt Brittany was there the whole time, and she was telling me to get up, get out, you don't want to be here, go live your life,' he recalled. And that is exactly what Redman did, to the surprise of his doctors who called his recovery a miracle. Back on the court: Redman (far right) started out slowly, working part-time at Dalton a couple of hours a day . Smiling again: Redman said that working with the team, including assistant men's basketball coach Tony Ingle Jr (left), was a form of therapy for him . 'When you hear a doctor say you're a miracle, you probably are a miracle, they don't use that world very easily or lightly,’ he told WRCB. After weeks of physical therapy, Redman resumed coaching. He started out slowly, working part-time a couple of hours a day and using his time with the team as a form of therapy. 'Just having something to look forward to, and something to do, it's given me hope, made me excited again. They saved my life,' Redman said. That is why for Redman and the Roadrunners, winning the title for the first time since Dalton launched its basketball program two years ago was more than a sports victory. ‘It really has been the best year and the worst year of my life,' Redman concluded.","Brittany Huber, 23, was killed on impact when fiance John Redman, 25, lost control of his Lexus in Georgia April 28, 2014 .

"Lucas (left) and Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard during Sunday's All-Star charity game at Anfield . Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva is looking to recapture what he considers his best form in two years after recovering from injury. The Brazil international enjoyed a run of 16 starts in 19 matches from late November - which coincided with a marked improvement in the team's results - until a groin problem in February's Merseyside derby saw him miss 10 games. He was an unused substitute in the defeat by Manchester United immediately before the international break, their first in the league since mid-December, but played 90 minutes in Sunday's All-Star Charity game at Anfield. Lucas's return to fitness could not have come at a more opportune moment, with captain Steven Gerrard suspended for three matches for his sending off against United, and the Brazilian is hoping to slot back in seamlessly after injury halted what was turning into a good season personally. 'I was in a very good moment, probably the best moment in the last couple of years, and I had a good run of games,' he said. 'The beginning of the season wasn't good for me because I couldn't play much, but as soon as I got back in the team I think I helped a lot. 'I don't know if Stevie's suspension will change things because the team were playing well, but I need to be ready and there are a lot of games to play and the FA Cup as well, so everyone will be needed. 'I need to be ready and if I get a chance again I need to be at the same level I was before I was injured.' Lucas attempts to spoil Luis's Suarez's return to Anfield with a tackle in the charity match . Fifth-placed Liverpool head to Arsenal on Saturday knowing they cannot realistically afford to lose if they are to keep pace with the top four, but in addition to Gerrard's absence they will also be missing centre-back Martin Skrtel, a virtual ever-present this season, after he was retrospectively banned for standing on United goalkeeper David de Gea. 'Martin is having a fantastic season again. He has been a very consistent player for us and losing him and Stevie is hard to take, but if you want to be successful you can't rely on one or two players,' Lucas told liverpoolfc.com. 'Both are very important players for us as one can change a game and the other gives us stability at the back, but we have other players as well who can step in. 'It's always been the case for the group that if someone gets injured then someone will step in and do the job. 'That's how it should be and we shouldn't be afraid we don't have them. 'Of course it's going to be a big miss not having Stevie and Skrts, but we have to show we can cope for the three games and then we have them back ready to go again.' Lucas's spoiling in midfield helped Liverpool go on an impressive run before Christmas . The Brazilian is aiming to take advantage of Gerrard's absence in he next three games . Lucas rejected the chance to have some time off during the international break in order to make sure he was fully fit for the resumption of the Premier League. 'I feel great. Leading up to the Manchester United game I had a full week of training as well, so it's been two weeks of full training,' he said. 'I was available for the Manchester United game, but probably wasn't able to play the whole game. Now I feel 100 per cent. 'Of course it's good to have a few days off, but I was away in Brazil while I was having my treatment so it was the right decision to stay here and keep working during the international break. 'If you get too many days off you don't get the sharpness and the rhythm of the training session and that's what I was missing. 'I spoke with the staff and they prepared everything for me as well to make me feel as though I'm in good condition, so it's looking good and hopefully it will only get better. 'Now it's just a question of getting some minutes and training sessions, so that's what I need and what I'm having. 'Leading into the Arsenal game that's going to be good, because I will have had three full weeks of training and I'm looking forward to it.'","Lucas Leiva is set for run in Liverpool first team after groin injury .

"Tom Boyd believes Jason Denayer’s loan spell at Celtic has been so successful that he is now ready to challenge for a place at Manchester City next season. Such an outcome would obviously deny Ronny Deila’s stated aim of retaining the young Belgian for another year, yet Boyd also sees a clear positive. To the former Celtic captain, Denayer’s development can act as a perfect advert to encourage more emerging talents to take their next career step at Parkhead. Young defender Jason Denayer (left) has impressed on loan at Celtic this season . The 19-year-old recently won his first international cap for Belgium in a Euro 2016 qualifier against Cyprus . The 19-year-old earned a first full cap for his country when he came off the bench in their 1-0 win in Israel on Tuesday night following a red card for Vincent Kompany. Denayer will hope to join Kompany in City’s first-team squad when he returns to his parent club this summer and Boyd feels he is equipped to take that step. ‘Jason certainly looks like he could go back to Man City and make an impression,’ said Boyd. ‘For a young boy, he’s been exceptional. He looks a lot older in his play and it surprises you when you remind yourself how young he actually is. ‘The only question is whether he will get the opportunities he wants down there. I think he will, especially now that he is featuring for Belgium in a qualification game. ‘Unfortunately, Celtic can’t compete with the money on offer in England. The new television deal down there has taken things to another level again. ‘I’d love Jason to stay at Celtic for 10 years but that’s not going to happen. He’s an ambitious boy and wants to go and challenge himself to be the best he can. From some of the games I’ve seen, I think he could slot into that City defence no problem. Denayer has been tipped to partner Belgium team-mate Vincent Kompany (left) on his return to City . Denayer has formed a successful partnership with Dutchman Virgil van Dijk (left) at Parkhead . ‘However, hopefully his success will help Celtic bring more youngsters in. Previously people said you move to England to get international caps. Jason and Fraser Forster showed that’s not the case. ‘Hopefully Celtic can say, “Come here and you will progress” and use those examples to attract players.’ Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that Hearts captain Danny Wilson is one central defensive candidate under consideration by Celtic as they look a potential additions for next term. ‘Good players attract attention and Danny has been playing very well for Hearts,’ said Boyd. ‘He is certainly someone who was very promising as a young boy and is hopefully getting back to that level.’ The current partnership between Denayer and Virgil van Dijk has formed the foundation of Celtic’s bid for the Treble – a feat the club last achieved in 2001 when Boyd was skipper. Manager Ronny Deila should be able to attract rising youngsters to the Hoops, claims Tom Boyd . Celtic are considering a bid for Hearts defender Danny Wilson to shore up their defence . While some will point to the absence of a competitive Rangers from the top-flight, the ex-Scotland international is adamant a domestic clean sweep this term would be the equal of his achievement under Martin O’Neill’s management. ‘A Treble this year would stand beside the other three in Celtic’s history,’ said Boyd. ‘You have to beat what is in front of you. ‘There have only been three in Celtic’s history and that tells you how hard it is to achieve it. ‘If they do get the Treble, there should be the same adulation as when my team won it in 2001 and Jock Stein’s team did it twice. ‘It would be a fantastic achievement if Scott Brown was collecting the Scottish Cup to complete a Treble. ‘The League has been a challenge with Aberdeen doing so well, although I think the pressure will eventually tell. ‘You can’t take away what Celtic have achieved so far and sometimes the difficult part of the Treble is winning the cups. ‘Celtic have had a terrible record in the League Cup over the years and that shows how hard it is. ‘I’d like to see the talking done when they have two in the bag and are preparing for the Scottish Cup final. ‘Ronny’s approach is new. He’s spoken about the Treble from the start but it does show the level of confidence he has.’ Former captain Boyd insists a treble for Celtic this season will equal his own three-way success from 2001 . Boyd was speaking at Hampden as he launched the search for nominees to be inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. The 49-year-old has a very decent claim himself, but would be delighted if figures who operated behind the scenes were recognised. ‘Professor (Stewart) Hillis, who passed away last year, and other Scotland backroom guys who maybe aren’t as well-known would be very deserving of being in there. ‘Jimmy Steele is another one who contributed a lot with Celtic and the national team - and I think that would be a great gesture if they were inducted.’ Fans can make nominations by logging on to sfmhalloffame.co.uk. Inductees will be announced at a Hampden dinner on October 18.","Young Belgian Jason Denayer has impressed on loan with Celtic .

"Antonio Conte insisted his return to Turin for Italy's 1-1 draw against England prompted 'very fond memories', despite reports he received death threats in the days leading up to the friendly. Former Juventus manager Conte replaced Cesare Prandelli as Italy boss in August after the Azzurri's World Cup group-stage exit last summer, but his first seven months in charge of the national team have been topsy-turvy. Italy required a late goal from Eder to rescue a 2-2 draw against Bulgaria last Saturday and Conte reportedly received death threats from Juventus fans after Claudio Marchisio suffered a knee injury on the eve of the Euro 2016 qualifier.

"Ian Murray reckons a supposedly easier run-in can swing second place Hibs' way ahead of Rangers in the last month of the Championship season. His Dumbarton side have faced both of his former teams in the league this term and will do so once again  in the final weeks of the campaign. But while Stuart McCall's men have the momentum at present - beating Hibs and Cowdenbeath while Alan Stubbs' men also lost to Raith - Murray wouldn't be surprised to see the balance of power swing back towards Easter Road before long. Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes that Rangers will struggle to maintain their pace through the run-in . Rangers - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners Hearts, including Sunday's match at Ibrox, while the Leith side take on their city rivals just once more. HIBS: April 4 Queen of the South (h); April 8 Dumbarton (a); April 12 Hearts (h); April 22 Livingston (a); April 25 Alloa (h); May 2 Falkirk (a) RANGERS: April 5 Hearts (h); April 9 Queen of the South (a); April 12 Raith (h); April 15 Livingston (a); April 18 Dumbarton (a); April 25 Falkirk (h); May 2 Hearts (a) 'Rangers got a good result against Cowdenbeath last Saturday to keep themselves in contention and I think it's going to be close but I still believe Hibs have the easier run-in,' said Murray. 'They do have tough games as well including one against Hearts and if they're serious about finishing second, they need to beat the likes of ourselves and Queen of the South at Easter Road this Saturday. 'The derby will take care of itself. I think it's going to be really tight and I can't see either side going through the rest of the season undefeated. Both will drop points. 'But the fact Rangers play Hearts twice and one of those games is on the final day of the season doesn't help them. With Hearts getting the trophy at Tynecastle after that match, it doesn't do them any favours as that's a game Rangers might need to win. 'Hibs were favourites to finish second for a while after they beat Rangers 4-0 at Easter Road then 2-0 at Ibrox and because of the lack of form Rangers were showing. Both wins were comfortable and suggested Hibs had overtaken Rangers. Although they've been pegged back since, I still think Hibs are slightly ahead.' Rangers' attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, scores against Cowdenbeath at Irbox . The team finishing second face a potential four games to get back into the top flight, while the third team have a potential six. Murray's Dumbarton team are virtually assured of a place in next year's second tier thanks to a 14-point lead over second-bottom Cowdenbeath and could become mathematically safe this weekend after they play Jimmy Nicholl's strugglers on Saturday. But the 34-year-old is adamant his side will still have plenty to play for as they look to have a say in who goes up and down. Murray added: 'We'll play Cowdenbeath and Alloa which is obviously huge for them at the bottom of the table. 'We still have to go to Queens and we've got Rangers and Hibs at home so we've got games that are meaningful for others. 'There's no pressure on us at all now so we can go out and play with a bit more freedom and be a bit more relaxed than normal. 'But it won't be a case of us not turning up. We want to get as big a gap as we can between ourselves and the relegation places.'","Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes Rangers' tough run-in could mean they miss out on second place in the Scottish Championship to Hibernian .

"A sprawling rural estate - complete with a Grade II-listed manor house and five cottages - is on the market for £6million. Set in 200 acres of land near Bridgnorth, Shropshire, the Chyknell Hall Estate also boasts a swimming pool, tennis court, stables - and even its own cricket green.

The owner will also be set up for entertaining with a wine cellar, four-oven Aga, loggia, library and billiard room.

The estate, described as the 'pinnicle of the residential tree', offers 57 acres of woodland and more than 500 acres of adjoining sporting rights, including game shooting. The land also planning permission for five more properties, should the new owner wish to expand. The ownership of Chyknell Hall Estate can be traced back to medieval times and this is only the third time in its history it has been on the market. It remained in the same family for generations before it was sold to a family in the 1930s. The current owners bought it four years ago. The estate is now being sold by estate agents Knight Frank for offers over £6million. Clive Hopkins, head of estates at Knight Frank, said: 'This estate is a package that ticks most boxes. 'You've got a listed Regency house that has been refurbished to a high standard but kept traditional features, set in some wonderful compartmentalised gardens which means as you walk round the house you get a different type of garden depending on what window you look out.

Secluded: The sprawling manor, pictured, is set in traditional parkland which has no footpaths through it - offering complete privacy . 'That's then set in traditional parkland which is very private and secluded. There's no rights of way or footpaths through it, which is very rare for a house of that age. 'Rights of way originated from footpaths being made for staff working in a big country house to get back to their village so it's very rare for a house of this stature not to have a path. 'It's a really big draw in this day and age, owners want privacy but don't want to be too remote. 'This estate has no road noise, no light pollution and no pylons. It's a package which is very rarely found and is highly sought after. 'It would suit someone looking to buy the next stage of house, an estate like Chyknell is the pinnacle of the residential tree.

"Two college campus police officers in Dallas have been placed on administrative leave after shocking video footage surfaced of them harassing a group of four students and arresting one after first hitting him. The incident occurred at El Centro College and was captured on cell phone by student Charles Adams, who was smoking a cigarette when he witnessed the abuse at first hand last Wednesday. The officers approached the high school students while they were waiting for a bus outside the downtown Dallas campus. Scroll down for video . Two college campus police officers in Dallas have been placed on administrative leave after shocking video footage surfaced of them harassing a group of four students and arresting one after first hitting him . The footage shows the young men being ordered to face a brick wall, while one of the two campus cops searched, questioned, and even hit one of the teens. The school reportedly won't say why the teens were stopped and frisked, but Adams said he believes the officers totally overreacted. 'Instead of asking them to move along like she should have, she told them to put their hands against the wall, and that's where the video picks up,' Adams told WFAA. 'I was horrified the way she was treating these kids as criminals for nothing.' His cell phone video, which surfaced on You Tube, shows one of the students being slapped by an officer before she handcuffs him. 'I've got a lot of stuff on my belt I could use on you this afternoon. I guarantee you I will be glad to use it,' she is heard saying to another of the group. The school reportedly won't say why the teens were stopped and frisked, but the student will filmed the incident has said he believes the officers totally overreacted . She also asked them if they had any dope on them and then proceeds to search their pockets and grab at their clothes. El Centro College President Jose Adames has said a full investigation is underway. 'In this case we decided to do a thorough investigation, and place two officers on leave because of the interactions we saw in the video,' he told CBS DFW. The college has said it is seeking an opinion from the Texas attorney general and isn't releasing the police report because the subjects in the incident are minors. The school has 10,000 students and is part of the Dallas County Community College District. The incident occurred at El Centro College and was captured on cell phone by student Charles Adams, who was smoking a cigarette when he witnessed the abuse at first hand last Wednesday .","The officers have been placed on administrative leave after shocking video footage surfaced of them harassing a group of four students .

"One of the biggest fixtures on the German footballing calendar takes place this weekend, although some of the usual gloss has been taken off a game recently baptised Der Klassiker. Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich have shared the last five Bundesliga titles between them and Bayern are set to continue their domestic domination this term. This time, however, the two giant antagonists of the German game meet with 31 points and nine positions separating them in the standings, but that does not mean the stakes are not as high as they always are when these two clubs meet. Jurgen Klopp (centre) celebrates with his Borussia Dortmund players after their victory against Hannover . Dortmund are now only five points from the top six having climbed their way from the foot of the table at the midway stage of the season to 10th, although their coach Jurgen Klopp insists their league position after the Klassiker is not his biggest concern. 'We've got to try to beat Bayern and where that can take us in the league is secondary,' Klopp said. 'Although we're 10th, and although there's a huge points gap between us, and although a lot is different compared to the past, it's still a Borussia Dortmund home game. 'I don't recall us gifting any of these games in the past. Dortmund's Jakub Blaszczykowski (right) challenges Hannover centre back Christian Schulz . 'Gladbach have shown us how it's done. Wolfsburg have also beaten them, but it's not all that easy.' Victory would nevertheless be important for Dortmund if they are to close the gap on the top six and qualify for Europe next season, while a second consecutive defeat for Bayern is almost unheard of and it would allow Wolfsburg to reduce the deficit at the top to seven points. The Wolves host bottom-placed Stuttgart on Saturday while third-placed Borussia Monchengladbach can strengthen their grip on a place in the Champions League with a win at Hoffenheim. The battle at the bottom of the table is intensifying with all of the bottom eight sides separated by just seven points and still in danger. Xabi Alonso cuts a cool figure during Bayern Munich's training session on Thursday . Hamburg reacted to their slide into the bottom three by appointing Peter Knabel as their new coach during the international break and his first game is a daunting trip to fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen. The northern Germany side therefore risk coming out the other side of the weekend inside the bottom two with Paderborn travelling to Hertha Berlin on Sunday. Freiburg and Cologne are also involved in that scrap and they meet on Saturday with Mainz travelling to Werder Bremen. Elsewhere, Augsburg host Schalke on Sunday and Eintracht Frankfurt welcome Hannover and their under-fire coach Tayfun Korkut to the Waldstadion.","Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich have shared the last five Bundesliga titles between them .

"Gordon Robson, 26, killed grandfather John Potts, 45, with a single punch to the back of the head that was so hard it made an 'audible crack' A thug who was drunk after his grandfather's funeral killed a devoted father with a single punch after he stepped in to break up a fight outside a sports bar. Newcastle Crown Court heard that Gordon Robson, 26, hit father John Potts, 45, in the back of the head so hard there was an 'audible crack' before he fell down dead. Robson, who has a history of violent offending, was jailed for just three and a half years for the attack outside the NE38 Sports Bar in Washington, Tyne and Wear, in November last year. The court was told that Robson had been drinking at the bar after being a pallbearer at his grandfather's funeral before getting into an argument with a friend of Mr Potts. Fighting broke out after the bar closed, and Mr Potts, a father-of-six and grandfather-of-one who was described by his sister as 'a big softie', stepped in to stop it. Prosecutor Nick Dry told the court: 'At this point the defendant punched Mr Potts, who had been trying to calm matters down and was actually facing the other way when the blow was struck. 'The punch made a loud crack, witnesses turned to see him falling to the ground, making no attempt to break his fall.' The court heard despite intervention from the emergency services, Mr Potts could not be saved. Mr Dry added: 'Mr Potts had been minding his own business. He was an innocent bystander who sought only to calm the situation down.' Mr Potts' widow Sarah said  his death had a 'devastating impact' on the family. She said Mr Potts' stepchildren and eight-year-old daughter, Emma, now fear their family won't come back whenever they leave the house. Mr Dry added: 'She said he was a father who never judged her, he was just her dad and hero.' Mr Potts' sisters said in their statements the 'life and soul has been ripped from their family' and described their brother as a 'big softie'. Mr Potts' brother George said he wakes every Sunday at 5.30am, the time he was informed of his siblings death, and feels life has been changed forever. Robson had been drinking at the NE38 Sports Bar in Washington, Tyne and Wear, after his grandfather's funeral when fighting broke out. Mr Potts, described as a 'big softie', was killed when he tried to intervene . Judge Paul Sloan QC jailed Robson, of Waskerley Way, Washington, Tyne and Wear, who admitted manslaughter, to three-and-a-half years behind bars. The judge told Robson: 'Mr Potts was trying to calm the situation. He was acting as a peacemaker. 'It is clear Mr Potts was a devoted father and step-father. It is also clear his death has had a profound effect upon his family. 'No sentence imposed upon you could ever serve to ease the pain of Mr Potts' family. 'I accept you are genuinely remorseful and I accept you will carry the guilt with you for the rest of your life for what you did that night.' Robson accepted he 'misinterpreted' Mr Robson's actions that night, when his already emotional state had been heightened by alcohol, and realises now he should not have hit him. Bob Spragg, defending, said Robson, who has a history of violent offending dating back to when he was just 14, had turned his life around after his last prison sentence . He added that Robson had also found himself a partner who is about to give birth. Mr Spragg said: 'Absolutely no blame attaches to Mr Potts for anything that happened to him. 'Once the defendant has served his sentence he will return to being a law abiding citizen but will have to live with what he has done for the rest of his life.'","Gordon Robson, 26, was drinking at NE38 Sports Bar, in Tyne and Wear .

"Scoring against your old team, and executing a perfect set-piece from the training ground are two of the most satisfying things in football. For Notts County star Ellen White, Thursday night was a night to remember as she managed both at the same time against Arsenal in the Women's Super League. In the 26th minute, with County having been awarded a free kick on the edge of the box, Laura Bassett and Alex Greenwood appeared to mess things up, the former almost running into the latter. Laura Bassett and Alex Greenwood almost run into each other, causing confusion at the free kick . Ellen White spins on the edge of the box and fires the free kick into the corner against her former club . As the Arsenal defence relaxed, the ball was shifted for White, who span and smashed it into the corner against the club where she spent three seasons. 'Thankfully it came off,' White told BBC Radio Nottingham. 'But now we can never do it again, which is a little annoying.' 'We have been working on things a little bit differently in pre-season. I'm pleased it went in because I've skied it over the bar and it has gone wide, but thankfully that one went in.' However, White also missed a penalty which would have made it 2-0, before Arsenal hit back to equalise late on and rescue a point.

"We spend a third of our lives asleep, but most of us don't pay attention to what our mind and body actually need during these resting hours in order to feel refreshed every day. The Sleep Health Foundation have released a study reporting that 30 percent of Australians complain about their lack of sleep on a daily basis. According to Chair Professor David Hillman, those misplaced hours of sleep must be paid back in order to be functional for the entire week. A study has outlined that 30 percent of Australians complain about their lack of sleep on a daily basis . The average adult needs around eight hours of sleep per night with a range of seven to nine . The average amount of sleep for an adult is around eight hours, with a range of seven to nine, the ABC have reported. Any less than six hours or any more than 10 hours is unusual for the standard person. Professor Hillman added that our sleep pattern is influenced by how much we are willing to compromise from the work week. 'A lot of us pay back a bit of that debt on the weekend but I think it's possible to exist in a sort of tolerable, sleep-restricted state,' he said. 'In other words you're not optimal, but you're still functional.' Pushing these sleep-debt boundaries can lead to micro sleeps in certain people. Therefore, the hours must be paid back to avoid an error rate in alertness tasks. Any less than six or any more than ten hours is unusual for the standard person . If power napping, it is important to get no more than 20 minutes or inertia will set in . In relation to a sleep schedule, Professor Hillman said the eight hours per night does not necessarily need to be consecutive. 'Interestingly enough, your slow wave sleep, is in the first four hours,' he said. 'Most adults, the most convenient way our particular society is organised is to have your eight hours in a continuous block overnight but that's not a necessary thing.' If choosing to break up your eight hours of sleep, napping throughout the day is the answer. Professor Hillman advises 20 minute power naps to avoid falling into deep sleep and suffering from inertia which makes you feel temporarily worse off. 'The longer naps, you get the sleep inertia but ultimately once you've got up, they sustain you better,' he said. Professor Hillman has also advised that if you are waking up tired and fatigued it could be due to sleep apnoea which is often associated with snoring.","The Sleep Foundation study has shown that adults need 8 hours of sleep .

"Everyone is watching Valencia’s 19-year-old left back Jose Luis Gaya with Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea hoping to snatch him from under Real Madrid’s nose this summer. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson takes a look at the Spain under 21 defender. Why are English clubs so keen? His buy-out clause is currently set at £13.5m. When you consider that Luke Shaw – of a similar age and potential – cost £27m it would be silly not to be interested; although there would be also be reservations about his suitability to the Premier League. Jose Luis Gaya (right) in action for Valencia during a La Liga match with Sevilla earlier this season . Reservations? He flies forward very much in the style of Jordi Alba and Juan Bernat. But those two left-backs who came before him at Valencia are in sides that allow them to play at times as auxiliary wingers – one at Barca and the other for Pep Guardiola at Bayern. There would be more defensive duties in England and he would be tested in the air. He has plenty of spring and good technique but at just 5ft 7ins it is not his strong point. Basically, you’re saying he can’t defend… . No, not at all. He is lightning fast and that enables him to recover position very quickly as well as correct his own, or his team-mates’ mistakes. He is also tenacious in the tackle – and aggressive enough to come out on top against bigger players. And he is 19 so a coach such as Mourinho would be able to improve him defensively. But what is indisputable is that his natural inclination is to attack. Gaya is an attack-minded left-back who likes to get forward at every opportunity . And he is very effective going forward? Much like the aforementioned Bernat and Alba, and Liverpool’s Alberto Moreno, he grew up playing as a winger before gradually been moved back to full-back. He’s not just an overlapper, he’s very good off of both feet and can make runs inside to play through-balls or shoot. He also played as central striker before being moved wide and as an 11-year-old whose idol was David Villa, he scored 60 goals one season in Valencia’s academy. Spain already seem to be well-stocked at left-back so will he make it to the senior first team? He has represented his country at every level since under-16s and has tended to benefit every time Juan Bernat has moved up an age category, stepping into his place. He is currently first choice for the Under-21s. Of course at senior level everyone stops moving up and as good as he is it will be hard for him to shift Alba and Bernat ahead of France 2016. Gaya slides in on Atletico Madrid midfielder Arda Turan during last month's match in Madrid . Does he want to leave Valencia? He has supported the club all his life. Hour-long trips from his home in Alicante to train with them since age 11 have helped ingrain that affection but there is a reason why he has still not signed a new deal that would increase that £13m buy-out clause. If the offer is right and from the right club then he is ambitious and he will go. Will he come to England? Valencia would rather do business with an English club than Real Madrid. But if the buy-out clause is met then there is little the club can do about deciding where the player goes. He’s 20 in May and staying in Spain will be appealing. At Madrid he will be just three hours away from his family and friends on the East coast. He will want some guarantees at Madrid however. Marcelo is first choice at the moment so how many games will he actually play? A club like Arsenal could come in and promise far more first-team football which might sway him but Madrid are favourites. Gaya, pictured here at the 2013 Under 20 World Cup, has represented Spain up to under 21 standard . Gaya (left) talks to team-mate Federico Vico during an under 19 international against Germany . Real Madrid bought Danillo this week and now they want Gaya. And they already have Dani Carvajal and Mareclo. Are they building a team of full-backs? Reserve full-backs Alvaro Arbeloa and Fabio Coentrao have been identified as two of the weaknesses of the squad. They want Danillo and Carvajal contesting the right back position next season, and Gaya and Marcelo the left-back spot. Coentrao and Arebeloa will both be sold in the summer. There is also a Fifa investigation into their signing of under-age youngsters currently ongoing. With a potential transfer ban hanging over them they want to cover every gap in their squad.","Gaya has been linked with a number of big clubs in Spain and England .

He said: 'We all know what he has done over the years but when people are putting their hands in their pockets to fork out money, they want to know they are getting value.

"Celtic's ambitions of persuading Manchester City to release Jason Denayer for another loan deal at Parkhead next season are well documented. But what you wish for and what you get are often oceans apart and so may be the case regarding Denayer after the pronouncements from City on Thursday. Put simply, manager Manuel Pellegrini has confessed that his club's young Academy players are not yet ready to step into his first-team squad. Therefore the likes of Denayer may soon find themselves returning from loan deals to fill the gap. Jason Denayer has impressed while playing for Celtic on loan this season from Manchester City . Celtic are keen to retain the services of the 19-year-old  Belgian defender, but face an uphill struggle to do so . City manager Manuel Pellegrini has confirmed that the club are looking to invest in homegrown talent . Pellegrini's comments confirm that City will be required to invest heavily in 'homegrown' talent this summer. Current Premier League regulations require clubs to carry a minimum eight homegrown players, a group which can include youngsters who have spent three of their formative years at an English club. Denayer falls into this category despite hailing from Belgium - making him all the more attractive to City next season. Pellegrini said: 'I think about the Academy, we must be patient. This club build all these things because young players are important. 'Maybe it's not so easy for young players, especially at big clubs, to play in the first team, with the professional squad. 'I'm sure in the future we will have very important players coming from the Academy, they will be part of the squad. 'But it's important to be patient, important to have years of working the same way. But you never know. Maybe some talented young players can do it before.' Denayer would obviously fit the bill.

"Southampton boss Ronald Koeman will wait for a more accurate date for Fraser Forster's return before deciding whether an additional goalkeeper must be signed in the summer. Forster underwent knee surgery after falling awkwardly in the 2-0 victory over Burnley a fortnight ago and estimates for his comeback have ranged from four to 12 months. Koeman is reluctant to give a more precise time frame for the England international and views Kelvin Davis as a capable deputy, although he admits he may be forced to bolster his goalkeeping options if Forster's recovery is delayed. Fraser Forster suffered a serious knee injury in Southampton's match with Burnley a couple of weeks ago . The England goalkeeper has undergone surgery but will certainly be out for several months . Manager Ronald Koeman would not be drawn on whether Southampton will sign a new keeper in the summer . 'Fraser is down, of course. I spoke to him last week,' Koeman said at his press conference ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Everton. 'The operation he had last week went okay, but he will be out for a long time - at least for this season. We have to wait to see how long he will be out for, it's difficult at this moment. 'Fraser is a fantastic goalkeeper. He was and is the number one for us. But as for every player you need good substitutes for each position. 'Kelvin Davis is a very experienced goalkeeper who played very well against Burnley. Koeman said he will wait for further updates on Forster's condition before making the decision . Kelvin Davis will deputise for Forster until the end of the season . The Saints still retain an outside chance of making the top four and reaching the Champions League .

'We have to make a decision on the goalkeepers at the end of the season and if Fraser is out for a longer time, a new goalkeeper is an option.' Striker Jay Rodriguez has been missing for a year to rehabilitate his own knee complaint and Koeman has revealed that he could be back before the end of the season. 'Jay has been training with the group and should be ready to play in four or five weeks,' Koeman said.

"Rotherham boss Steve Evans was left fuming on the sidelines after his relegation-threatened side were denied a penalty in their narrow Sky Bet Championship defeat at Birmingham. The hosts had led through first-half goals by Robert Tesche and Clayton Donaldson, before Matt Derbyshire pulled one back for fourth-bottom Rotherham. However, Rob Kiernan's clumsy handling of Derbyshire near the hour mark saw the former City forward go down in the box only for referee Dean Whitestone to wave away appeals for a spot-kick, leaving the Millers boss visibly enraged as the home side held out. Robert Tesche of Birmingham City celebrates scoring the opening goal of the game . Tesche (centre) finished low to put Birmingham City ahead against Rotherham at St Andrews .

Andrew Shinnie was unfortunate to be flagged offside from Donaldson's early flick-on while winger Demarai Gray's ball into the box from the left was dangerous but fruitless. David Cotterill forced a good low save from Emiliano Martinez with a drive from just outside the area in the 19th minute as Gary Rowett's side continued to press. The deadlock was broken in the 27th minute with a well-worked but uncomplicated attack. Tesche found space just outside the box and after a one-two with Donaldson, side-footed coolly into the bottom-right corner to leave Martinez with no chance. Shinnie headed Cotterill's excellent cross over in the 38th minute after Donaldson's slight touch beforehand slightly changed the flight of the ball but eventually the second did come two minutes before the break. Cotterill hit a free-kick from distance with trademark power and accuracy and when Martinez palmed it back into play, rather than for a corner, Donaldson pounced with an easy diving header.

Birmingham City's David Cotterill holds off challenge from Rotherham United's Ben Pringle (right) Donaldson fired a decent effort over on the turn as Blues sensed blood before the half was over. Rotherham gained a foothold less than three minutes into the second half, however. Slack defensive play left City goalkeeper Darren Randolph in bother and when he only palmed Lee Frecklington's shot to Derbyshire, the deficit was halved as the striker tapped home with ease. Frecklington then had a chance saved as Randolph kept out a deflected effort, while Martinez reacted quickly as Donaldson broke through at the other end. Colourful Millers boss Evans was incandescent with rage on the hour mark when his side were denied a penalty, with Derbyshire bearing down on goal only to go down when tangling with home defender Kiernan as the centre-half looked to atone for an error seconds earlier. Derbyshire was not far off with a 76th-minute header, while Donaldson and substitute Lloyd Dyer both came agonisingly close at point-blank range and Tesche twice fired straight at Martinez as the home side missed numerous chances to make the win more comfortable.","Robert Tesche and Clayton Donaldson struck in first half for Birmingham .

"The worry for Virgil van Dijk is obvious. Holland’s national team have already conceded more goals in five Euro 2016 qualifiers than they lost in the entire qualifying campaign for the last World Cup. And still Guus Hiddink never calls or writes. The Celtic defender made it into two squads last year. But one step forward is usually followed by two steps back. When the Dutch were drawing 1-1 with Turkey the other night he was sunning himself in the Arabian Gulf and bumping into club-mates instead. Virgil van Dijk has been in fine form for Celtic but wasn't rewarded with a call-up to the Holland national team . Van Dijk's last call-up to the Dutch side came last year though he has never been capped by his country . ‘I saw Stuart Armstrong and Callum McGregor,’ he says in deadpan fashion. ‘The better players were with their national teams. I was in Dubai.’ A holiday in Dubai is rarely a cause of self-pity. Yet van Dijk’s gripe is obvious. His breakthrough to the national squad was short-lived and he can’t shake the nagging belief that he might have a better chance of playing for his country if he performed in a more respected league than the SPFL. Celtic boss Ronny Deila denies this, using Jason Denayer’s Belgium debut against Israel by way of a counter argument. ‘I don’t think the Belgian national team is any worse than the Dutch,’ he insists. ‘Right now, it is better. So I don’t think that is the answer. ‘I don’t know the level of the other central defenders in Holland, but they must be very, very good to be better than Virgil, in my opinion.’ Van Dijk’s rivals for Hiddink’s attentions are Stefan de Vrij, Bruno Martins Indi, Jeffrey Bruma and Joel Veltman. None are superstars. But they play in Italy, Portugal or Holland. All three leagues have a better reputation than the SPFL and the worry for Celtic is that van Dijk knows it. Van Dijk says he was happy for team-mate Jason Denayer,  who made his debut for Belgium against Israel . ‘Yes, I think that’s maybe one of the big reasons,’ says the defender. ‘They don’t take the (Scottish) league too serious. I don’t know what the reason is, but until then I just need to keep working and hopefully get a call-up. ‘Nobody asks the manager (Hiddink) or his staff either why I’m not getting a call-up. For me, the only thing I can do is play well for Celtic, work hard and prove myself day in and day out. ‘I’ve watched most of the games, including the highlights from the Turkey game last week. Sometimes you hope you get a chance. But until that day will come, it’s just for me to work hard and win games for Celtic and prove myself. ‘If I’m in the national team it would be a big bonus because it’s only like last season that I’ve been playing okay and I’ve tried to continue that this season. If I get a call-up then great.’ Through any disappointment he could find a silver lining in being overlooked once more. ‘It was a little bit disappointing when the squad was announced,’ he concedes. ‘But the day I knew I was getting a week off was a better day, I think. ‘My feeling is I needed this break a lot. I’ve never played so many games in a season as I have this year so far and the travelling is also quite hard at time, mentally. ‘I needed a nice break with the family away to get some rest and to be ready for Friday. I’ve been to Dubai and got some nice sun and relaxation.’ Ronny Deila believes the standard of Scottish football makes no difference to Holland's decision-making . There is no envy of his friend and defensive partner Jason Denayer. The 20-year-old was called into the fray for Belgium after Vincent Kompany was sent off in midweek, playing half an hour for his homeland. ‘I’m very happy for him,’ insists van Dijk. ‘He is a good friend of mine now and I’m very happy he made his debut. It was a good day for him.’ Whether either player will still be at Celtic next season is impossible to say. Van Dijk plays questions with a straight bat. As all footballers must, he insists he thinks little of transfer matters so long as there are trophies to play for. ‘I speak to my agent almost daily,’ he reveals. ‘But he’s more than an agent to me, he’s also become a very good friend. ‘He knows exactly what I want and what I don’t want to hear. So, we have a very good relationship and that remains that way. ‘I don’t think about all that at the moment, not at all. I think about the Treble. ‘We have one cup now and the other two are close, so I want to win both of them and write some history. That’s all I’m thinking about. I’m not thinking about this is going to be my last season at the club or anything else.’ Van Dijk leaves the field after being sent off against Inter Milan in the Europa League in February . Like van Dijk, his coach Deila also took a holiday ahead of Friday night’s clash with St Mirren in Paisley and the final stretch of the domestic season. ‘I was in Marbella for a week, 25 degrees in the sun,’ says the Norwegian. ‘So that was good. I needed that. ‘I switched off. It was a good week. Of course you are always thinking a little bit and watching the international teams, what’s happening there, but it was a very, very good week. ‘I’m ready now and looking forward to Friday. ‘It’s our possibility to take some days off - because during the season you play three times a week so there’s never a chance to do anything. When we have international team breaks, we have 70 per cent of the squad away on duty. It’s good to use those periods.’","Virgil van Dijk was on holiday in Dubai while Holland played two games .

"Celtic have hit out at the SFA over ticket prices for their Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness later this month at Hampden. The game's governing body has already come under fire from Caley Thistle fans for scheduling the match for 12.15pm on Sunday, April 18 - before the first trains from Inverness arrive in Glasgow. Now the Parkhead club have made their feeling known after ticket prices were set at £23 for the North and South stands, with the East Stand being £15 for adults and £5 for concessions. Celtic have complained to the SFA over ticket prices for their Scottish Cup semi-final at Hampden this month . In a statement, they said: 'Celtic Football Club is extremely disappointed with the ticket pricing for our forthcoming Scottish Cup semi-final match against Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Celtic argued strongly that the pricing for North Stand tickets should be reviewed and lowered, to be brought closer to prices for other parts of the stadium. 'As in previous years, due to Celtic supporters being in the vast majority, a huge number of our supporters will be required to pay a ticket price which we believe is too high. 'Clearly, we feel that SFA and other Clubs involved should have taken a common sense approach to this matter in the interests of fairness for our supporters and to ensure attendances at the matches are as high as possible.' The SFA responded: 'The Scottish FA notes Celtic's statement on ticket pricing for the forthcoming William Hill Scottish Cup semi-finals and can clarify the following: All four participating clubs were consulted on ticket pricing for the semi-finals; the semi-final ticket prices have been unchanged for the past four years; the Scottish Cup semi-final gate, broadcast and advertising revenues for both matches are aggregated and distributed evenly to the competing teams, minus a 10-per-cent levy.'

"Rangers interim chairman Paul Murray insisted on Thursday night the actions of previous boardroom regimes were ‘solely’ to blame for the club’s stock exchange removal. The Ibrox outfit will be forced to delist from the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) after being unable to secure a new nominated advisor (Nomad) to meet regulations. Murray insists the new board’s plans for the future will be unaffected and that planned investments will still take place. Rangers interim chairman Paul Murray insists the actions of previous boardroom regimes were ‘solely’ to blame for the club’s stock exchange removal . However, the development has reopened old hostilities, with Sandy Easdale claiming the shareholder group he heads is considering legal action. The former football board chairman also accused Dave King of making ‘misleading’ statements. Trading in Rangers shares was suspended when previous Nomad, WH Ireland, resigned just two days before the March 6 EGM that ousted the old board and handed control to King and his allies. Discussions between incoming directors and a potential Nomad replacement were already underway at that point. It’s understood, however, that they subsequently broke down after the AIM hierarchy indicated a wish to dispense with Rangers altogether, unhappy at the level of turmoil witnessed since its initial listing in December 2012. The club was the subject of more complaints than any other company on the market over the past 12 months. The Ibrox outfit have not disclosed the name of the Nomad with whom they held talks but are adamant the firm was happy to approve chairman-in-waiting King and all current directors as ‘fit and proper’. King and the Three Bears consortium are expected to be among the investors in a new share issue this summer to provide a longer-term financial solution at the club. Rangers now plan to be listed on the ISDX market, which Arsenal currently use, by the end of next month. London firm JP Jenkins will provide an interim service for those seeking to buy or sell a stake in the club. ‘We tried everything within our power to have the suspension lifted but it was clear that we would have to pay a price for years of poor corporate governance and financial mismanagement since the IPO (in 2012),’ said Murray. ‘The delisting is down solely to the actions and conduct of past regimes. ‘You could say the behaviour of previous directors has poisoned the well with AIM but even so we might have expected a little more understanding from certain quarters. However, I must point out that delisting will have no effect on our overall financial strategy. Murray insists the new board’s plans for the future will be unaffected by the stock exchange removal . ‘The investments we expect will still be made and Rangers will be rebuilt on schedule. Be certain that this delisting, which is down entirely to the actions of previous boards, will have no bearing on future investment. ‘It is unfortunate our intended Nomad, who had confirmed to us that they cleared all of the individuals concerned as fit and proper, could not proceed after having conducted due diligence on the company but I want to stress again that this will not hinder our plans.’ King had stated the day before the EGM that he intended to appoint the Nomad he had lined up ‘immediately’ but added the caveat that the firm would have to look ‘under the boot’ at Rangers before accepting the position. The fact none has been appointed led  to an outcry from the Easdale camp, which controls a 20 per cent stake in the club. ‘I can confirm that the Easdale grouping is considering legal action,’ said a spokesman. ‘This cessation of listing is a blow to all serious shareholders and is in direct contradiction to the promises Mr Dave King made in the lead up to the EGM regarding appointment of a nomad.’ Easdale was later asked by Sky Sports News whether he felt King had misled supporters, replying: ‘I think, categorically, we have been misled. Dave said in several interviews that he had a Nomad and felt comfortable that the company would still be listed.’ On the subject of potential legal action, Easdale said he didn’t think the group would ‘be taking Rangers to task’ but could look ‘more on a personal basis, with the individuals who misled the shareholders in thinking shares would still be on AIM’. Fan ownership groups have, however, backed King and the new board. ‘It is clear that some who remain supportive of the previous regime are attempting to portray this issue as being a broken promise by the new board,’ said a spokesman for the Rangers Supporters Trust. ‘We do not adhere to that view and do not believe it stands up to any sensible scrutiny. We are entirely satisfied that the new board has done everything it could to maintain the AIM listing and we are happy that they did not in any way mislead shareholders by stating that they had a Nomad willing to work with them. ‘It was made clear by the new board that any Nomad’s involvement would be subject to due diligence on the company itself. In fact, we are aware that more than one Nomad was willing to clear the current and prospective directors as fit and proper. The only barriers to a continued listing have been the reputational damage done by the complete absence of corporate governance of previous boards and the reluctance of the AIM regulator to allow a new Nomad to take position.’ A statement from Rangers First added: ‘The delisting is simply the result of well-documented failings in corporate governance and management of those who previously controlled the Company. ‘In addition, we note positively that an alternative listing is being sought and that an immediate solution has already been put in place from Tuesday that will allow buying and selling of RIFC PLC shares.’","Paul Murray insists old board are to blame for stock exchange removal .

"Wayne Rooney and his England team-mates were upset by the sloppy, uninspired way they started in Italy on Tuesday night. Nine months on from meeting at the World Cup, the Three Lions faced the Azzurri once more in a glamour friendly at the Juventus Stadium. Hopes were high after seven straight wins but Roy Hodgson's men struggled in the first half, deservedly falling behind to a Graziano Pelle header in Turin. England captain Wayne Rooney issues instructions during the 1-1 draw against Italy on Tuesday night . Rooney said he and the rest of the England players were upset by their first half performance . However, half-time brought with it renewed enthusiasm and England dominated the second period, levelling in style through Andros Townsend and going close to turning a 1-1 into an away triumph. 'We have (moved on from the World Cup) and I think that's why we were so disappointed with the first half,' England skipper Rooney said. 'We know we're better than that. Even though we had a lot of changes, we know we are a better team than what we showed first half. 'We were upset, I'll be honest, in the dressing room after the first half. Everyone was upset with the way we performed. Rooney and the rest of the England squad arrived back from Italy on Wednesday after their flight was delayed . The squad were supposed to fly home on Tuesday night after the match but a technical fault caused delay . 'It showed great character from everyone to go out in the second half to put in the performance we did, to get back in the game and were unlucky not to go on and win it. 'Italy are a great team and I think one of their biggest strengths is seeing the game out. 'We worked hard, we pushed the ball well, showed a lot of composure on the ball and created chances. 'On another night we might have scored another goal, but I think overall probably a draw for both teams was a fair result in the way the game went.' Graziano Pelle opened the scoring as England deservedly went behind in the first half against Italy . Andros Townsend equalised for Roy Hodgson's side during a much-improved second period . Things certainly ended positively for England, with Rooney dovetailing well with full debutant Harry Kane as Hodgson's second-half introductions stated their case. Ross Barkley was one of the stand-out performers, with the second-half substitute showing flashes of the form which impressed so many last summer. 'Ross is a terrific player,' Rooney said. 'He is a terrific young player and I think he can have an impact when he comes on. 'He did that, he took the ball, he ran at the Italian defenders and made it difficult for them. 'Hopefully, he can kick on now for the rest of the season.'","England drew 1-1 against Italy in friendly at Juventus Stadium on Tuesday .

"Dundee United have hit back at fierce criticism of the board's performance by two leading supporters' groups. Arabtrust and the Federation of Dundee United Supporters Clubs say they are 'shocked' that 25 per cent of £6.3million worth of transfer fees for Ryan Gauld, Andrew Robertson, Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven were paid in commission to unnamed parties. The supporters groups also disputed chairman Stephen Thompson's alleged level of investment in the club. The Dundee United board have hit back at criticism from supporters by pointing to their on-field success . The Tannadice club - already under fire for selling Armstrong and Mackay-Steven to Celtic six weeks before their League Cup final defeat to the Scottish champions - responded by defending their record in a statement. It read: 'All supporters can be assured that the board will continue to implement its professional and comprehensive strategy for the football club. 'This strategy and the related actions of the chairman and board of directors have delivered progress both on and off field. 'On the field the club has reached back-to-back domestic cup finals for the first time in 29 years, qualified for European competition in three of the last four years, finished in the Premiership top six in every one of the last seven years and won the Scottish Cup in 2010. 'The current management team and players are also sitting fourth in the Premiership this season with sights firmly set on securing a European qualification place.' The supporters' joint statement expressed concern over the levels of club debts, saying: 'Despite the sales of the four players the board of DUFC does not believe that this is yet sufficient to pay all current remaining debt.' Defending their record on that point, the club statement responded: 'Off field the board has reduced overall debt, including Thompson family loans, from £5.2m in February 2014 to £2.6m while successfully extricating the club from all bank debt. The club debt is projected to be reduced to £1.4m by the end of this year. 'Supporters can rest assured that the board is comprised of individuals that are, without exception, Dundee United supporters. They bring with them a wealth of experience in business. 'At all times, the board acts to promote the success of Dundee United and will continue to do so.' Arabtrust and the Federation also voiced concerns that chairman Thompson was wary of bringing in external investors for fear of seeing his family's shareholding drop below 75 per cent. The most explosive allegation, however, is the claim concerning the commission paid to outside parties – none of whom are understood to be players, agents or other clubs. The supporters' joint statement added: 'We believe this figure to be in excess of £500k. This does not include payments to players, agents or other clubs. When all of these various payments are totalled, over 25 per cent of the £6.3m in fees received has not been kept in the club.' United last year announced that a recent debt settlement would see the Bank of Scotland collect a share of transfer fees received before the end of August 2015. A United spokesman said: 'We've been reluctantly drawn into this matter and have no wish to enter a war of words, but the £500,000 figure is an entirely fictitious amount based on an incorrect assumption. At no time was that figure provided to anyone, so it's surprising to see it in the public domain.' Some supporters were angered by the amount of commission that was paid from transfer fees received .","Dundee United have faced criticism from fans over the 25 per cent commission paid out from £6.3m worth of transfer fees received .

"Gary Locke will be confirmed as Kilmarnock’s permanent manager on Friday - exactly eight weeks after he was asked to take charge until the end of the season. An announcement will be made by the Rugby Park club on Friday morning, with the former Hearts boss being given a three-year deal. And on Thursday the 39-year-old paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour with new chairman Jim Mann since he replaced Allan Johnston on a caretaker basis in February. Kilmarnock will confirm Gary Locke as the club's new permanent manager on Friday . ‘I’d be over the moon to get it as it’s something I’ve worked hard towards,’ said Locke while negotiations were being finalised at the Ayrshire club. ‘I had a taste of it (management) at Hearts and really enjoyed it. I’m fortunate I was put into this position at a great club. It’s a fantastic opportunity. ‘But I’ve said all along, it’s not about me. It’s about players. If they perform, you get a better reputation as a manager and that has been the case here with a great response from them. ‘That’s how football works. If they play well, your stock rises. Equally, if they don’t play well, it’s the manager who gets the stick. ‘I’ve got broad shoulders and I know what to expect but I can’t praise the players highly enough. They have worked so hard and they have taken on board everything I have tried to tell them.’ Ex-Killie and Hearts player Locke, who was crestfallen not to be retained by the Tynecastle club as head coach after they were relegated last season, added: ‘(Coaches) Alan Robertson and Billy Thomson have done a fantastic job in helping me, too. ‘You can’t do all of these things by yourself and backroom staff can be as important as the players. I can’t thank all of these people enough.’ Locke, who returned to Rugby Park last summer, had been working as No 2 under Johnston when the manager announced in February that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season, indicating that the £150,000 sale of teenage forward Robbie Muirhead to Dundee United had been a factor in his decision. After Johnston was immediately relieved of his duties by the club hierarchy, assistant Locke was put in charge and was initially regarded as a stop-gap appointment. But he quickly won over the players and a team that had previously been struggling in the league went unbeaten in their first six games under his stewardship. They only suffered their first reverse under Locke when Ross County beat them 2-1 in Dingwall two weeks ago. Kilmarnock went unbeaten during Locke's first six games in charge of the club . He has impressed Mann not only with results but with the way he has conducted himself during his two months at the helm. Kilmarnock are currently eighth in the Premiership and still remain in the hunt for a top-six place. It was expected that Locke would have been appointed permanently before now, but he dismissed reports that talks had stalled due to a clause that would see him sacked if the club failed to achieve a top-six finish this season. ‘When you are dealing with contracts, they take a bit of time and I certainly don’t foresee any problems,’ he said. ‘There hasn’t really been a hold-up. As any player or manager will tell you, when it comes to the terms of a contract, it doesn’t just happen overnight. There are a lot of things to discuss and I have done that. ‘I will keep all that private because that is the way it should be and the club have dealt with it brilliantly. ‘I’ve no complaints there, so I hope it will be sorted before Saturday and I can concentrate on our home game against Motherwell. ‘Our new board of directors have been fantastic. I’ve been really impressed with the way that they have handled everything. The club itself is trying to be as positive as possible. ‘There are a lot of plans in place to make the club even better than it is right now, so there are loads of positives and I would like to be part of that.’ Having resolved his own situation, Locke will next week turn his attention to the futures of nine first-team players at Kilmarnock — Manuel Pascali, Alexei Eremenko, Craig Slater, Craig Samson, Sammy Clingan, Greg Kiltie, Conor Brennan, Chris Chantler and Mark O’Hara — who will become free agents this summer. ‘I’ve said for a number of weeks now that once my own position was sorted out, there are a few players out of contract and they will want to know what their futures are,’ he said. ‘So it will be great to get moving on all of that and prepare for next season. ‘You can’t do that until you are the main man.’","Gary Locke will be confirmed as Kilmarnock boss on Friday .

"Hull KR have plugged the gap created by the loss of front row pair Michael Weyman and Ryan Bailey with the capture of experienced Australian forward Dane Tilse from Canberra Raiders. The 6ft 7in, 17st-plus Tilse has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with the Robins and will join them as soon as he receives the necessary paperwork after the Raiders agreed to release him. Tilse, 30, who has made 200 appearances Down Under, will link up with his old Canberra team-mate Terry Campese, the new Hull KR captain who on Tuesday signed a two-year contract extension, and is a like-for-like replacement for Weyman, who announced his retirement due to injury last month. Australian forward Dane Tilse will move from Canberra Raiders to Hull KR on a two-and-a-half-year deal . The Raiders have agreed to release the 6ft 7in forward and only paperwork delays his start for the Robins . Rovers, who have appointed former England captain Jamie Peacock as their football manager for 2016, were further depleted in the front row when they agreed to release ex-Leeds prop Bailey for personal reasons. Tilse comes in after the sudden retirement of Michael Weyman and Ryan Bailey's departure . Hull KR head coach Chris Chester, who had been linked with a move for Tilse's Canberra team-mate David Shillington, said: 'It's no secret that we've been short on numbers in the front row after the departures of Mick and Ryan Bailey and we wanted to strengthen in that area. 'Our forwards have coped very well in the circumstances but we've been scouring the market for props and we're delighted to be bringing in someone of Dane's calibre. 'He's got a very good pedigree over in the NRL and he's coming here in what should be the prime of his career for a front rower. 'We're excited to see him take to the field for us and he'll be a big part of the squad moving forwards. We've got to go through the necessary process regarding his visa, but we're hopeful of having him on board in the next three to four weeks.' Tilse, a former Junior Kangaroo who was an ever-present for Canberra in both 2013 and 2014, said he spoke to former Hull KR hooker Josh Hodgson, who joined the Raiders at the end of last season, before finalising the move. 'It's a new challenge for me to come over there and it's one I'm really looking forward to,' Tilse said. 'Everybody I've spoken to has had good things to say about Rovers and it sounds like a club on the way up. 'I've had a brief chat to Josh Hodgson and he spoke very highly of the club, as did Mick Weyman's dad. I played with Mick at Canberra and his old man said how much he'd enjoyed it over there. Tilse will link up with his former Raiders team-mate Terry Campese, the new Hull KR captain . 'It's a different style of game in Super League, it's not so much about the wrestle and defence like the NRL, so I'm looking forward to a fresh start. 'I've been at Canberra for 10 years now and it's time for me to be taken out of my comfort zone, but I'm 30 years old, I'm an experienced player and I'm more than confident I can handle the change. 'I was already thinking of coming over to Super League next season, but this was too good an opportunity to turn down. 'Canberra have been really good with me, so hopefully I can play a couple more games here over the next few weeks and then get across to Hull KR.'","Michael Weyman and Ryan Bailey's sudden departures left huge void .

"Livingston boss Mark Burchill believes heartbroken midfielder Darren Cole wants to play in Sunday's Petrofac Cup final despite the game coming just a week after the tragic death of his cousin in America. The ex-Rangers youth has been mourning the loss of Shaun Cole, 22, who was found dead in a Miami street last weekend and is thought to have been the victim of a hit-and-run driver. A soldier who had served in Afghanistan, he was on holiday in Florida while on leave and had attended a music festival there before being found on a pavement with a head injury which proved fatal. Livingston boss Mark Burchill is hopeful that midfielder Darren Cole will turn out for his side on Sunday . Livingston star Cole, 23, was close to Shaun and paid tribute to the army private on his Twitter account this week. He wrote: 'I know you won't be here for the rest of our lives but I can promise I'll love you for the rest of mine.' Cole was granted time off by the Championship side as they prepare to face Alloa at McDiarmid Park in their first national final in 11 years. But he returned to training on Wednesday and is due to work with the players again after a squad day off on Thursday. Burchill is not putting any pressure on the 23-year-old to play despite the fact he has been a key member of the team since signing a short-term deal in February. He will give Cole as much time as he needs to grieve and accept whatever decision he makes - but admits that the former Murray Park youngster has given the impression he would like to be involved. Burchill said: 'Darren was away from the club initially and we don't really know what to expect but I am speaking with him constantly to plan with him. 'He came back to training on Wednesday but is still in a bit of shock after what has happened, which is completely understandable. 'If I'm honest, I really don't know if he is going to play so we will need to see how things go once we get towards Saturday and Sunday. 'I think Darren would like to play but he has never been through something like this before in his life. 'Him and Shaun were much closer than a lot of cousins are. They grew up together, were around the same age and lived in the same area. They were best mates. 'Darren and his family want to find out exactly what happened and get a wee bit of closure because they still don't know the circumstances. 'We will do everything we can as a club to keep his head straight. It goes without saying we would like him to be involved and I think he would like to be. 'He is a very aggressive central midfielder and is technically one of the best players at the club with two fantastic feet.'

"Alan Smith has rubbished claims that Liverpool fans attacked the ambulance he was travelling to hospital in following the aftermath of his horror injury during Manchester United's FA Cup 1-0 defeat to their fierce rivals nine years ago. Smith suffered a broken leg and a dislocated ankle while attempting to block a John Arne Riise free-kick during the fifth round clash at Anfield in February 2006. At the time of the incident, reports circulated that Liverpool fans tried to disrupt Smith's journey to hospital by throwing bottles, beer glasses and stones at the ambulance as well as rocking the vehicle. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Alan Smith has denied claims that Liverpool fans attacked the ambulance he was travelling to hospital in during Manchester United's FA Cup fifth round exit nine years ago . The horror incident occurred after Smith (second right) blocked John Arne Riise's free-kick . Smith suffered a broken leg and a dislocated ankle as a result of the incident at Anfield . But Smith, who made his comeback for United seven months later, insists that was not the case. 'It didn't happen – fans were still in the ground,' he told FourFourTwo exclusively in the May edition of their magazine. 'I went back to Liverpool a few years later with Newcastle and had a great reception. 'I had loads of mail from fans after the injury, including a lot from Liverpool. And Liverpool's medical staff were great. They were worried that because there was no blood flowing that I could have had a club foot. 'It wasn't Riise's fault and he came to see me. The dislocated ankle was worse than the leg break because I snapped ligaments and there were complications. 'I knew I was never going to be the same player. I've appreciated every game I've played since that injury, I know how close I was to being finished.'

"Ronny Deila  has confirmed Hearts captain Danny Wilson features on a list of Celtic’s summer transfer targets. As Sportsmail revealed on Tuesday, the Scottish champions are considering a £400,000 offer for the former Rangers and Liverpool defender. Wilson has 12 months left on his current contract, with Hearts owner Ann Budge insisting the newly-promoted Edinburgh club have no need to sell. Hearts captain Danny Wilson (right) is a summer transfer target for Celtic and could be signed for £400,000 . The defender is out of contract at the end of the season but Hearts are in no rush to sell . With Celtic battling to keep hold of current pairing Virgil van Dijk and Jason Denayer, however, manager Deila admits Wilson is among the potential central-defensive reinforcements being considered. ‘He (Wilson) is one of many names we are looking at,’ the Norwegian conceded. ‘I know all about him, of course. He is a good player but there is nothing in that right now. We are looking for central defenders. That is an important target because of Jason [Denayer] and also because of the situation with Virgil. Hopefully we will keep him.’ Van Dijk has attracted the attention of Sunderland and Southampton while on-loan Denayer will return to parent club Manchester City after making his full international debut for Belgium this week. Desperate to hold on to both ahead of Champions League qualifiers which could potentially be worth £16million to the club, Deila added: ‘First of all, Virgil is our player. He will stay. That’s what we want, to have him through the Champions League. ‘He is so important to us. He still has things to work on to become even better. His chance will come in the future - but he is one of the players we really want to keep. Celtic will face a challenge to keep hold of the services of highly-rated Dutch defender Virgil van Dijk . John Denayer is expected to return to Manchester City after an impressive loan spell in Scotland . ‘Virgil is the leader in the defence, so he is vital for us. Any money we could get for Virgil can’t compare with the money we would get from the Champions League. ‘Jason is a young player, a very good player as well. It is easy to get one player in for him, but not so much if we need two. That’s a totally different thing. I was delighted for Jason he got 30 minutes for Belgium. Again it shows to other players we are doing something right here, that he has come from not playing an important match, ever, to now playing in the first team for Belgium. That’s credit to him and for us as well.’ Repeating the view that Denayer should stay at Celtic to play European football rather than risk a return to the Manchester City reserves, Deila insisted: ‘I think it’s important for him to play, that’s why we sent Liam Henderson to Rosenborg because he needs playing time. I don’t know if he will play or not, I think he will, but it’s a very good experience for him, playing at a big club, with pressure. And the level is hopefully a little bit lower than here and he will get that experience. ‘It’s the same for Jason. City is so hard to play for, if he gets in there he is a world-class player. He is still only 20 so I think he should get more experience here. As it is now, he is going to go back to Manchester City for pre-season.’ PSV winger Zakaria Bakkali is another target for the SPL champions and is available on a free transfer . Budge, meanwhile, insisted that Hearts’ good financial health means there would be no need for them to let Wilson go on the cheap. ‘We have been successful and there will be interest in our players and management team,’ she admitted. ‘But am I confident we can hang on to the majority of the people we currently have. ‘We are in a good bargaining position. We have a fantastic base on which to build and I hope we can hold as much of that as we can. ‘That said, it is a commercial world out there and if someone comes long and offers someone something hugely substantial, then who knows?’ As well as Wilson, Deila admitted Celtic are also trying to tie up players on pre-contract agreements. PSV Eindhoven’s Belgian winger Zakaria Bakkali is one Bosman target, Deila saying: ‘We have three players we are thinking of on Bosman but we haven’t agreed anything with anyone.’","Celtic are considering a £400,000 move for Hearts captain Danny Wilson .

"Ronny Deila insists Celtic will not risk their Champions League aspirations by embarking on another gruelling pre-season travel schedule. The Norwegian blamed last summer’s money-spinning programme of games in the United States, Austria, Germany for a damaging 4-1 qualifying defeat to Legia Warsaw. Celtic command lucrative fees for pre-season commitments and have also taken on trips to Australia and the Far East in recent seasons. Ronny Deila and Nir Bitton walk off the pitch after losing to Legia Warsaw in Champions League qualifying . A return to America for this July has not yet been ruled out. With £16million on offer just for returning to the Champions League group stages, however, Deila says he has the blessing of chief executive Peter Lawwell to scale down this summer’s commitments. ‘It is not going to be the same,’ he said. ‘We are going to play less games, travel less and really prepare for those games. ‘I want to do it differently than we did it last year. I think we did way too much travelling and way too much games.’ Faced with over-turning the 4-1 first leg defeat in Warsaw last summer, Deila remained with his first team in Glasgow while a Celtic development squad suffered a 6-1 thrashing to Spurs in an exhibition game at Helsinki’s Olympic Stadium. ‘It is not positive to play games with half a team and lose 5-1 and 6-1,’ said the Celtic boss. ‘It is not positive for the confidence and the atmosphere in the club. We don’t like to lose. When we play we want to prepare as well as possible and that is going to be the main issue now in pre-season.’ A Celtic development squad were thrashed by Tottenham in a pre-season friendly last season . The SPFL champions recently secured a new kit deal with American manufacturers New Balance, raising the chances of a return to the States. Despite the financial attractions of a packed pre-season programme, however, Deila says he has backing from Lawwell to do most of the preparation in Scotland. ‘He is with me. We are on the same lines so that hasn’t been a problem. We are talking about the United States but then everything has to be perfect there. ‘We haven’t decided 100 per cent but I think we are going to stay here for the first 14 days and have games around here. We will have a couple of games that we go away to play, maybe two or three. So less travelling, more calm. Players will have been abroad on vacation and will come back and prepare the right way and play games here.’ Acknowledging at the same time that overseas trips generate cash for the club, Deila responded: ‘Yes, but there is more money in the Champions League.’ Deila says Celtic won't be travelling as much in pre-season as they look to qualify for the group stages .","Celtic travelled to the United States, Austria and Germany last pre-season .

"Franck Ribery has dismissed reports linking Wolfsburg forward Kevin de Bruyne with Bayern Munich as a potential replacement for the former France international or his team-mate Arjen Robben. De Bruyne, who spent his two years at Chelsea largely on loan before joining the second-placed Bundesliga club, has scored nine goals this season and is topping the league's assist charts with 16 – seven more than the next best. But Ribery says despite his impressive form the 23-year-old Belgian is the wrong style of player to come in under Pep Guardiola because he has different assets to himself and the Holland winger. Kevin de Bruyne is linked with Bayern Munich as a potential replacement for the club's veteran forwards . The Wolfsburg playmaker, here in action for Belgium against Israel, has 16 assists and nine goals this season . Bayern's Franck Ribery says despite De Bruyne's impressive form he is the wrong type of player for Munich . 'He is not a player who takes the ball and dribbles forward and likes to have the opponents in front of him,' Ribery told German publication Sport Bild. 'De Bruyne is great, when he fits the counterattack. At Bayern, however, you usually only have three or four metres in front of you, not a lot of room. But he is a good player and he is still young, so he can still learn.' Ribery and Robben's contracts run out in 2017 and both have endured injuries worries of late prompting reports that an injection of youth such as 23-year-old De Bruyne could be good for the club. Ribery (left) says De Bruyne's counter-attacking skills don't mesh with the style of Pep Guardiola (right) Ribery has struggled with injuries of late and has been linked with moves away from the Bundesliga leaders . Should Bayern be in the market for a young attacker, however, Ribery knows precisely who he'd want to see at Allianz Arena – De Bruyne's Belgian team-mate Eden Hazard. 'He attacks all of the time. He loves to run at his opponent,' he said. 'But he plays at Chelsea - this could be very expensive for Bayern.' If Bayern do go for De Bruyne, against their outspoken veteran's advice, they'll have competition from Manchester City, who have met with his representatives, along with Paris Saint-Germain. Wolfsburg are said to be keen to hang onto him for at least one more campaign that should include next season's Champions League. Chelsea's Eden Hazard would be an ideal fit with Guardiola and the Allianz Arena, says Ribery, but expensive .","Chelsea flop Kevin de Bruyne has been linked with Bayern Munch .

"The girlfriend of an Arizona State University football player who has been suspended after she accused him of abuse has now publicly recanted her story, claiming that mood swings made her lie about being assaulted. Davon Durant, a promising linebacker at ASU, was arrested on domestic violence charges after his girlfriend of 18 months, Kelsi Langley, claimed that he hit her in the face and grabbed her neck during an argument in his car March 7. Following his arrest, Durant, a transfer from a Kansas college and a five-star recruit, was suspended from the football team indefinitely and could be facing expulsion. She said, she said: Arizona State University football player Davon Durant (left) was arrested last month on domestic abuse charges, but his girlfriend Kelsi Langley is now saying that he never struck her . Speaking out: Langley, an ASU student, held a press conference on campus Tuesday declaring that her boyfriend is innocent, and that she lied about the assault because she was jealous . Less than two weeks after the incident, Langley walked back her previous statements in interviews with reporters, and on Tuesday afternoon she held a press conference that she claims set the record straight. Standing on ASU's campus alongside civil rights leader Reverend Jarret Maupin, the 19-year-old Ms Langley said her earlier assault story was ’completely made up' and Durant was innocent. ‘I was angry. I'm a woman. Women have mood swings,’ Langley said. ‘We had gotten into an argument about girls trying to talk to him and I was really jealous of that,’ reported AZ Central. Davon Durant pleaded not guilty to one felony count of aggravated assault and three misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct. According to a police report, Kelsi Langely suffered a bruise below her left eye and there were visible finger marks around her neck. The 19-year-old refused medical care and declined to help with her boyfriend’s prosecution, according to Temple police. During Tuesday's press conference, Langley and Maupin pointed a finger of blame at the local police and the media, accusing them of trying to make Durant out to be 'some big black athlete' and blowing a lovers’ quarrel out of proportions. The 19-year-old woman said that during her interview with police after the March 7 incident, officers asked her questions that were 'almost suggestive.' Who's lying? According to a police report, Kelsi Langely suffered a bruise below her left eye and there were visible finger marks around her neck - but the student said the neck bruises were love bites and her eyes were red from crying . Rising star: Following his arrest, Durant, a transfer from a Kansas college and a five-star recruit, was suspended from the football team indefinitely and could be facing expulsion . Blame game: Langley and civil rights activist Jarret Maupin accused Temple, Arizona, police and the media of falsely portraying Durant as a thug and his girlfriend as a helpless victim . Maupin said Langley returned to the precinct the next day and withdrew her complaint. She also posted Durant's bail. 'These aren't the actions of someone who has been severely abused or lives in fear,’ the civil rights activist told reporters. Ms Langley insisted that she does not want to be portrayed as a victim 'because that's not the case at all.' ‘He never laid a finger on me,’ she stated. ‘Davon would never touch me. There's no way. He's the kindest person I've ever met in my entire life. He couldn't hurt a fly, and it was my anger that got the best of me. she's got his back: Langley posted Durant's bail after his arrest and recanted her story the following day . ‘Everyone's been in a relationship, everyone gets into arguments, and a lot of people say things that they don't mean.’ However, a 911 recording released by police to Fox 10 Phoenix appears to corroborate Langley's original statement. A witness called police March 7 telling a 911 operator that he had seen a man beating a girl in a car. The caller said other people also witnessed the altercation. But Langley insisted that the witness was wrong, and that their dispute never turned physical. She now wants all charges against Durant dropped. In her first conversation with detectives, Kelsi Langley reportedly described how she got into an argument with Durant and told him she wanted him to leave, reported AZFamily.com. The football player then allegedly demanded that Langley go up to her apartment with him so he could retrieve some of his belongings, but the woman refused. That is when Durant allegedly struck her in the face and squeezed her neck. In his version of events, Durant said he had a verbal dispute with Langley in his car. ‘When I lied to the police, it was out of spite,’ Langley told ESPN a week and a half after the incident. ‘I wasn't thinking. It was a very vengeful and spiteful thing to do.’ During the interview, the ASU student said that the bruises on her neck were ‘hickeys’ and her eyes were red from crying. ‘I already knew I had marks on my neck, and I knew I could pass them off as something,’ she said. Maricopa County Attorney's Office has released a statement saying: ‘In domestic violence cases it is especially important to avoid placing victims at the center of evidentiary disputes outside of the court process.","ASU linebacker Davon Durant, 19, was arrested last month after he allegedly hit his girlfriend of 18 months in the face and choked her .

"Eden Hazard has admitted an intense campaign with Chelsea may have left him too tired to perform at the best of his ability after he was substituted just 62 minutes into Belgium's win over Israel on Tuesday. Hazard has played 48 games this season for club and country, missing just five matches for Chelsea and being an ever-present in their Barclays Premier League title charge. But as Belgium struggled to a hard-fought 1-0 win over Israel in European Championship qualifying group B, Hazard was withdrawn by manager Marc Wilmots with 28 minutes to go having found it difficult to get the better of his marker Orel Dgani. Eden Hazard has admitted an intense campaign with Chelsea may have left him too tired to perform at his best . Hazard was substituted with 28 minutes In Belgium's 1-0 win over Israel in Jerusalem on Tuesday night . The 24-year-old playmaker has played all but five of Chelsea's games this season, mainly avoiding injury . The 24-year-old playmaker was clearly unhappy to have been substituted and looked to shoot Wilmots a disapproving look as he left the field to be replaced by Nacer Chadli before questioning the manager on his decision after the game. ‘I was a little bit surprised to be substituted,' Hazard said. 'Also, I was a little bit unhappy and I think you could see that I was unhappy. ‘I asked the coach for a reason and he told me that I was tired. Maybe I was a little bit tired. I’ve played a lot of games this season.’ In his post-match comments, Wilmots added: ‘Hazard is not hurt, but I had the impression that he was tired. In these kind of games, you have to react immediately because we did not have time.' Belgium manager Marc Wilmots said he felt that Hazard looked tired, something the player questioned him on . Hazard scored early on in Chelsea's last game, a 3-2 win over Hull City, but the team were pegged back . Hazard is unlikely to get an extended rest any time soon as he returns to Premier League action on Saturday . Belgium captain Vincent Kompany was sent off for a second yellow card within two minutes of Hazard's withdrawal, leaving Belgium clinging on to their slender lead, and Wilmots admitted he may not have substituted his star man had he known his side would be down to 10 men. Despite his admission, Hazard is unlikely to get an extended rest any time soon as he returns to Premier League action with the visit of Stoke City to Stamford Bridge on Saturday. And with a tough run-in and another international break still to come, the Belgian forward could rack up as many as 59 appearances by the time the season finally ends in mid-June. Belgium's win in Jerusalem saw them return to the top of their qualifying group, ahead of Wales on goal difference. They travel to face them in Cardiff in their next competitive game on June 12.

The 35-year-old father-of-three stepped in front of a 12-ton truck on the A64 near York in December, suffering cuts, bruises, internal bleeding, a broken rib and a shattered left knee. The incident has left the ex-Burnley defender with scars all over his body. On television this week Mr Carlisle, who has publicly struggled with depression, revealed the scars he still bears from his suicide attempt are a 'constant reminder' of his good fortune in surviving. Now Mr Carlisle, who played 131 times for the Clarets between 2007 and 2012, said the accident had led to him moving out of the house he shared with wife Gemma. The sportsman, dubbed 'Britain's brainiest footballer' after he appeared on Countdown in 2002, told TalkSport Radio on a special Monday night show: 'At this point, Gemma and I have separated. 'I have moved out of the marital home because I have to focus on my well-being and equally as much Gemma has to do the same. 'She has to deal with her experiences and the effect that has had on her.' Mr Carlisle appeared on Good Morning Britain this week and revealed the scars he still bears from his suicide attempt are a 'constant reminder' of his good fortune in surviving . Asked about how his wife Gemma has taken it, he added: 'Every day has been incredibly tough and different. 'When you have been with someone for 14 years but masking things and thoughts from her, it was because I was a people-pleaser. 'I've desperately wanted to say what I know will make her happy and do the things that I think she wants me to do - instead of being myself.' Earlier this week Mr Carlisle apologised to the driver of the lorry which he jumped in front of in an attempt to kill himself. The former footballer said that he prays for the driver, Darren Pease, every day - but added that he has been unable to apologise in person because the haulier refuses to meet him. Star: Mr Carlisle pictured playing for Burnley against Aston Villa in 2010, at the peak of his footballing career . Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain on Tuesday, Mr Carlisle said he was 'so sorry' for putting Mr Pease through the ordeal of being involved in a near-fatal crash. Speaking earlier this month, Mr Pease, 53, said that he might never be able to drive a lorry again after hitting Mr Carlisle. Mr Carlisle played for nine different clubs in his 16-year career, including five years at Burnley, and served as chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association. Last week, he pleaded guilty to failing to provide a sample when he was stopped by police in December as his car was swerving around the road. He will be sentenced in May.

"Arsenal legend Paul Merson has been forced into an embarrassing climbdown and admitted he was wrong to criticise the England call up for Andros Townsend. The Tottenham winger came off the bench to score the equaliser with a stunning strike in Tuesday's 1-1 draw with Italy in Turin.

Townsend later tweeted to his 285,000 followers: 'Not bad for a player that should be 'nowhere near the squad' ay @PaulMerse?' And Merson insisted on Wednesday he was pleased to be proven wrong by the 23-year-old. Merson told Sky Sports: 'It's just a matter of opinion, and my opinion was that he got pulled off after half an hour at Manchester United in front of Roy Hodgson, so he shouldn't have been in the squad. 'But fair play to him, I only give my opinion, and sometimes I'm wrong, other times I'm right. 'When I'm wrong, I hold my hands up. I don't have a problem with doing that - I'll always be the first to admit when I'm wrong. 'It's not as though I was watching hoping he wouldn't score for England, I'm genuinely pleased for him and fair play to him – it was a great goal.

"It seems an accepted trend that Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas struggles during the second half of the season and the Spanish midfielder was one of the worst players on the pitch again in his country's 2-0 defeat by Holland on Tuesday. The 27-year-old spoke of his happiness in south west London earlier this week but his form has significantly dipped from that of the player who, around Christmas, looked a dead-cert to break the Barclays Premier League record for assists. On Tuesday - his first international appearance since October - he was given just four out of 10 by one Spanish newspaper and while his season is likely to end in success with the Premier League title following a Capital One Cup win, questions remain about Fabregas' durability. Cesc Fabregas (right) captained Spain on Tuesday but his poor form continued as they lost 2-0 in Holland . The Chelsea midfielder struggled to make an impact in midfield as the European champions fell to defeat . After a brilliant start to the season at Stamford Bridge, the Spaniard's form has dropped off somewhat of late . 'I'm playing almost every minute of every match (with Chelsea) and that's what makes me happy,' he said this week. But a long, intense campaign on his return to England is taking its toll on the Spaniard. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho will have been concerned to see his player toiling in midfield for the full 90 minutes at the Amsterdam ArenA, adding to the fatigue that seems to have seen his role as a key man in the Blues' title charge decline of late. Fabregas captained the European champions in the Dutch capital but struggled to make any real impact against Manchester United's Daley Blind or goalscorer Davy Klaassen. Jose Mourinho will be demanding more from his deep-lying playmaker in the Premier League run-in . Diego Costa and Fabregas enjoyed a great start together and linked up again in Chelsea's 3-2 win at Hull City . Fabregas was brilliant for Chelsea in their big win away at Swansea City in January but has struggled since . After his £30million transfer to Chelsea last summer, Fabregas' former club Barcelona released a statement that pointed at his traditional post-Christmas slump. 'There has been a downward trend in his stats every season at the club,' it read. 'Despite glowing starts to each campaign, Cesc's contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close. 'From being someone who joined in with the attack, supplying and scoring goals, the magic tended to fade later on in each season.' And it seems to have rung true on the stats front. Having picked up 15 Premier League assists by mid-January, he has just one in five games he has played since, and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015. Thierry Henry's record of 20 had looked almost certain to fall but given his current form, Fabregas is now on track to fall just short. However, with nine games to play Chelsea are still to face six opponents who their key man in midfield has laid on goals against. Fabregas' former team-mate Thierry Henry (right) holds the record for assists in a Premier League season . Henry managed 20 assists in the 2002-03 season and Fabregas looked set to beat that haul before his slump . When he left Barcelona, the  club commented on Fabregas' unwanted reputation for a late-season slump . Their opponents on Saturday, Stoke City, as well as Queens Park Rangers, Manchester United, Arsenal, Leicester City and West Bromwich Albion have all been opened up by Fabregas' passing ability this season, while he scored in Chelsea's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in October. The personal accolade will be important to the midfielder, but more key is the boost it could give to his club. Chelsea could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games, and if Fabregas finds form again the Premier League title could be wrapped up within weeks. Mourinho will hope his assist for Diego Costa in Chelsea's last game against Hull City is a sign of a late-season resurgence to prove any doubters wrong. Fabregas laid on an assist for Costa in Chelsea's 3-2 win over Hull City, but that was his first in five games . Mourinho is looking to guide his team over the line in the Premier League title race, with Fabregas a key cog .","Cesc Fabregas' poor form continued for Spain against Holland on Tuesday .

"Get ready to dig deep - the impulse to buy a treat peaks today at 12.52pm. A study claims that Britons spend an average of £62 a week on rewarding themselves, with retail therapy reaching a high at lunchtime today. Treats can range from as little as a bar of chocolate or a glass of wine to designer clothes and shoes, according to research by website VoucherCodes.co.uk. A study reveals that Britons spend an average of £62 a week on rewarding themselves, with retail therapy reaching a high at lunchtime today. Treats can range from a bar of chocolate to a glass of wine . And surprisingly, men spend a third more a month than women on treating themselves. They are also more likely to lie about their expenditure and hide items they have purchased from their partners in a desperate quest to keep their shopping habits under wraps, a different survey last year found. The shoppers of Swansea are the most frivolous, with 44 per cent splurging as soon as they are paid, followed by those in Aberdeen (42 per cent) and Belfast (39 per cent). The most cautious spenders live in Wolverhampton, where only 19 per cent choose to treat themselves on pay day. Designer items (stock image above) are also popular buys and men spend a third more a month than women on treating themselves, the research claims . Other research claimed the average Brit spends £153 within 24 hours of payday - while 10 per cent splurge more than £500. Some workers said they spend so much in the 24 hours after payday because they had arranged their regular payments and direct debits to leave their accounts around that time. While others said it was because they felt like they deserved the treat.","Britons spend an average of £62 a week on treats, a new study claims .

"Arsene Wenger is so respected and so clearly a deeply intelligent man that every now and then you find yourself nodding sagely at something he has said which, upon closer examination, turns out to sound right but to have decidedly unsubstantial foundations. Usually it is related to how Arsenal’s defensive record is statistically actually very good (it is) in the aftermath of the latest debacle. But last week it was on the issue of quotas, or more specifically FA chairman Greg Dyke’s idea of increasing the number of homegrown players in a Premier League squad of 25 from eight to 12. ‘I believe that we are in the world of competition,’ said Wenger in one of his regular interviews to beIN Sports. ‘That means as well that the rules of the game must be structured to favour the best or we are not in a competition anymore. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger shows his frustrations during a Premier League match in March 2011 . FA chairman Greg Dyke pictured attending the friendly between England and Italy in Turin on Tuesday . ‘So we can say one or two things – we protect the mediocre or we produce the best players. If you want to sell the Premier League for a huge amount of money then we need to say: ""Buy this, this is the best league in the world."" You cannot go against the quality and what is at the heart of our job, which is competition.’ And on the surface there seems nothing wrong with this. As an economics graduate Wenger is a disciple of Adam Smith and these are the basic principles of a free market. Tear down barriers, let competition flourish and the best man or woman will ultimately win – or at least have a place in Wenger’s starting XI. It sounds sensible enough but of course the issue is a little more complex than Wenger implies. A cursory glance at Wenger’s transfer record shows in his bid to save the Premier League from English mediocrity he has signed Tomas Danilevicius, Igor Stepanovs, Kaba Diawara, Sebastian Squillaci, Andre Santos, Amoury Bischoff, Park Chu-Young, Marouane Chamakh, Pascal Cygan, Philippe Senderos, Denilson, Manuel Almunia and Johan Djourou. Arsenal's Andre Santos on the ball during a league match against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in 2011 . Marouane Chamakh (left) attempts to control the ball during a Capital One Cup clash with Reading in 2012 . Arsenal midfielder Denilson (left) holds off Leyton Orient's Stephen Dawson at the Emirates in 2011 . There are more but that’s what a brief search elicits. You might argue that you need to sign ten Park Chu-youngs to get one Robin van Persie. And of course, over 18 years any manager, even a great one as Wenger is, can make some dud buys. He made some very good ones from abroad as well: Thierry Henry, Robert Pires, Cesc Fabegas... we could go on. But the list of shame does expose a flaw at the heart of his argument. Clubs always argue for fewer restrictions and they always say it is to do with excellence. The reality is it’s just as much to do with cost. There is nothing in Greg Dyke’s proposals to stop Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla playing for Arsenal. It might however make it a little trickier for the likes of Almunia, Andre Santos and Stepanovs in the future. The reason why Arsenal went for Stepanovs back in 2000 was not because it he was excellent; it was because he was cheaper than the equivalent English player; same with Almunia in 2004 and Andre Santos in 2011. Turns out they weren’t good enough either. Arsenal's Park Chu-young in action during a Carling Cup match against Shrewsbury Town in 2011 . Igor Stepanovs (left) battles with Sunderland's Kevin Phillips for the ball at Highbury in December 2000 . Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia watches a shot go wide at the Emirates Stadium in January 2011 . Now it may be that applying more quotas could be detrimental to Dyke’s vision of encouraging clubs to play English players in that it pushes their price up even more. That’s a debate worth having but the main thrust of Dyke’s proposals is simply to encourage the clubs to rely less on the marketplace and grow their own players. For Wenger’s argument sounds great in theory but the reality is that there is a class of players at the tip of the footballers’ pyramid which stand out and which any team would want – the Thierry Henrys, Patrick Vierias of this world. Nothing in Dyke’s rules to prevent them from signing, as they were EU nationals. You would only have to be a little more sure you could find space for them as one of your 13 – that’s 13! – foreign players in your squad of 25. But there is another tier of players below that – let’s says the Mathieu Flamini and Mikel Arteta level (who would also still be available under they Dyke proposals as EU players). These are good players, but they are much more plentiful than the elite. In fact, given the right training and a chance in the first team, you could probably produce your own. Arsenal did once: Ray Parlour. Served Wenger quite well, too, in his double-winning and Invincible years. Ray Parlour falls to the ground after a tackle by Tottenham's Jamie Redknapp at White Hart Lane in 2004 . Wenger (left) watches on from the touchline as Arsenal face Monaco in the Champions League last month . But Parlour was developed before Wenger arrived and he was the beneficiary of a youth system which was thriving at the time. The Arsenal manager, since his arrival, has never shown an awful amount of interest in Arsenal’s youth set-up. He is undoubtedly a manager who supports young players – it’s just most of them are signed from abroad or Southampton rather than coming from his own academy. The fact that Kieran Gibbs and Jack Wilshere are regular starters and were players developed at Arsenal's academy during Wenger’s 18 years is exceptional for his period as manager. Ashley Cole was his greatest find from that source but who knows what would have happened to him had Silvinho not had to leave the club suddenly when his Portuguese nationality was called into question? All Dyke is trying to do is focus clubs and their managers on trying a little bit harder to look in their own backyard before spending £2million on Pascal Cygan. Nothing he has proposed would stop Premier League clubs from signing genuine superstars. The ‘best league in the world’ (the league, incidentally, without any qualifiers in the Champions League quarter-finals under the current policy) is under no threat whatsoever. Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs (left) breaks past QPR's Darnell Furlong at Loftus Road last month . Arsenal's Jack Wilshere (front) charges forward with the ball during a friendly against Brentford on Tuesday . Sadly Dyke probably killed his idea by announcing it in public before asking the clubs. If there is one thing guaranteed to rile the Premier League, it’s attempting to dictate terms. The only way to cajole the multi-national group of owners and executives into helping English football is by convincing them it’s in their own interests. Most are already on board in theory with the narrative that homegrown players are worthwhile. But now they need an additional nudge to take the final step and actually play some of their expensively-trained academy players. Even Mauricio Pochettino, who has a great track record with English players, wouldn’t have given Harry Kane a go if Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor had been producing. But if Kane isn’t a good enough incentive for the Premier League clubs to work harder to promote players, perhaps their recent travails in the Champions League and Europa League might convince them. A majority of the best players in the world are being produced in Spain and South America; another significant proportion come from Germany. Tottenham's Emmanuel Adebayor gestures during the Capital One Cup semi-final in January . Tottenham star Harry Kane celebrates after scoring against Leicester at White Hart Lane last month . The best of those players will naturally aspire to play for Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Now that Financial Fair Play restrictions mean the wages are no bigger over here, those that come to the Premier League will be the second tier of stars that can’t make it at those clubs. If English clubs want to be the best in the world, they’re going to have to become an awful lot better at creating the best players. And if Wenger wants to examine something truly mediocre he might wish to cast his eye over the Premier League’s record in Europe over the past three seasons. In fact, if he paid a little more attention to building a core of homegrown players then perhaps, like Ajax, AC Milan, Manchester United, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, Arsenal might have won the Champions League by now.","FA chairman Greg Dyke wants to increase the minimum homegrown players in a Premier League squad of 25 from eight to 12 .

"Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri goes into this weekend's Serie A games admitting he does not expect to be fully embraced by the team's fans until he steers the club to a title. Having joined the Turin outfit last summer, several months after being sacked by AC Milan, Allegri has hardly put a foot wrong, coaching Juve to a commanding lead in the race for the Scudetto.

'When I arrived, I feared that I would not be able to win the hearts of the fans because I had promised to achieve that with results,' Allegri told his club's official website. 'I have forgiven the initial scepticism because it was right to do that. What happened last July to Juventus was a shock (Conte's resignation). 'We have worked and are having a good season that we need to conclude positively, seeing as we have not won anything yet.' Juve are 14 points clear of Roma at the top of the standings with 10 games remaining. If they win the league, it will be a fourth straight Scudetto for the club. Carlos Tevez (centre) scored twice as Juventus cruised past Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League . Allegri has also guided the Bianconeri into the Champions League quarter-finals and the Coppa Italia semi-finals. Roma, who are just one point clear of Lazio, host fellow Champions League hopefuls Napoli on Saturday. Lazio carry a six-match winning run in Serie A with them to Sardinia to face Cagliari. The Biancoceleste hold the last Champions League qualifying spot and are four points clear of nearest rivals Sampdoria. Samp make the trip to Florence to take on Fiorentina also in fine fettle after winning their last four league games. France's Paul Pogba has been an integral part of the Juventus side 14 points clear at the top of  Serie A . Fiorentina are two places and two points behind Saturday's opponents and are unbeaten at home in Serie A since November 9.

"When you’re in good touch, it just takes a moment. Nathan Redmond had only been on the pitch for six minutes when he made the decisive intervention in this tightly-fought encounter, but what a crucial one it could prove to be. Steven Whittaker, with sharp eyes and precise feet, played Redmond in down the right touchline, the ball hugging the white line as it went forward.

Norwich were inferior for pretty much the rest of the contest but needed only this flash of inspiration to keep their Barclays Premier League promotion hopes on course. It just takes a moment. It took Alex Neil’s record as manager to 11 wins from 16 - a magnificent return - and has them breathing down the necks of Middlesbrough and Bournemouth, who occupy those coveted automatic spots. Down and out of the race at the New Year, they are now fancied by many. The manner of the defeat would have frustrated Chris Hughton, desperate to get one over on his former employers. But in the end, even he would appreciate the ruthless smash and grab nature of Norwich’s win here. Hughton insisted in advance of the game that he bore no animosity to his former employers, who dumped him in April 2014 as the club sat 17th and safe in the Premier League. They weren’t able to maintain that position and were relegated but under the masterful guidance of Neil have mounted an impressive late charge for an immediate return to the big time. The Canaries travelled down to the south coast having lost just once in their last dozen games and eight wins within that sequence had them anchored in the play-offs, with reasonable hope of more. And in persistent drizzle at The Amex, they made the brighter opening. Jonny Howson touched a free-kick short to Johnson who, off a fast bowler’s run-up, leathered a rocket shot that David Stockdale had to turn around the post. If Norwich do gain promotion, Cameron Jerome will have been one of the main reasons with his 19 goals and his awareness teed up Wes Hoolahan, whose shot was blocked by Stockdale at his near post. Jerome gesticulates during the Championship encounter at the Amex Stadium on Good Friday . Norwich midfielder Jonathan Howson shows his anger at a decision by shouting at the linesman . And Jerome was a stud’s length away from turning home Martin Olsson’s wicked left-wing cross just before the half-hour mark.

Rohan Ince and Beram Kayal gained a stranglehold on the midfield, while Liverpool loanee Joao Teixeira was often too hot for the Norwich defence to handle. He was wayward, however, when Kayal seized upon a weak pass from Sebastien Bassong, roamed unchallenged into the area and set him up in a good shooting-position. Teixeira dragged his effort wide of the post, to Bassong’s great relief. But the skilful Portuguese was soon back in the action, waltzing into the area and firing off a firm low shot that Ruddy palmed back out. Chris O’Grady was lurking but Norwich captain Russell Martin cleared. Johnson shoots at Brighton goalkeeper David Stockdale's during his side's 1-0 win against Brighton . In stoppage time, it was the turn of Graham Dorrans to be hesitant at the back, clearing in too much of a hurry and inviting Teixeira to run it back. Ruddy blocked with his legs at the near post. In the away technical area, Neil cut an irritated figure. He stomped around restlessly, throwing up his arms and cursing every time a move broke down. His half-time team talk was no doubt voluble. It took a while to sink in but the result was spectacular when it did as Johnson made the difference. ‘Going up, up, up’ chanted the 3,000-plus from Norfolk and for the only time all afternoon, Neil permitted himself a smile. Hughton rolled the dice, introducing Kazenga LuaLua first then Leon Best and Craig Mackail-Smith. Slowly, they started to create more and Ruddy bravely intervened to reach LuaLua’s drilled cross in front of Mackail-Smith. But the late siege didn’t come and Norwich go rolling on.

"For residents of Celoron, N.Y., the statue of hometown icon Lucile Ball is no laughing matter and hasn't been for the past six years. In 2009 the town unveiled a statue of Ball with a face so unlike the beloved comedian that locals have reacted with shock and horror. The depiction is so unflattering a Facebook page called 'We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue' has attracted more than 600 likes. Scroll down for video . For residents of Celoron, N.Y., say a statue of hometown icon Lucile Ball is 'monstrous' The statue is based on a famous moment from Ball's show 'I Love Lucy,' in which she pitches an intoxicating health tonic while drunk . Yahoo reports that the anonymous man behind the page says he's a 'big fan of Lucy's.' 'Lucille Ball was not only an amazing comedienne, but she was a stunning beauty. Her sense of humor only made her more beautiful,” he told the site. 'This statue looks nothing like the beautiful Lucy we all know. If for no other reason than that... the statue should go.' He added: 'I don’t think this can be repaired. Take a look at the beautiful statues Nick at Nite created for ‘Bewitched’ and ‘The Honeymooners’ and Bob Newhart… it needs to be something more like those.' Artist Dave Poulin has declined comment. It would cost an estimated $8,000 to $10,000 for Poulin to recast the statue, according to the Celoron Mayor Scott Schrecengost. While the organizer said he is a fan of Poulin's work, this time he failed to do his subject justice. Artist Dave Poulin has declined to comment on the controversy surrounding his work . 'I think it looks like a monster. That is just my opinion,' he told Yahoo. 'When you see it at night, it is frightening.' The statue depicts Ball during one of her most loved moments on the pioneering show 'I Love Lucy,' her intoxicated pitch for the Vitameatavegamin health tonic. The statue was the latest way the town has tried to honor its most famous resident, with the Jameston area already home to a Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum & Center for Comedy.","The depiction is so unflattering a Facebook page called 'We Love Lucy!

The spine-tinging video, which was captured in Wangaratta, northeast Victoria, begins with the man approaching his black Holden Ute and spraying the door with an insect repellent. The driver  sprays his car with insect repellent, forcing a huntsman spider to reveal itself from under the door handle . ‘Get out, you bast***,’ he stoically says to the spider. But the man appears less composed when the hairy huntsman’s legs pop out, yelping and cowering back in fright. ‘That’s the creepiest thing ever,’ he says between yelling expletives. ‘It’s a bloody super-spider!’ Having endured  enough of the spray, the spider drops onto road and retreats underneath the vehicle. 'Yeah, I love living in the bush,' declares the man. The spider drops onto road and retreats underneath the vehicle, much to the drivers relief .

"Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has likened England hot-shot Harry Kane to Gabriel Batistuta and insisted he will be there to help him when things do not go to plan. Kane moved to within two strikes of the 30-goal barrier for the season after scoring on his full international debut some 79 seconds after coming on against Lithuania at Wembley last Friday night. England boss Roy Hodgson is mindful of keeping expectations in check for Kane, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise after finally breaking into the Spurs first-team following loan spells at the likes of Leicester and Norwich. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has compared Harry Kane to Gabriel Batistuta . Batistuta was an Argentina international who also played for Italian club Roma . Pochettino has said he will be there to help Kane when things are not going to plan for him . Pochettino (right) played alongside Batistuta with the Argentina international team . Former Argentina international Pochettino knows lows can come just as quickly as highs, so will be ready to offer Kane advice whenever it is needed. 'Harry Kane has skills that are similar to different players, including Batistuta. The challenge is doing it all again next season,' said Pochettino, who faced England in the 2002 World Cup finals in the same team as the renowned Argentina forward. 'Now it is up to him. Harry knows the way to improve his ability. He is in a very good moment to keep working hard and develop his game. 'You need to wait for the right moment to give a player the responsibility because sometimes we can see a player is ready, but not quite complete to assume the responsibility and keep the same level. 'Big players always have a good first season - like (Wayne) Rooney, after his first season a lot of people maybe had doubts about the next one, but this is football. 'It is not easy when the player goes down, this is our challenge, but not only with Harry, with all players. 'There may be people who doubt him about next season, but the people that know him understand, like us, know that Harry can keep the level he has shown.' England boss Hodgson wants Kane to continue his international development with the Under 21s this summer, after helping Gareth Southgate's team qualify unbeaten for the June tournament in Portugal. Spurs, meanwhile, are set for an end-of-season trip to Sydney for a match at the ANZ Stadium on May 30, with Kane expected to feature. Kane marked his England debut with a goal against Lithuania, 79 seconds after replacing Wayne Rooney .

Pochettino, though, believes with the right discussions a positive solution for all parties can be found to avoid any potential of player burnout. The Tottenham manager said: 'It is only one week in Sydney. We need to analyse after the holidays, the amount of rest he will need (before the start of the 2015-16 campaign). 'Different players need different amounts of rest, so we will have a lot of different dates for players to start their pre-season.'","Harry Kane is approaching 30 goals for the season in all competitions .

"A former footballer who fronted a £30million investment scheme and lived a millionaire's lifestyle is now 'surviving on handouts', a court has heard. Michael McIndoe, who played for Bristol City and Wolverhampton Wanderers, lured fellow footballers into the scheme with promises of a huge 20 per cent return. But the scheme collapsed amid mounting debts and the tricky winger was declared bankrupt in October last year with more than £2million debts. The footballer - who was known as 'Mr Big' in Marbella, where he partied with glamorous girls, is now being chased through the courts by creditors. McIndoe, circled smoking on a cigar, lived a millionaire's lifestyle but is now surviving on handouts . The former winger revelled in the glamorous lifestyle after persuading fellow players to sign up to the scheme . McIndoe celebrates scoring against Arsenal in December 2005 - it has now been revealed he has no income . Scots-born McIndoe dated a string of glamour models, including Helena Fletcher and Emma Frain (pictured) The 35-year-old told a hearing in London he was now surviving on the generosity of 'good friends and family'. He said: 'Since the bankruptcy, my girlfriend gave me some cash in July and I believe the trustee's solicitors are pressing for that money to be paid back. 'I have received some money from friends, around £9,000, and some money from NatWest for overcharging me on an account. 'But I have no income.' He added how he was not claiming Jobseekers' Allowance and said his legal representatives were working without fee. Questioned by barrister Mr Andrew Carruth, on behalf of the trustees of his bankrupt estate, he said he had not bet for two years and that reports of his previous gambling accounts topping £1 million were 'vastly over rated'. He said £1.5 million owed to one creditor had been invested into 'Stamp', the private members London nightclub he launched in 2011, but was later closed. McIndoe also denied selling a property in Edinburgh at a cheap rate as part of a panic selling reaction to his financial meltdown. McIndoe and his friends at the Ocean Club in Marbella where 'beds' can cost up to 7,950 euros (£5,790) A footballer taken in by the scheme alleges McIndoe had spent £40,000 on champagne in one day . The former winger played for Bristol City in the Championship final in 2008 - the 'Cider Army' lost to Hull City . It was revealed in January this year that up to 300 players signed up to the scheme that may be the biggest swindle ever to hit the British game. The scheme sucked in players including former Tottenham Hotspur forward Robbie Keane and ex-Fulham midfielder Jimmy Bullard, who is thought to have lost around £600,000 which led him to go on the ITV reality show, I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. McIndoe was made bankrupt in October last year with disclosed debts of £2.4m. Furious creditors are demanding answers to where there money has gone but McIndoe - who now lives with his mother in Edinburgh - said he had no property and his only bank account had been frozen. McIndoe used the promise of 20 per cent returns on people's money to fund his champagne lifestyle . McIndoe started out at Luton Town, making his debut in 1998 and playing for the Hatters 39 times before joining Hereford on a free in 2000. Yeovil then snapped him up for £25,000 the following year. He scored 22 goals in 91 outings for the Glovers, winning promotion from the Conference in 2003 before joining Doncaster for £50,000. McIndoe twice made the PFA Team of the Year with Rovers and was his side's joint-top scorer in 2004-05 with 12 goals. He twice represented the Scotland B side during his time at Rovers. After a loan spell at Derby he joined Barnsley then Wolves, on loan again, before the deal was made permanent for £250,000. He signed a three-year contract with Bristol City in 2007 and scored the winner against Crystal Palace in the second leg of the 2008 Championship play-off semi-final. They lost out to Hull at Wembley and McIndoe had one more season at Ashton Gate before joining Coventry. He also had a brief loan stint at MK Dons. At the height of his scheme, McIndoe revelled in a playboy's lifestyle, partying in Marbella with a limitless credit card and wads of cash. He hired huge villas in Marbella, where he drove a fleet of expensive cars such as a Bentley and a Maybach and hired celebrities, such as the X Factor winner Alexandra Burke to perform at lavish parties. Scots-born McIndoe also dated a string of glamour models, including Helena Fletcher and Emma Frain. 'He was the Mr Big in Marbella, buying loads of champagne and girls all over the place. He even had a bodyguard,' said one footballer, who lost around £75,000 in the scheme. He ran lavish parties at clubs including Funky Buddha in London and ploughed money into private members' club Stamp on Oxford Street. The 35-year-old is also claimed to have rented a £4,000-a-week suite in London's five-star Mayfair Hotel. He also had in an apartment in Eaton Square, one of the UK's poshest addresses in the exclusive Belgravia district of the capital. But last year, the funds dried up and he was investigated. McIndoe told the court he had co-operated with the official receiver and had handed over documents ahead of a meeting with trustees next week. The bankruptcy hearing was adjourned till June 17.","Michael McIndoe lured players into scheme with promise of 20% return .

"Juventus director Pavel Nedved has revealed that Barcelona are interested in bringing Paul Pogba to the Nou Camp. In an interview with Mundo Deportivo, the former midfielder, who made 324 appearances for the Turin club, insisted the French star won't be moving anywhere. But he also admitted he was pleased Juve didn't draw the Catalan side in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Pavel Nedved, pictured during his days as a Juventus player, has revealed Barcelona's interest in Paul Pogba . The Czech star, who is a director at Juventus, insisted that French midfielder Pogba will not be moving . Nedved said: We are aware that Barca and other big clubs want him but he has a contract with us.' Barca cannot acquire any players until 2016 after the Catalan club was punished for breaching rules regarding the signing of international players under the age of 18. Pogba has been strongly linked with a move to Paris St Germain this summer while former club United as well as neighbours Manchester City and Premier League leaders Chelsea are also reported to be interested in signing the midfielder. The Frenchman played a major role in helping Juventus clinch their third successive scudetto last season, scoring seven goals and setting up seven more in 36 Serie A appearances for the Bianconeri. Juve, who are still competing on three fronts this season, are currently without Pogba's services after he sustained a hamstring injury last month and was ruled out of action until May. 'We lose a lot without him,' Nedved said. 'He is a footballer with an enormous quality but we cannot cry about it. 'We have a great roster that can overcome his loss.' Nedved expressed his relief that Juventus avoided Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals . Nedved believes that Lionel Messi is currently in the greatest form of his career . Asked for his opinion on Barcelona, Nedved said: 'Barca are now so unpredictable and this makes them even more dangerous. 'With players like Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, if they can run, they will. They were amazing against Manchester City and gave an exhibition. 'Messi is a fantastic player and I don't know what to think when I see him on the pitch. 'He's been at a high level for many years but maybe now he's having his best spell. It's great to see him enjoying playing football. 'I didn't want Barca in the quarter-finals. They are among the two best teams in Europe and favourites to win the Champions League alongside Bayern Munich. 'They are playing to a really high standard, as can be seen by their results over the past few months. Juventus are heading for another Scudetto, enjoying a 14-point lead over nearest challengers Roma . Nedved fires home against Real Madrid in the 2003 Champions League semi-final . Nedved in action for the Czech Republic during the 2006 World Cup group match with Ghana . Nedved, who made 91 appearances and scored 18 goals for the Czech Republic, added that Real Madrid are 'not at the level of last year,' when they beat Atletico Madrid to win the Champions League. Juventus, who have a massive 14-point lead over Roma in Italy, have drawn French team Monaco in the last eight. Although they are arguably the weakest team left in the competition, Nedved has warned against complacency. 'Obviously there were more famous opponents we could have drawn,' he said. 'But we must not underestimate Monaco. 'They went dangerously close to being knocked out at home, but they impressed me against Arsenal in London.'","Barcelona among host of clubs keen on signing Paul Pogba .

'Dad took me out into the course and made me hit a couple of shots and that's how I got into golf,' says a young McIlroy at the beginning of the feature. The moments of triumph are not the only events covered in the video as McIlroy's implosion at the WGC Cadillac Championship when he threw his 3-iron in the lake out of sheer frustration is also touched upon. 'There's always going to be highs and lows,' says the Northern Irishman. 'There's been low points in my professional career. I think everybody goes through that at some part of their life where they're not quite comfortable with who they are and they're trying to figure themselves out.

The Northern Irishman heads to Augusta hoping to complete a full set of major titles . 'I guess you just have to go back to the drawing board.

McIlroy's grueling training regime has been well documented with the video showcasing the Holywood native hard at work in the gym as he steps up his preparations for the big one in Augusta on April 9. 'I had this vision and this dream of trying to become the best player in the world and I just wanted to do everything I could to try and achieve that. McIlroy hits the road as the World No 1 steps up his training ahead of the 2015 Masters on April 9 . 'I've never been a perfectionist, but I've always wanted to be the best that I can be.' 'People didn't think that I worked as hard as I did. They think that it's mostly natural talent. They don't see the hard work that goes in behind it to be able to achieve these things.' He continues: 'I try to not talk about the Masters. People have been bringing it up since last year. It sort of means more this year because it's the only one that I haven't won. 'But, it's just another golf tournament. It can only distract from what you're trying to do which is to just go out and play as best as you can.' 'I think once you achieve something, you need to reset your goals. That's what gives you the motivation to keep coming back and keep practicing and keep trying to get better.'","Rory McIlroy heads to the Masters hoping to complete a career grand slam .

"Sergio Garcia insists he is focused on winning his first PGA Tour title since 2012 at this week's Shell Houston Open, despite the Masters being just around the corner. Rory McIlroy's bid for a third major victory in succession to complete the career grand slam, plus the question of whether Tiger Woods will end his self-imposed exile from the game, have dominated the agenda for weeks. But, although the Golf Club of Houston is set up to try to replicate some of the conditions the players will face at Augusta, Garcia is concentrating on ending his victory drought. Sergio Garcia lines up a putt during the Cadillac Championship in Doral, Florida last month . The 35-year-old, who finished third 12 months ago but went on to miss the cut at Augusta, told a pre-tournament press conference: 'I think that every single week it's a new story and some weeks you play terrible and then the next week you play amazing. 'Some weeks you play great and the next week you play terrible and some weeks I play great and then you play great. You never know what's going to come out. Obviously you hope and you wish that you play as best as you can. 'I think that there's no doubt that obviously the Masters is in the back of our minds, but I'm here to play well, to get in some good rhythm, to have a chance at winning this week and then as soon as Sunday finishes then I'll concentrate on the Masters. Garcia hits his approach from the fairway at the TPC Blue Monster Course last month . 'I'm not going to be on the golf course this week thinking maybe let's try this shot because I'll have it next week on the 12th or on the 15th or something like that. No. I'm going to be focused on what I want to achieve here and then when Sunday finishes then I can concentrate on next week. 'I felt really comfortable here when I came last year. I wanted to try it again this year and hopefully I'll do better next week, too.' Spaniard Garcia plays out of the trees by the 11th hole at Augusta during the Masters in 2013 . Garcia is also comfortable with the fact that he may never win a major after coming close yet again in the Open last year, finishing second behind McIlroy at Hoylake. 'If it comes down to me not winning any majors when I'm done with my golfing career, I'm not going to be sad,' he added. 'It's not the main thing. Obviously it's something nice to have, and if I get it I'm not going to give it back, but it's not the main thing in my life. 'I think as you get older, as you get more and more experience, you realize the important things in life. I'm not saying that winning a major is not important, but it's not the most important thing in the world. I think there's a lot of other things that you can do that can not only fulfil you as a player, but also as a person.' Garcia (left) stands beside Rickie Fowler with their runner-up trophies at last year's Open at Hoylake . Garcia and Texas native Jordan Spieth are the only players in the world's top 10 left in the field after the withdrawals of Henrik Stenson and Jimmy Walker. World number two Stenson has the flu and cancelled a trip to Augusta, while Walker headed to Augusta after winning the Valero Texas Open but was taken ill and joined Stenson in pulling out. The winner in Houston will qualify for the Masters if they are not already exempt.","Sergio Garcia is looking to win his first PGA Tour title since 2012 .

"Jailed: Riki Hughes stole £17,000 from the football club where he volunteered as club secretary . A veteran of the Iraq war stole thousands of pounds from a children's football club and spent the money on a stag trip to Las Vegas. Lance Corporal Riki Hughes has been jailed for 16 months after he plundered the accounts of Tidworth Town Football Club, where he volunteered as club secretary. He claimed to be making rent payments to the club's landlord - even though the team was actually getting its property for free. Hughes, 31, spent the money on himself, including camping equipment and a stag holiday to Las Vegas, Salisbury Crown Court heard. The former soldier, who served two tours in Iraq, pleaded guilty to stealing £17,000, but the club claimed that the total theft amounted to £26,000. He made out 70 bogus rent payments to an account he'd set up in the name of landlord Aspire Defence, which was not charging the club rent. Judge Andrew Barnett said: 'For two years you milked the funds of that football club, set up principally for those involved in the services and their children. 'You in effect treated a great deal of club money as your own. It was spent on personal luxuries. That's a disgraceful thing to do.' Hughes, from Andover in Hampshire, has been working as a telecoms engineer since he left the Army. Holiday: Hughes spent the money on a stag holiday in Las Vegas, pictured, and camping equipment . The court heard that he had an exemplary career in the military, and no prior criminal record. Relatives burst into tears when Hughes was sentenced to 16 months in prison. Speaking after the case, Tidworth Town chairman said the Wiltshire club was happy that justice had been done. 'It's a relief we can put this to bed now,' he said.","Ex-soldier Riki Hughes, 31, was the club secretary at Tidworth Town FC .

"Success is a gloriously familiar routine for Johnny Sexton. Adding gold-plated entries to his personal CV has become an annual exercise – a tradition he is hell-bent on maintaining. As he prepared for a European Champions Cup quarter-final showdown with Saracens on Sunday in Paris, Racing Metro’s No 10 and Irish icon reflected on his healthy habit. ‘I’ve been very lucky to have been part of some great sides with Leinster and Ireland, and there haven’t been too many years that have gone by that I haven’t been part of a side winning trophies,’ he said. In fact, since the 29-year-old established himself at senior level, 2010 stands alone as a year without substantial reward. There were league titles in 2008 and 2013, Heineken Cups in 2009, 2011 and 2012, a Challenge Cup in 2013, plus the Test peaks – Six Nations titles this year and last, and a Lions series triumph in Australia in 2013. Johnny Sexton wants to full the void by winning a medal with Racing Metro this season . Short of helping Ireland to win the World Cup later this year, there’s not much left for Sexton to achieve, but he won’t settle for what he has. None of the medals have been earned in the colours of Racing, and filling that void in his check-list is a pressing priority. With a summer return to Dublin approaching, Sexton said: ‘I was speaking to Ronan (O’Gara – former Ireland team-mate and Racing’s kicking coach) last week and saying, for me, for my two years here to be a success, we need to pick up a trophy. Whenever I come back to France, I want to be able to hold my head up high, say that I gave my best to Racing while I was here and helped the club achieve something.’ The Parisian team are in the knock-out stages of Europe’s elite event for the first time, but it is familiar territory for their Irish playmaker. Sexton has featured in 11 knock-out games in continental rugby and won the lot. It is a proud record that hadn’t really occurred to him. Sexton has helped French side reach the knock-out stages of Europe’s elite event for first time . ‘I hadn’t realised that. That builds the pressure on me nicely,’ he quipped. ‘I’ ve never played a knock-out game for Racing, so hopefully it’s going to be one from one!’ Pressure is no problem to him. He handled the scrutiny of being the conductor for the Lions and has rarely faltered in conveying a sense of supreme self-belief. When Leinster were staring down the barrel in the 2011 Heineken Cup Final in Cardiff – trailing 22-6 to Northampton at half-time – Sexton scored two second-half tries in a 28-point haul to propel his province to a comeback victory which took an instant place in the folklore of club rugby in the northern hemisphere. These days, he is often acclaimed as the world’s premier fly-half. Asked about the accolade, he said: ‘I’ve worked hard throughout my career to try to get people to think that way of me, so when you hear that it is very nice and you feel that all your work has paid off. But you’re the best one day and the worst the next, so I try to stay grounded. I’ve gone through a lot of ups and downs in my career, so I will keep my feet firmly on the ground.’ Sexton intends to return to Dublin in the summer after two years in France . In truth, there have been more of the ups than the downs. Sexton had to bide his time to become a fixture in the Ireland team – serving an impatient apprenticeship behind O’Gara. The pair were known to have a frosty relationship for a while, based on the fierce contest for the No 10 shirt, so there was surprise when O’Gara followed his younger compatriot to Racing as a kicking coach. However, the ice has long since thawed. There is warmth between them now. ‘It was many years ago that we were probably best of enemies,’ said Sexton. ‘I was the young up-start who was trying to get into the Irish team, and he was the established international. But towards the latter part of his career we became good buddies, as players. It’s been great working with him here. Ronan has been someone for me to bounce stuff off, when things are going well or going badly.’ Initially, both Irishmen struggled to settle in Paris. A lack of fluent French was a significant issue for Sexton, as the man charged with orchestrating his Gallic club’s attacking game. ‘It was very tough at the start,’ he said. ‘When I came over, I didn’t have a great grasp of the language and I play in a position where it really helps to have a good grasp of French. ‘For the first four or five months, it was tough. I came off the back of the Lions tour, I had about two weeks off then started my season straight away, without much of a break. So the start was difficult, but then we started to improve as a team and turned things around. Now it has come full circle. I am much more settled and I can speak the language pretty well. I’m going to miss a lot of people here.’ Last summer, Sexton agonised over his next career move and eventually resolved to re-join Leinster, rather than sign another contract with Racing – who have made light of the setback by recruiting no less than Dan Carter to pick up the baton after the World Cup. While he called it a ‘tough decision’, the issue of work-load at key times was decisive for Sexton. ‘I have found it extremely difficult to play in the Six Nations and come back in between games to play here,’ he said. ‘I was playing Top 14 games while all the other Irish boys were resting in camp.’ The additional demands have put a strain on him, but Sexton has managed to juggle his duties effectively, to keep Racing in the hunt in the Top 14 and Champions Cup, and help Ireland retain their Six Nations title, in dramatic fashion – once again edging out England on points-difference. He described Super Saturday; the culmination of this year’s championship, as the ‘best day in a green jersey’ for himself and many of his Test colleagues. Talisman Sexton helped Ireland retain the Six Nations title this year . All the trophies and medals and plaudits haven’t quelled the fire in him. Asked to address criticism of Ireland’s often pragmatic tactics in the Six Nations – and a lack of tries prior to the torrent against Scotland on the final day – Sexton offered a defiant retort. ‘There were areas of weakness (in the opposition) that we looked to target,’ he said, referring to an effective Irish kicking game. ‘After the first three games, there was a perception that we were kicking the arse off the ball, but Joe (Schmidt, Ireland’s coach) said to us that we had passed the ball more than any other team in the competition. Sometimes perception and reality are miles apart. We showed what we could do with ball in hand against Wales but we were a bit inaccurate. Then it clicked against Scotland.’ If it clicks again for Ireland at the World Cup, they have a growing belief that – driven on by their Lion at No 10 – they can mount a genuine challenge for the Webb Ellis Cup. But first, Sexton will focus on signing off from Racing with something to show for his time there. The CV has already been embellished this year, but there may be further entries to follow.","Johnny Sexton has featured in 11 Euro knock-out games and won the lot .

It has added to speculation Pearson will be sacked by Leicester with the club sitting bottom of the Barclays Premier League, but Allardyce feels his former colleague has done an 'unbelievable job'. 'He's his own man. He has his own methods and believes in not only himself but what he is doing,' Allardyce said. 'Occasionally as we all get under pressure, we may make odd comments or the odd mistake, but we're human beings like everybody else. 'He's done an unbelievable job, not just at Leicester but as a manager.' Leicester are seven points from safety, albeit with a game in hand against leaders Chelsea, but Allardyce feels Pearson will be frustrated because their performances do not warrant their lowly position.

'Why have those performances not given them more results? That's the cruciality of the Premier League. 'On occasion his team have been in the ascendency. They have not taken advantage of it by not scoring or converting chances. They've paid the ultimate price in the end. That's this level for you.

"Skipper John O'Shea has challenged Sunderland to keep their fate in their own hands by securing a fifth successive derby victory over Newcastle. The Wear-Tyne rivals meet at the Stadium of Light on Sunday with Sunderland having won the last four meetings, but in grave need of three points to ease themselves away from the developing battle for Barclays Premier League survival. O'Shea and his team-mates could find themselves inside the relegation zone by the time they run out if Burnley get the better of Tottenham in the day's earlier kick-off, and that would make three points a necessity. John O'Shea, pictured playing for Ireland at the weekend, wants a fifth straight derby win against Newcastle . The Black Cats captain celebrates scoring against Newcastle in the Tyne-Wear derby of 2012 . The Republic of Ireland international told SAFSee: 'That's the big issue: whoever we were facing this weekend, be in Newcastle, be it Crystal Palace, be it Southampton, whoever the case may be, it's a case of getting the three points as soon as we can and getting everyone energised again and looking forward to the remaining games. 'Look, we know we're not in the position that we'd like to be in, but we know we can get out of it. It's in our hands.' After a dreadful run of results against their arch-rivals, the Black Cats have fared rather well in recent times, winning the last three at St James' Park and the most recent game on Wearside. Asked what lay behind that run of results, O'Shea said: 'Staying together as a unit, keeping the team spirit strong, working as a unit all over the pitch and taking chances. 'Making sure we got clean sheets and also whether it was early or late in the game, making sure we took chances - they were the keys, and obviously having a strong squad as well because there were a couple of times where there were changes in the line-up before games.

'Everyone has got to be mentally prepared to start the game, and obviously anything can happen then in the 90 minutes. 'Look, it's one of those things, we have a chance of creating a fantastic record against a big rival, the main rival for us, so it's a fantastic opportunity.

"Stoke boss Mark Hughes is in no doubt it is high time the club brought their run of fruitless trips to Stamford Bridge to an end. Since gaining promotion to the Barclays Premier League in 2008, the Potters have played Chelsea away eight times in all competitions and lost on every occasion. They did win their last visit to the Londoners' ground previous to that, a League Cup triumph in 1995, but it is not since a 1-1 draw between the two sides in 1984 that Stoke have claimed a point there.

Adding to that in Saturday's 5.30pm clash at the stadium certainly looks a tall order - leaders Chelsea have won 11 and drawn three of their 14 home league games this season. But Hughes, who has seen his 10th-placed side notch victories at the likes of Manchester City and Tottenham already this term, is adamant Stoke must address their poor Stamford Bridge record. Former Chelsea striker Hughes said: 'It's not easy. Our record there hasn't been great - but that could be said of most clubs in the Premier League recently. 'I'm told that the last time we got a positive result there (in the league) was 1984 and my first-team coach (Eddie Niedzwiecki) was in goal for Chelsea.

"Newcastle will be keen to avoid a third defeat on the spin when they take on rivals Sunderland in Sunday’s crunch derby after floundering in recent weeks without banned striker Papiss Cisse. It is Dick Advocaat’s side who are struggling at the foot of the Barclays Premier League table – sitting perilously one point above the bottom three - but Sportsmail can reveal that John Carver’s team would be two points ADRIFT of their foes in the relegation zone if it weren’t for Cisse’s goals. The Senegal forward is Newcastle’s top scorer this season with 11 goals, with 10 of those decisive in changing games in the Magpies’ favour. Papiss Cisse is Newcastle's top scorer this season with 11 goals - 10 of those were decisive . 20 September Hull (h) 2-2 (2 goals) 4 October Swansea (a) 2-2 (2 goals) 2 December Burnley (a) 1-1 (1 goal) 6 December Chelsea (h) 2-1 (2 goals) 26 December Man Utd (a) 1-3 (1 goal) 28 December Everton (h) 3-2 (1 goal) 11 February Crystal Palace (a) 1-1 (1 goal) 28 February Aston Villa (h) (1 goal) Since his double against Hull rescued a 2-2 draw in September, Cisse has earned Newcastle 11 points with his goalscoring heroics — almost single-handedly lifting them to mid-table. Take those goals away and the Premier League reads somewhat differently. Newcastle languish in 18th place on 24 points in the fantasy table behind Sunderland on 26. They would have scored just 22 times — the second fewest in the division behind Aston Villa — and won only six games. Six of Cisse’s strikes have been against sides in the bottom half and Burnley, Hull, Everton, and Villa would have leapfrogged a Newcastle side shorn of the striker. After his brace against Steve Bruce’s side, Cisse scored another double to clinch a 2-2 draw against Swansea two weeks later. His next goal was a second-half equaliser in a 1-1 with Burnley in December and, four days later, hit another two to seal a 2-1 victory over Chelsea. Later that month he netted in a 3-2 triumph over Everton while in February he scored against his former manager Alan Pardew at Crystal Palace in a 1-1 draw. Cisse also supplied the cutting edge to snatch a 1-0 victory against Villa. The Senegalese striker is currently serving a seven-game ban after clashing with Jonny Evans . 5 April Sunderland (a) 13 April Liverpool (a) 19 April Tottenham (h) 25 April Swansea (h) 2 May Leicester (a) His only goal which hasn’t had affected the outcome of a match was a late consolation penalty in a 3-1 defeat at Old Trafford on Boxing Day. Even when Cisse hasn’t found the net, however, he still has a beneficial impact. Newcastle have a points-to-games ratio of 1.37 when the striker plays but just 0.9 when he doesn’t. In reality, there is little cause for concern as Carver’s side currently sit 10 points clear of the drop zone. But after their trip to the Stadium of Light they will face top-four chasing Liverpool and Tottenham in the coming weeks. Newcastle will be hoping they aren’t looking over their shoulders when Cisse returns for their final three games of the campaign.

"Dick Advocaat will welcome 'controller' Lee Cattermole back to the heart of his Sunderland team as he attempts to launch another late survival bid with a record fifth successive derby victory. The 27-year-old enforcer has missed the last two games through suspension after reaching 10 bookings for the season, and that meant he was unavailable for the Dutchman's first game in charge, a 1-0 defeat at West Ham on March 21. However, Cattermole was the only man told he will definitely start against Newcastle on Sunday during Friday's team meeting, and Advocaat is looking for a big response from a player who has once again missed a significant proportion of the campaign to date through injury. Dick Advocaat will welcome back Lee Cattermole after the midfielder missed the defeat to West Ham United . The Sunderland manager has confirmed that Cattermole will definitely start the game against Newcastle . He said: 'He was the only one I told at the team meeting this morning that he will play, so he knows. 'Definitely they missed him because he did not play for 10 or 11 games. He had 10 weeks out - that's quite a long time. 'He is the controller of the team and a player with experience, so for the team it is good, not only as a player, but also as a person, that he's back in the team.' Cattermole's return could hardly be more timely with Sunderland sitting just a point clear of the Barclays Premier League relegation zone with eight games to play and in desperate need of a repeat of their heroics at the end of last season if they are to avoid another desperate scrap for top-flight survival. Advocaat and coach Paul Bracewell discuss tactics during training ahead of the clash with Newcastle . Cattermole and his team-mates share a joke during training as they prepare to face their fiercest rivals . Former Middlesbrough and Wigan man Cattermole played his part in a remarkable escape 12 months ago, and while he insists the picture has not been as black as has been painted at times, he knows the time for action rather than talking has arrived. Cattermole said: 'We haven't played too badly all season, really. There's been the odd bad performance which has killed us, but we just need to start getting over the line and winning some games. There's not really much else to say on the matter. 'We need to get some confidence. We haven't hit a roll all season, we did at the end of last season. It's always been a draw, a draw, then maybe a win, and we have never got anything going. Cattermole played his part in a remarkable escape from relegation for the Black Cats just 12 months ago . Cattermole has yet again missed large portions of Sunderland's season through injury . 'This is a good time to maybe get something going and finish the season with a bit of a bang.' Cattermole has played in two of Sunderland's four consecutive wins over their neighbours, including the 1-0 victory at St James' Park in December, and an extension of that record would send spirits soaring on Wearside. The Black Cats have never before enjoyed five wins on the trot over the Magpies, but while acknowledging the importance of the fixture, Advocaat - a veteran of the Old Firm derby as well as similar rivalries in Holland and Russia - is refusing to be distracted by the opposition this weekend. He said: 'It's nice, but the past doesn't count anymore. We don't get more points because of the last four games. Will Buckley and some of the Sunderland squad share the ball around during a training session . Sunderland players battle for the ball as the Black Cat prepare of their clash against Newcastle United .

This, of course, because it's Newcastle is special, but we still need points and we still have only eight games left, so in that way, it's very important that we can show our fans that we really want to win. 'If we can get them behind us, it can be a very important weapon.' While Advocaat has been boosted by Cattermole's return, he will be without central defender Wes Brown, who faces up to a month on the sidelines with a knee injury.

The last time Celtic reached the Champions League group stage, in 2013-14 when they faced AC Milan, Ajax and Barcelona, they won one match and earned £12.6m. The same performance – or better – next season would see that sum rise by £4m. If they reach the last 16, the figures crash through the £20m barrier. And that’s even before ticket sales. UEFA's increase in Champions League money gives Celtic manager Ronny Deila extra reasons to qualify . To the rest of Scottish football, the prospect of Celtic making more money is damaging to any hopes of increased competition. To Deila, it’s a different kind of bind. ‘It is even more pressure,’ conceded the Norwegian as his side seek to stretch their Premiership lead to eight points against St Mirren in Paisley tonight. ‘But you can’t think about money. You just have to do the job the best way you can. ‘I feel if we can keep consistency in this team and maybe add a player or two, we will be ready for it. ‘It’s not only about the money. It’s about the supporters and the reputation of the club. It’s about the experience of the Champions League.’ The experience and the cash effectively go hand in hand. If Celtic participate in the group stages of the premier competition, sell-out crowds of 60,000 – something of a rarity these days – are guaranteed. The competition stimulates and sustains the club in a variety of ways. Yes, the last 32 of the Europa League secured a tie with Inter Milan this season. But for all the concerns about a small elite from the major leagues dominating the competition every year, the Champions League remains the superior competition in every way. ‘The Champions League is so important,’ added Deila yesterday. ‘We want to win the league and get into the Champions League group stage, that’s the main target. ‘There is even more money now in the Champions League. So to get a good team to compete in that tournament is everything. It is more important than selling players. ‘Our prime target is the Champions League and we have to do what is best for the club.’ Towards that end, Deila - now a more confident and assured figure than the man who took the Parkhead job last summer - will assume personal control of the pre-season programme and argue for the retention of key players. The days of Celtic jetting to the east coast of Australia and back to play friendlies appear to have gone. ‘We have to be more prepared than we were this season,’ stated the Parkhead boss after insisting that last summer’s lucrative series of games in the United States, Austria and Germany had been partly to blame for his team’s subsequent 4-1 qualifying defeat to Legia Warsaw in Poland. ‘I know we are going to be more prepared. They are knockout ties in the qualifiers, so anything can happen. ‘We just need to do everything as good as possible so that the preparation is 100 per cent. ‘We have to do what is best for the team. If we don’t reach it (the group stages) then we will have done everything we can. If we are not good enough then we have to look for a new coach then.’ He was only half joking, you suspect. The most important games of a Celtic season now take place in mid-July, before they have kicked a ball in domestic competition. The Champions League qualifiers set the tone for the rest of the campaign. Amid those circumstances, finding the time to rest international players is proving increasingly difficult. Scotland play the Republic of Ireland in a vital European qualifier in Dublin on June 13, when more than a few Celtic stars are likely to be involved, while the likes of full-back Emilio Izaguirre will also be playing for their countries through the summer. By this time last year, Celtic had won the Scottish title at a canter - allowing former manager Neil Lennon to grant key players early rest prior to the Euro challenge ahead. Deila says that won’t happen this time, even if his side can find a way to shake off challengers Aberdeen in the coming weeks. ‘No. Everybody is going to be here,’ said the Norwegian boss. ‘Hopefully we are going to win the Treble and that is the main target. ‘Our dream and hope is to get to the Scottish Cup Final and win it. If we do that, then we will be playing our last game of this season on May 30. ‘After the cup final, the players will get three weeks’ holiday. If they are playing internationals in June, then they will get one week more. So players like Broony (Scott Brown) and Stefan (Johansen) would come back on July 1. ‘In three weeks, you can’t ruin too much. It is just positive for their bodies to rest. They know what is coming when they come back to training.’ Before then, there are big barriers to cross. Beginning tonight just down the road in Paisley against a demoralised and struggling St Mirren side who find themselves propping up the Premiership table. Deila admits he is eager to secure a fourth consecutive league title for Celtic as soon as possible . ‘We want to win the league as soon as possible,’ declared Deila. ‘The games coming up now are important games but we have a good momentum now. We play good football, we train well, there is good harmony in the squad. I am comfortable that we are going to keep performing well. ‘I expect a good performance at St Mirren. We have a lot of players who have been rested a lot. They should be ready for the game.’","UEFA have confirmed a significant hike in Champions League prize money .

"Tottenham defender Ben Davies will allow no room for sentiment up against Wales team-mate Sam Vokes at Burnley on Sunday. Spurs head to Turf Moor looking to sustain a decent run following just one defeat, at Manchester United, from four Barclays Premier League matches before the international break as they look to keep alive hopes of European qualification. Burnley, meanwhile, are scrapping for survival, currently 18th, but just a point from safety. Burnley's Sam Vokes celebrates scoring against Tottenham in the FA Cup earlier this season, with Spurs defender Ben Davies turning away following the Clarets' equaliser in the third round at Turf Moor . Davies chases a loose ball for Tottenham along with Chelsea's Willian earlier this season in a Barclays Premier League clash at Stamford Bridge which the Blues won 3-0 . Clarets forward Vokes and full-back Davies were part of the Wales team which beat Israel 3-0 in their Euro 2016 qualifying tie. However, Davies maintains there can be no quarter given should he get the chance of a first Spurs appearance since the 2-1 win at QPR. 'I have played alongside Sam with Wales for a good couple of years now and it is always strange coming up against somebody who is normally a team-mate, but regardless of that Burnley is a tough place to go,' Davies said on Tottenham's official website. 'Burnley are a well-organised team and they can make it very difficult for their opponents. They have taken points off some big teams this year, so we need to go there and make sure that we are focused and be wary of the threats that they have got.' With points at a premium at both ends of the table, Davies knows what is at stake over the run-in. Sam Vokes attempts to fire a shot in on goal for Wales as Israel's Tal Ben Haim lunges in during Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier in Haifa . Davies was also part of the Wales team which triumphed in Israel (right) as he slides in to block a cross . 'Everybody is fighting for something. Every team needs the points at this stage of the season and they want to win every game they can,' the defender added. 'It is going to be no different on Sunday. We are going there and we have got to be ready to match their challenge.' Dutch goalkeeper Michel Vorm is set to deputise for Hugo Lloris, who has a knee injury. Full-back Danny Rose will be assessed after returning early from an England call-up with hamstring and hip issues. Spurs had some 13 players away on senior international duty, with striker Harry Kane again impressing for the Three Lions, scoring on his debut against Lithuania at Wembley, while Andros Townsend netted an equaliser against Italy in Turn on Tuesday night, when midfielder Ryan Mason made his bow. Manager Mauricio Pochettino believes the squad can take that positive mood back into domestic duty. He said: 'It has been a very good week for Tottenham. The English players and others with their international teams have put in good performances. They are all fit and at a very good level too. 'It is always difficult after the international break, but we need to make it a good performance and win the game.'","Burnley host Tottenham  in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday .
