"Ethiopian Airlines passengers were forced to endure a frustrating experience when their plane had to divert to Mumbai’s primary airport twice on the same day. Indian media reported that the Boeing 777-300ER first diverted to Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport to refuel about eight hours into its flight from southern China to Addis Ababa. After topping up it departed for Bole International Airport in the Ethiopian capital, but was forced to return after the flight crew declared an emergency shortly after take-off. A 10-hour flight turned into a lengthy delay as an Ethiopian Airlines plane diverted twice to Mumbai . Flight ET607 was carrying 283 passengers and 14 crew members from Guangzhou, China when it had to change course and refuel in Mumbai at about 4:15am local time yesterday. The twin-engine plane departed for Ethiopia at 7:30am, but was forced to turn back as it flew over the Arabian Sea. It made an emergency landing in Mumbai due to engine trouble, Mid-Day reported. The plane was taken out of service for an inspection and any necessary repairs, meaning passengers were forced to disembark and enter the airport terminal. After stopping to refuel the Boeing 777-300ER, travelling from Guangzhou, China, departed for Addis Ababa . The plane turned around over the Arabian Sea and returned due to engine trouble, Indian media reported . They had to go through customs before being transferred to a hotel approximately 12 hours after their original departure, Mid-Day reported. The flight to Addis Ababa was supposed to arrive in a little more than 10 hours without any stops. MailOnline Travel has contacted Ethiopian Airlines for comment. The flight diversions occurred just days after the state-owned carrier was named one of the world’s most reliable airlines. Travel website WanderBrat put Ethiopian Airlines sixth on its list, with Qatar Airways claiming top spot thanks to its flight punctuality, modern fleet and minimal surcharges for passengers.","Plane was flying from Guangzhou, China to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia .

"Connected: Mohammed 'Jihadi John' Emwazi came in contact with Hizb ut-Tahrir while studying at Westminster University . An extremist Islamist group with a 'big UK support base' has joined forces with al-Qaeda in Syria, according to reports. Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT) has reportedly attacked civil activists in Aleppo alongside local al-Qaeda franchise Nusra Front, the Times has revealed. Several British men linked to ISIS, including Mohammed 'Jihadi John' Emwazi, are known to have been in contact with the group while studying at UK universities. Maajid Nawaz, the Liberal Democrats' Parliamentary candidate which the Daily Mail revealed to have been trying to touch a naked lap dancer at an East London strip club, was a member of HT for 13 years and jailed in Egypt for his commitment to the group. A spokesman for Nawaz said he denied touching the dancer ‘inappropriately’ and that the visit to the strip club was part of his stag night. One week ago, around 100 HT members, one armed with a sword, attacked activists in eastern Aleppo during an anti-regime demonstration, The Times reports. A photograph from the demonstration seen by the newspaper allegedly shows 'HT members confronting activists, while balaclava-wearing fighters from the Nusra Front stand guard'. A spokesperson for Hizb ut-Tahrir in the UK denied any involvement with the Nusra Front and al-Qaeda in Syria. Hizb ut-Tahrir (Arabic for Party of Liberation) is an international Muslim organisation which, like ISIS, advocates a single Islamic state, or caliphate, in the Middle East under Islamic law. The group is banned in many Middle East countries and also in Russia, Turkey, Pakistan and Germany but not in Australia, the US or UK. During his 2010 election campaign, David Cameron promised to ban the group, whose UK branch was founded in 1986, but the organisation is still alive and well in Britain. Hizb ut-Tahrir has been known to recruit members at British universities and evidence emerged earlier this year showing the group may have been involved in the radicalisation of ISIS executioner Mohammad Emwazi. Londoner Emwazi, known before his unmasking as 'Jihadi John', is said to have taken part in events at Westminster University where members of HT were among the speakers. Scroll down for video . Converted: Lib Dem candidate Maajid Nawaz, pictured with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, spent 13 years inside Hizb ut-Tahrir and was jailed in Egypt in 2005 for his role in radical Islamist group . Member: Waheed Ahmed, 21, the son of a Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed who was arrested last week trying to cross into Syria, is said to be a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir . Recruiting ground: Several men linked to ISIS are known to have been in contact with Hizb ut-Tahrir while studying at British universities . Four years ago, a student connected to HT was elected president of the Students’ Union at the central London university. His vice-president also had links to the group, which raised concerns that the union had been taken over by extremists. Waheed Ahmed, 21 – the son of Rochdale Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed who was arrested in Turkey last month trying to cross into Syria with eight other Brits - is said to be a member after being recruited as a student at Manchester University. Lib Dem candidate Nawaz, prospective MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, spent 13 years inside Hizb ut-Tahrir and was jailed in Egypt in 2005 for his role in radical Islamist group. On his return to England in 2006, the 37-year-old renounced his views and set up 'counter-extremism think-tank' the Quilliam Foundation. This follows revelations by the Daily Mail this morning that the would-be MP was filmed trying to touch an exotic dancer during several private sessions at a strip club in Whitechapel, east London. Despite his prominent position in the local Muslim community, Nawaz - a married father-of-one - visited the 'gentlemen's club' during the holy month of Ramadan, the owner says. Up close: Would-be MP Maajid Nawaz with a scantily-clad lap dancer in the club in east London . Seedy: The married father-of-one asked for two private sessions at a strip club in east London . Staff said Nawaz had been pestering the girl all night and his actions had been ‘outrageous’ Nawaz can be seen repeatedly trying to make contact with the girl as she dances naked for him . Footage shows Nawaz– who calls himself a feminist and advocate of women’s rights – attempting to touch the young dancer's arms and thighs, which is against the venue’s policy. Staff said Nawaz had been pestering the girl all night and his actions had been ‘outrageous’. In the film, Nawaz can be seen repeatedly trying to make contact with the girl as she dances naked for him in a private room during two £20 lap dances. Owner Abdul Malik, the club’s owner, said he wanted the video to be seen by the public because of the way Nawaz portrays himself as a feminist and a family man. ‘He’s always talking about religion on TV and I thought, what a hypocrite,’ he said. He claimed ‘arrogant’ Nawaz acts like a ‘spokesman for Islam’ – but visited the club during Ramadan. Tory MP Nadine Dorries last night called for Nawaz to quit his candidacy. ‘In politics, you can’t advocate one cause or manner of behaviour then act differently in your personal life,’ she said. Labour MP Khalid Mahmood added: ‘The message this sends to women is not one of respect.’","Islamist extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir 'join al-Qaeda franchise in Syria'

"Two Georgia corrections officers have resigned after a photo emerged on Facebook last week depicting a badly beaten inmate with a leash around his neck flanked by his suspected tormentors. The teenage victim, Cortez Berry, was serving time at the Burruss Correctional Training Center in Forsyth, Georgia, for his role in a 2011 carjacking and robbery. The disturbing image was uploaded to Facebook Friday using a cellphone that had been sneaked into the jail. It shows the 18-year-old Berry  hunched down with a swollen eye in front of two shirtless young men, one of whom is holding the leash. Scroll down for video . In the disturbing photo which was uploaded to Facebook on Friday, Cortez Berry can be seen hunched down with a swollen eye in front of two shirtless young men, one who is holding the leash . Demetria Harris is calling for immediate action after a photo showing her badly beaten son with a leash around his neck taken at a Georgia correctional facility appeared on Facebook . 'I was like oh my God! What happened? How'd it happen? It's a terrifying picture to see,' Berry's mother, Demetria Harris, told WRDW last week. In a statement Monday, Georgia corrections officials said Berry has been removed from Burruss Correctional Training Center and placed in protective custody at Macon State Prison. The teenager initially was transferred to the notoriously violent Smith State Prison, sparking an outrage among his relatives. Two Burruss inmates involved in the photo incident were also removed from Burruss. The Georgia Department of Corrections has not released the names of the two jail guards who stepped down from their posts in the aftermath of the Facebook scandal citing an ongoing investigation. Friend Connie Kennedy told The Augusta Chronicle the Berry family want the state to release Cortez because they fear his fellow inmates will target him once he's out of protective custody. Cortez Berry was visited by his aunt on Saturday and he told her that he had been jumped by ten people who beat him and 'choked him to sleep.' 'Pretty much they left him there for dead,' said Shavondria Wright. The incident happened at 3:15 p.m. but he was left unchecked by the guards until 9:45 p.m. that night, she said. 'No one deserves this,' said Harris. 'They're not being protected. I don't care what they're there for, they still need to be protected.' The attack also appears to be gang related. The caption of the photo posted on Facebook reads: 'When you disrespect the Nation, it brings nothing but pain and suffering.' That is understood to be a reference to the gang, G.D. Nation, short for 'gangsta disciples.' Video courtesy of CBS46.com . Berry told visiters on Saturday that he had been jumped by ten people who beat him and 'choked him to sleep' The Department of Corrections is carrying out an investigation into the incident and has the area of the center where the photo was taken under lockdown. Inmates are not supposed to have access to cellphones. Berry is serving an 8 1/2-year sentence for aggravated battery, robbery and theft of a motorvehicle. He was transfered to the medium security detention center last year after violating his probation. His family say they want an assurance from the department that he will be able to pay his debt to society, without being killed. 'We could've lost him. He could've been dead. Especially when they hung the belt around his neck. He could've just been gone,' said Wright. Berry's aunt Shavondria Wright said the family are thankful that he wasn't killed in the incident but they want him to be able to pay his debt to society in safety .","Disturbing photo shows Cortez Berry  hunched down with a swollen eye in front of two shirtless young men, one of whom is holding a leash .

"For more than 2,000 years, invaders have been fighting over glorious Kefalonia. Romans, the Kingdom of Naples, the Venetian Republic, the Ottoman Empire, the French, British and, during the Second World War, the Italians and Germans have all left their mark. Fortunately, the present settlers - the Greeks themselves and the odd expat - have stoutly resisted the encroachment of mass tourism. So instead of fast-food restaurants you will find charming family-run tavernas that make this island a foodie heaven. Great forests of pines, cypress and cedars still sweep down the steep hillsides, often ending in cliffs of chalk as white as those at Dover, or in fine shingle and sand beaches, fringing a sea whose warm, sun-reflecting waters are of startling clarity. The famous curve of Myrtos beach, as well as many little inland villages, are seen on the road to Fiscardo . Inland, the roads, winding around mountains whose accessible slopes are swathed in olive groves and vineyards are blessedly free of excessive traffic. We landed at the island's only airport near the capital town of Argostoli, took a five-minute walk to the car-rental office and were quickly on our way to the village of Spartia on the southern coast - our first base of a two-centre holiday. Richard Johnson rejoices in unspoiled Kefalonia . We were staying first at the superb Villa Hephaestus. The view from our shady veranda was wonderful - indeed, my American wife called it 'awesome'. The sweep of Lourdas Bay, with its long sandy beaches, was spread out below us, while the neighbouring island of Zakynthos could be seen in the misty distance. Hephaestus is a modern villa with a well-equipped kitchen, and we love to cook. However, after a long day travelling, we decided we needed restorative cocktails, a carafe of white wine and a good fish dinner. Not fancying driving along twisting lanes, we called a taxi to take us to the beautifully situated and highly regarded Water Way restaurant at Spartia beach. The proprietor is a local fisherman, so the best of his catch goes to the kitchen, which is presided over by his wife, while his charming daughter Tepsi is in charge of front of house. From Lourdas Bay you can see Zakynthos Island, where the beautiful Shipwreck Beach (pictured) is found . A sweeping view across the turquoise waters of Lourdata Bay and the white stands of Lourdas Beach . The island is replete with diverse things to see on day trips but the nightlife is virtually non-existent, so we decided to stay home in the evenings and explore during the day. We checked out the string of beaches around Lourdas Bay and found plenty of good restaurants. At the top of a flight of easy steps from Lourdas beach, we found Lorraine's Magic Hill restaurant, with superb food lovingly prepared by the eponymous owner with ingredients from her husband's organic farm. The portions are generous and there's a great view across the bay to fellow Ionian isle Zakynthos. The popular Skala beach is just at the end of the bay. The Metaxa Beach Bar is a good place for coffee and the area is lined with tavernas. We shopped for supplies for our evening meals at Argostoli's port. One can buy catch-of-the-night fish straight from the boats that line the quay (park where you like, for free). The popular golden Skala beach is just at the end of the bay with the nearby Metaxa Beach Bar good for coffee . The town of Argostoli's port is ideal for picking up supplies, including catch-of-the-night fish  from the boats . Enjoyable excursions to the countryside took us to the ruined hilltop castle of St George, near Peratata, and the monastery of St Ayos. At both places entrance is free, and don't miss the Castle cafe just outside the gates. Its enthusiastic proprietors are Greek/English and serve superior food in a shady garden. The Monastery of Saint Geronimo is situated in a vine-clad valley north-east of the castle. It was rebuilt in Byzantine-style in the 1960s, the original having been destroyed during a 1953 earthquake. The walls of the interior are decorated in exuberant style with biblical scenes, and a huge candelabra hangs from the ceiling. We loved our stay in the south, but for the second week of our stay it was time to take the 35-mile drive to Fiscardo, on the island's north cape. The trip afforded superb views of the coast - including the famous curve of Myrtos beach - as well as many little inland villages. Fiscardo, once a remote fishing port, has been transformed into a world-class yachting centre, with smart restaurants and boutiques jostling for every inch of the quayside. The second week of our stay was a 35-mile drive away in the fishing village of Fiscardo , in the island's north . 'It's like St Tropez in the old days,' I mused. Our villa, Island View, is set on the hillside overlooking the port. From its verandas and infinity pool the neighbouring islands of Ithaca - mythical home of Odysseus - and Lefkas could be seen through the shimmering sea mist. We found some attractive beaches a few minutes' drive from Fiscardo. Our two favourites were Agia Jerusalem and Alaties, both reached by turning right out of the village of Maganos and following the signs. Agia Jerusalem is considered a 'secret' place, peaceful even in August. When we visited (in September), fewer than a dozen people were enjoying the sunbeds provided. Agia Jerusalem Beach is considered a 'secret' place, peaceful even in August, and a favourite of the writer . There's an excellent taverna, with fresh fish and dishes from a menu that changes daily. Alaties, on the other hand, is a tiny cove with a miniature beach. It's lovely to swim there. Among the fir trees above the beach is a modern restaurant where fresh prawns can be had. Apart from one afternoon of rain (we were on a boat trip to Lefkas but 30 minutes out of Fiscardo, an unexpected squall hit us and it rained for the remainder of the trip), the weather was perfect. We had a wonderful time with beautiful scenery, great food and fun when we wanted it. I can see why so many people have wanted to invade Kefalonia!","Visited Spartia in the south of Kefalonia and then Fiscardo, in the north .

"Attorney General Eric Holder sent a memo on Friday to Justice Department employees reminding them that soliciting prostitutes is against agency rules and can lead to suspension or firing. His memo came weeks after a scathing inspector general's report found the Drug Enforcement Administration had mishandled allegations that several of its agents went to sex parties with prostitutes. Holder said the department's prohibition on soliciting prostitutes applies even when employees are off duty or in foreign countries where prostitution may be legal. Attorney General Eric Holder sent a memo Friday to DOJ employees reminding them not to solicit prostitutes . An inspector general's report found the DEA mishandled allegations ten agents had sex parties with prostitutes . House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz called the findings 'stunning' The DOJ is investigating the disciplinary process following the accusations of sexual misconduct, Fox News reported. The memo said: 'The solicitation of prostitution threatens the core mission of the Department, not simply because it invites extortion, blackmail, and leaks of sensitive or classified information, but also because it undermines the Department's efforts to eradicate the scourge of human trafficking.' The ten DEA agents - an assistant regional director and nine special agents - had the alleged parties 'at government-leased headquarters,' and three of the special agents 'were provided money, expensive gifts, and weapons from drug cartel members', according to the report. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz called the allegations regarding the DEA agents 'stunning' and urged action. He said: 'We need to hold them accountable and, given the clear evidence in the OIG report, they should be fired immediately.' Although the inspector general's report did not identify the foreign country where the parties took place, it has been confirmed it was Colombia, according to the Washington Post. The inspector general found many sex-related offenses in the case files of the FBI, DEA, ATF and US Marshals . A DOJ spokeswoman said: 'Department leadership takes very seriously the allegations laid out in the IG's report and acted quickly to remind all employees that they are prohibited from participating in commercial sex acts and will be suspended or terminated for violating the policy.' The agencies investigated by the inspector general were the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, DEA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the US Marshals Service. Holder also directed a review of the security clearances of the DEA employees who attended the parties to ensure that they continue to qualify for the clearances. He also called for improvements in how the DEA investigates and handles allegations of misconduct.","Attorney General Eric Holder sent out the memo to DOJ workers on Friday .

"This year has seen a rash of massive dust storms around the world that have led to travel chaos and blocked out sunlight - but experts cannot pinpoint the reason behind the spate. This week incredible footage showed the moment an unusual 'apocalyptic' dust storm, known in Arabic as a haboob, struck Belarus, turning day to night, and China has suffered four massive sandstorms since the start of the year. Some experts have said that climate change bringing excessive heat can make some areas more susceptible to dust storms, but one European scientist pointed out that the number of dust storms over the decades has always been variable. Dark clouds start forming over the city of Soligorsk, Belarus, as a sandstorm sweeps over the city . Within a matter of minutes, the storm had blocked out the sun, creating chaos on the city streets . A raging sand storm sweeps in on the city of Golmud in north west China, where 200,000 people live . The sandstorm was the fourth to hit the area this year as authorities struggle to deal with the natural hazards . China's Meteorlogical Centre issued a blue alert as the sandstorms swept across the north of the country . Golmud was left covered in a remarkable red haze when the sand cloud blew across the city . The footage of the dust storm in Belarus, filmed from a high rise apartment, shows traffic moving along a busy street in the province of Salihorsk, south of the capital of Minsk on Monday afternoon. As dark clouds move over the city, the entire area is plunged into darkness - forcing motorists to turn on their lights as they navigate the darkened roads. The storm was caused by a cold front moving in from the Ukrainian-Belorusian border, reported RT. Earlier this month Britain was shrouded in a cloud of Saharan dust, known as 'blood rain,' as the temperatures soared. Blurred: The Shard, one of London's most iconic buildings, is pictured shrouded in 'blood rain' earlier this month . In December a small town in Queensland, Australia, experienced a dust storm (pictured) that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude . Dr Steven Godby, a geographer researching the effects of blown sand and dust at Nottingham Trent University, explained how these events can occur. 'The dust is produced from source areas in North Africa, incorporated into a northerly airflow and can travel long distances before being deposited as far away as the UK. 'However, the events we experience are small scale compared to those experienced closer to major dust sources. And incredible pictures also taken at the beginning of April showed the moment ferocious red sandstorms  devoured a city in China's north west. China's pollution hit cities are now having to cope with a fresh nuisance - the massive sandstorm that struck the north-west of the country being the fourth this year alone. The images show the city of Golmud, in the country's north west Qinghai Province, as it succumbs to a sweeping half-hour sandstorm which reduced the visibility to as little as 30 metres, according to The People's Daily Online. On April 1 a sandstorm could be seen enveloping much of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . By April 4, it was beginning to stretch across the Arabia Sea towards Pakistan and India . China's National Meteorological Centre (NMC) issued a blue alert for the sandstorms. The red sand swept across the northern part of the country bringing strong winds and floating sand to the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi. The organisation advised residents to stay indoors and local authorities to brace for the clean-up operation after the sandstorms. China's four-tier colour-coded weather warning system signifies red as the most severe followed by orange, yellow and blue. Photos of the city of Dunhuang in the north-western province of Gansu show the thick orange haze coating the city's atmosphere and the lack of people on the streets gave the area an almost alien planet appearance. A local meteorologist said visibility was reduced to less than 50metres in downtown areas. In December a small town in Queensland, Australia, experienced a dust storm that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude. Clouds of dirt engulfed the town of Bedourie, in Queensland's south-west, bringing with it a thick, dusty night for more than 90 minutes. The Middle East has also experienced several huge sandstorms this year. This week Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran experienced severe dust storms and last week the Arabian Peninsula was hit by a sandstorm the size of the U.S. And in February raging sandstorms engulfed Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Egypt causing the worst Israeli air pollution in years and whipping up huge waves in the Mediterranean Sea. The sandstorm hit Egypt after unusually warm and sunny weather for a February day, and the sky over downtown Cairo turned yellow and blotted out the sun, limiting visibility . Hazy: The Egyptian capital was transformed by the sandstorm while Alexandria and nearby Dekheila ports were closed because of the weather . Red alert: The sandstorm in Egypt gave the country a Martian look . The storm, made up of accumulated dust carried from the far reaches of the Sahara Desert in North Africa also engulfed Cairo. Israel's Environmental Protection Ministry said air pollution levels were the country's worst in five years. The sandstorm that engulfed the Arabian Peninsula, meanwhile, wrecked havoc across the area, causing traffic accidents, the cancellation of hundreds of flights and triggering breathing difficulties among residents. Images showed the vast sandstorm sweeping its way across Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates and reaching as far east as India and Pakistan over a period of seven days. It began on April 1, when high winds whipped up the sandstorm in northern Saudi Arabia before it consolidated and began moving southeastward across the peninsula to eventually cover an area almost as large as the United States, Discover Magazine reported. Along the way it caused chaos across the area's major cities including Riyadh and Dubai, where some locations were reduced to zero visibility, streets turned a shade of orange and schools were forced shut. The Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies said: 'The blowing sand reduced surface visibility to near zero at some locations, disrupting ground transportation, air traffic, and also closing schools. Dr Emilio Cuevas-Agulló, director of the Izana Atmospheric Research Center in Tenerife, Spain, told MailOnline that while it was difficult to say if there have been an increase in dust storms generally, population and urban growth in desert regions means an increased risk of people being affected by them. He said: ‘We are more aware of the problem since we have much better monitoring, mainly from satellites, and forecast systems, in the last five to 10 years, and because the population growth and corresponding infrastructures increase in desert and arid regions, in recent decades, increasing vulnerability to the same dust episodes.’ He added: ‘Our longest dust records over the North Atlantic, downwind from the Sahara desert, which started in late 1970s show a great inter-annual variability and decadal changes, but we don't really see positive trends.’ Severely reduced viability caused traffic chaos in Egypt's capital city . 'Visibility was reduced to 0.1 mile for several hours at Dubai International Airport, which is one of the world’s busiest in terms of volume of flights.' More than 450 Saudi Arabian Airlines flights were cancelled between across three days which equalled 33 per cent of the carrier's 1,526 scheduled flights, the Saudi Gazette reported. On top of this, 678 flights were delayed and another 19 rerouted from airports in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam. Dr Emilio Cuevas-Agulló, director of the Izana Atmospheric Research Center in Tenerife, Spain, told MailOnline that while it was difficult to say if there have been an increase in dust storms generally, population and urban growth in desert regions means an increased risk of people being affected by them.

"A virulent strain of bird flu continues to hammer the Midwest and the virus recently took its biggest toll yet after it hit a farm in Iowa that held nearly 10 percent of the state's egg-laying chickens. Poultry producers and scientists had been hoping warmer weather would knock down the deadly bird flu virus. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that the H5N2 bird flu virus had been found at a farm in northwest Iowa's Osceola County - prompting a massive bird cull. Bird flu: Chickens stand in their cages at a farm near Stuart, Iowa. Discovery of the bird flu on an Iowa turkey farm has raised serious concerns that the bird killer could find its way into chicken barns in the nation's top egg-producing state and rapidly decimate the flocks that provide the U.S. with its breakfast staple . The confirmation means up to 5.3 million hens there must be destroyed in a state that produces one in every five eggs consumed in the country. Seven other Midwestern states have also been hit by the virus, dooming nearly 7.8 million turkeys and chickens since March. The virulent strain in question is the H5N2, a highly contagious virus that kills commercial poultry quickly once it gets into a barn. Yet the risk to the public is considered low and infected birds are being kept out of the food supply. So far, only two egg operations have been hit — the one in Iowa and one in Wisconsin. Except for a couple of backyard flocks, all the other cases in the Midwest have been at commercial turkey farms. Minnesota has had 28 turkey farms hit, far more than any other state. Turkey farm: In this photo provided by Bethany Hahn is a flock of turkeys at a Minnesota poultry farm. The country's poultry industry may have to live with a deadly bird flu strain for several years according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture . Precautions: Most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out, and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in - but is does not always protect poultry from bird flu . Officials say that's because Minnesota is the top turkey-producing state, and its thousands of lakes and ponds are attractive to migrating ducks and other waterfowl. H5N2 and other highly pathogenic strains have also been found since late last year among wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial farms in some western states and British Columbia. U.S. Department of Agriculture officials say the virus could be a problem for several years. The USDA's chief veterinary officer, Dr. John Clifford, said last week that while new cases should drop close to zero once the weather warms up and kills off the virus there's 'very likely' to be a resurgence this fall when the wild waterfowl that are natural carriers of avian influenza fly south for the winter. An outbreak that kills tens of thousands of birds certainly can cost a farm dearly. The government doesn't compensate producers for birds that die of the disease itself, but it does reimburse them for birds that have to be euthanized as a precaution. That gives farmers an incentive to report suspected outbreaks and deal with them swiftly. Outbreaks do not always drive up the cost of turkey eggs and chicken as the toll nationwide represents just a small part of U.S. production. Hormel Foods Corp., which owns Jennie-O, said Monday that it will sell less turkey this year because of the outbreaks. Turkey prices around the holidays often have nothing to do with the costs of production. Retailers often sell turkeys at a loss just to draw in customers who'll stock up on stuffing mix, cranberries, sweet potatoes, pies and other traditional favorites. However, several precautions have been put in place at farms to control the outbreak and stop the spread of bird flu. Most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out, and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in. Other precautions  include workers often having to shower on their way in and out, wear protective coveralls and step in disinfectant to kill viruses on their boots. Equipment coming in and out is typically sanitized. But despite these measures, the system doesn't always work. According to experts, the only way it can work is if everyone does everything right all of the time - which can prove difficult. And if rodents and wild birds sneak into a barn it can bring the virus that way. Farms tend to be extremely diligent at handling  bird flu as turkeys die quickly and know how to spit the early warning signs. Less severe symptoms can be similar to colds and flu in humans, or a flock turning quiet. While vaccines have been used around the world to protect flocks against various bird flu strains ahead of time, this strain is new to North America. Once an infection is confirmed at a farm, all surviving birds on the property are typically killed to prevent it from spreading. These flocks are usually killed by pumping a water-based foam into the barn, following guidelines from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The foam suffocates the birds within minutes. If birds die they usually cover them in compost in the same barn where they died. Composting is a widely used and approved method throughout the industry to dispose of dead birds. It's thought to be an effective method as the heat generated by composting is enough to kill flu viruses and other pathogens commonly present in poultry such as salmonella.

"A surrender order issued by Hitler's successor in the final days of the Second World War that was found on the chief of the Luftwaffe when he was arrested is being auctioned 70 years later for £21,000. The typed dispatch – owned by a US collector – was sent by German president Karl Doenitz on May 8, 1945, telling officers to abandon fighting or face the Allies' wrath. It was seized from Luftwaffe chief Robert von Greim when he was arrested that day. The WWI fighter ace then killed himself rather than be tortured by the Russians. The surrender order that is being auctioned is being auctioned by Bonhams, New York . The typed order sent by German president Karl Doenitz is expected to fetch £21,000 when it goes under the hammer . Grand Admiral Doenitz had been Hitler's choice to replace him as leader of the Nazis, a role he assumed following the dictator's suicide on April 30. But a week later, amid a crumbling and defeated Reich, Doenitz met with Allied commanders to sign the instrument of surrender, bringing an end to war in Europe. The following day Doenitz, who had been commander of the German navy up until Hitler's death, sent a telex message to his commanders in the field informing them of the immediate surrender 'to save as many people as possible for Germany'. Describing the action as 'unavoidable', Doenitz instructed officers to abandon all fighting or face the wrath of the Allies. The note read: 'On 7 May 1945 0241, the Supreme Command of the Wehrmacht signed the unconditional surrender of all armed forces on land, on water, and in the air to the Supreme Command of the Allied Expeditionary Forces as well as the Soviet Supreme Command. 'This was unavoidable in order to prevent the complete destruction of certain parts of the front, which was expected to occur in a short time, and, in doing so, to save as many people as possible for Germany. 'Accordingly, on 9 May 1945 0100 GST every ongoing combat activity must be abandoned. 'All officers of the army, navy and the Luftwaffe, as well as troops of the Wehrmacht divisions and the Waffen SS shall remain in their current positions. 'Effective immediately, no maritime vehicle or aeroplane shall be sunk or destroyed, no military equipment may be damaged in any way.' He finished the message with a stark warning that if his officers 'do not act according to the conditions of surrender, the Command of the Allied Expeditionary Forces and Soviet Command will undertake punitive measures or other steps beyond the conditions of surrender.' Von Greim, 52, a WWI fighter ace, had been put in charge of the Luftwaffe after Hitler turned on Herman Goering accusing him of treason. Railing against his former comrades, Hitler summoned von Greim to Berlin and ordered him to hunt down and kill Gestapo chief Heinrich Himmler who he believed had tried to harbour a peace deal with the Allies. The order was seized from Luftwaffe chief Robert von Greim when he was arrested that day . Von Greim escaped Berlin in a camouflaged plane and his actions thereafter are unknown until he was arrested in Austria by US troops on May 8. On his arrest, Von Greim admitted to his captors: 'I am the head of the Luftwaffe, but I have no Luftwaffe'. He was taken to Salzburg and was due to be handed over to the Soviets but committed suicide by taking a cyanide pill on May 24. The note is one of the only copies of Doenitz's dispatch known to exist today. It is tipped to fetch £21,000 when it goes under the hammer at Bonhams auction house on behalf of a private collector from the US. Tom Lamb, an expert in military history at Bonhams, said: 'The story behind this document is an incredible one. 'Hitler was in his bunker in Berlin a few days prior to his death and he called von Greim, one of his closest and most trusted allies. 'Von Greim was flown in to Berlin amid all the fighting. That evening Hitler launched a rant about how his right hand man Heinrich Himmler had betrayed him. 'Hitler ordered von Greim to go and kill Himmler for treason then take control of the Luftwaffe following the treason of Goering. 'Von Greim left immediately in his camouflaged plane and amazingly managed to escape out of Berlin without being caught. 'He was supposed to go to Plon in northern Germany to track down Himmler but he was arrested on May 8, the same day as the German surrender, by US troops in Austria. 'Hitler had committed suicide a week earlier and Admiral Doenitz had taken charge. On May 7 1945 Doenitz had signed the instrument of surrender and the following day he sent his high command a dispatch informing them. 'Doenitz warned that if the Germans didn't stop fighting they would be killed by the Americans or the Russians. 'He understood the end had come and he was telling his high command to make sure everyone knew that. 'The telegram from Doenitz was found on Von Griem when he was arrested. 'Von Greim was then taken to Salzburg where he was due to be part of a Soviet-US prisoner exchange but fearing torture at the hands of Stalin he took his own life with a cyanide pill. 'Copies of the surrender note from Doenitz are exceptionally rare - many were lost or destroyed but somehow this one survived. 'This document is incredibly important in the history of the 20th century.' The auction will take place in New York on April 29.","Typed dispatch sent by German president Karl Doenitz on May 8, 1945 .

"Nick Clegg will today promise the highest education spending of any party with a £5billion flagship offer to undecided voters. At the launch of their manifesto today, the Liberal Democrats will vow to protect the entire education budget in the next parliament ‘from cradle to college’. Unlike Tory and Labour plans, spending would rise per pupil – with an extra 460,000 schoolchildren expected in the next five years – and also in line with inflation from 2018. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg (left) will today promise the highest education spending of any party with a £5billion flagship offer to undecided voters. His wife Miriam is pictured in Marple, Greater Manchester yesterday . It is understood that Mr Clegg will say this is a deal-breaker in any future coalition talks after May 7, in order to win over ‘centre-ground’ Conservative voters worried about funding cuts for schools. Education is a sore point for many who backed the Lib Dems in 2010 on the promise that the party would scrap tuition fees and then saw them trebled to £9,000 per year. But Mr Clegg will claim the Lib Dems are now ‘the party of education’ and the school funding commitment is firm because it will be on the front page of today’s manifesto of pledges. The tuition fees pledge was not on the front page in 2010, and the Lib Dem leader said those which were, such as increasing the income tax allowance, he had stuck ‘doggedly, religiously’ to. Protecting the education budget in real terms for children aged two to 19, will cost an additional £5billion a year more than the Conservatives plan to spend, and £2.5billion a year more than Labour. It would kick in from 2018-19, after the deficit has been cleared under Lib Dem plans and be funded by the proceeds of economic growth. Mr Clegg will claim the Lib Dems are now ‘the party of education’ and the school funding commitment is firm because it will be on the front page of today’s manifesto of pledges . In a pitch to Tory voters in battleground areas such as the South West, Mr Clegg will say people ‘are right to distrust the Conservatives on education’. ‘Our manifesto has one simple ambition and word at its heart, opportunity’, he said last night. ‘It’s the very old liberal idea that every should be able to live out their life to the full regardless of the circumstances of the circumstances of their birth, of the income of his or her parents or where they come from. ‘Education is the great liberator of people’s potential so we need to make sure we support the education system in the next Parliament. ‘The great challenge is we have more and more young people coming into our education system, so we need to make sure that the money is there to educate every single pupil even as their numbers increase. ‘We are determined to make sure that every child in Britain has a world class education.’ The money would be spent on qualified teachers in every classroom, training more teachers, more classes in small groups or one to one and expanding early years education. Speaking on the campaign trail in Lewes in East Sussex, Mr Clegg said he had noticed voters in seats fought between the Tories and Lib Dems were expressing concern about spending on public services. The Tories have matched Lib Dem plans to offer £8billion a year in extra health spending to meet a request from the head of NHS England. By Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent for the Daily Mail . The Green Party would abolish new road building and increase public spending by a fifth to pay for a vast wish-list of commitments, its manifesto revealed yesterday. Leader Natalie Bennett pledged to raise tens of billions in new taxes, including a wealth tax, a 60p higher rate of income tax and imposing VAT and fuel duty on aviation. Launching the 84-page manifesto in trendy Dalston, East London, she said it amounted to a ‘peaceful political revolution’. Proposed policies include protections for the ‘nomadic lifestyle’, a promise to ‘ensure respect for everyone’, and adopting an approach of ‘defensive defence’ while abolishing the Trident nuclear deterrent. The age of criminal responsibility would be raised from ten to 14, cannabis and other drugs legalised, and there would be an amnesty for illegal immigrants here for three years or more. Leader Natalie Bennett pledged to raise tens of billions in new taxes, including a wealth tax, a 60p higher rate of income tax and imposing VAT and fuel duty on aviation . But questions were raised over whether the hikes in taxes on the richest would raise anything like the billions promised. Even manifesto author Brian Heatley admitted the plans were based on ‘a lot of estimation and judgment’. The proposals would see public spending go up by £177billion a year by the end of the Parliament. A new tax would charge anyone with £3million 2 per cent of their wealth, and top earners would pay 60p in the pound. Corporation tax would go up to 30 per cent from 20 per cent, the fuel duty escalator would be restored and capital gains tax allowances abolished. The party promises to scrap the £15billion major roads spending programme, bring in a ‘Citizen’s Pension’ of £180 a week for single OAPs and £310 for a couple, and hugely increase spending on health, social care and social housing. Foreign aid spending would rise by another £6billion a year, child benefit would double, tuition fees would be abolished and pupils would get organic school dinners. Other policies include a promise to end the use of nuclear and coal power stations and ban fracking. Railways would be renationalised, there would be a ban on fur imports, and cages for rabbits and hens in farming would be outlawed.","Nick Clegg vows to protect entire education budget 'from cradle to college'

"Arlette Ricci (above), the multi-millionaire owner of  Nina Ricci, was today sent to prison for trying to hide her fortune from the French taxman through HSBC . The multi-millionaire owner of the Nina Ricci fashion company was today sent to prison for trying to hide her fortune from the French taxman through HSBC bank. Arlette Ricci, 74 and one of the richest women in Europe, was ‘particularly determined’ to stash money in Swiss accounts for more than two decades. A judgement handed down by a Paris criminal court added: ‘The seriousness of the facts are an exceptional threat to the public good.’ Ricci had denied hiding the equivalent of more than £15million, saying she had simply tried to avoid tax – which is legal – rather than evade it, which is not. However, bugged phone conversations between the heiress and her daughter, Margot Vignat, suggested otherwise. According to the transcript, Ms Ricci boasted that she changed banks to escape prosecution and spent the hidden funds on buying a chalet in an upmarket Swiss ski resort. ‘I was never troubled. So I bought a chalet in Klosters, and now it’s fine. There was 2009, 2010, 2011 – it’s been three years so I think I’m free of any type of inspection,’ Ricci was heard to say. Her daughter was heard warning her about the tax authorities, saying: 'Watch out all the same. They're vicious.' But Ricci reassured her, saying: 'Everyone got done but not me. They had to give themselves in and pay a fortune.' The daughter replied: 'Oh, that could cause some damage'. Ricci, in turn, said: 'Yes, of course, because all that is very illegal.' In what will set a legal precedent for other cases of tax fraud through HSBC, Ricci was also fined the equivalent of more than £700,000. Judges also ordered that houses in Paris and on the holiday island of Corsica worth more than £3m be seized. Ricci was accused of transferring the deeds of the properties to family trusts in an attempt to restructure her assets, so as to evade penalties. She was given a total of three years in prison, with two years suspended. Her daughter, 51, was also convicted and given an eight-month suspended sentence. Henri-Nicolas Fleurance, Ricci’s tax adviser, was given a one-year suspended prison sentence and an £8000  fine for attempting to organise her insolvency. Jean-Marc Fedida, one of the defence barristers, said 'justice was done under frenetic, brutal pressure', so as to use a high-profile defendant as a 'warning to all those' with offshore accounts. But he conceded the sentence was 'much lighter' that what the prosecution had asked for. Ricci, who had faced a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, may ask if she can serve the prison term under less strict conditions, including wearing an electronic tag, her lawyers said. The multi-millionaire is the first French national to face trial over tax evasion in what has been dubbed a test case. Her name was among thousands of HSBC clients who were discovered to have non-declared bank accounts in Switzerland. Whistleblower Herve Falciani, a former employee of the bank, passed a list with more than 3,000 names of suspected tax evaders to the French government around six years ago. A BBC Panorama earlier this year further highlighted the issue. The Swiss branch of HSBC is now facing charges of fraud and money laundering after authorities in Brussels claimed it had 'knowingly eased and promoted fiscal fraud by making offshore companies available to certain privileged clients'. While some of the cases were settled 50 other French nationals will also face trial. Her name was among thousands of HSBC clients who were discovered to have non-declared bank accounts in Switzerland. Above, an aerial view of the HSBC tower in London . Her lawyers always argued the fault lay with HSBC in Switzerland, with one insisting in defence documents: 'She was in no way informed about how HSBC decided to structure the organisation of the funds she entrusted it with.' They added that they were considering an appeal against sentence. Ricci was the first of more than 50 high-profile French nationals being pursued in the courts for using Swiss accounts to hide their money. The judgment came after HSBC Holdings was formally placed under criminal investigation for complicity in fiscal fraud and illegal selling via its Swiss arm for two years starting in 2006. Nina Ricci – real name Maria Adelaide Nielli – was an Italian-born clothes designer who settled in France aged 12 in 1895. She died in 1970. Her son Robert, Arlette Ricci’s father, developed the company’s perfume sideline and raised the firm’s international profile. Arlette Ricci inherited his fortune on his death in 1988.","Arlette Ricci denied accusations and said she tried to avoid tax not evade it .

"You would think that all water is created equal, but a raft of new 'enhanced' H20 products shows that things in the water business are changing, and fast. We're no longer happy posing with Perrier, Fiji or Evian branded bottles. Nowadays those in the know are downing bottles of birch, made from the sap of silver birch trees, sipping on glasses of liquid extracted from artichokes or opting for specially harvested and filtered rainwater. Drink up! Forget tap water, we're now being sold a raft of infused and health-boosting H20s . Sweet tasting birch water contains saponins which can help your body absorb less fat . So what makes one type of water better than another? Nutritional Therapist Lorna Driver-Davies explains the health benefits of these new super saps. Artichoke water . According to ARTY, which produces this drink, the water is extracted from Californian artichokes, a plant rich in health-boosting silymarin and cynarin. The water is said to contain minerals including iron, potassium, vitamin C and magnesium. Flavoured with spearmint and apple, the 30-calories per bottle water is sweetened with agave and fruit. Price: £43.55 for a case of 24 235ml-bottles  of ARTY. Expert comment: 'The company doesn't explain their special extraction process so its hard to comment. It seems fairly natural and artichokes are nutritious but I would advise eating them. 'You can also make a broth drink from the left over water are cooking artichokes. 'Perhaps the extraction method doesn't use heat as this might help to keep the nutrients intact. It might be good to drink occasionally but I am sure the potency would be like a medical tincture of powder capsule. 'Personally we should try to reduce our intake of naturally sweetened products as many of us consume far too much sugar and fruit sugar and this product adds fruit juice and agave. Eating whole fruit is more nutritious.' ARTY artichoke water is said to contain minerals including iron, potassium, vitamin C and magnesium . Birch water . Made from the sap of silver birch trees, birch water is meant to be rich in nutrients and contain vitamins A and B. The sweet tasting water, which comes in at 18 calories per 100ml, also contains saponins,which can help your body absorb less fat. Price: Nordic Koivu, £8.99 for 500ml; Sibberi, £3.30 per 300ml . Expert comment: 'Birch water is a very old tradition and I would perhaps recommend it if you liked the taste and wanted nutrient rich water, but I would not go as far to say that it might be cellulite-busting or other health claims. 'Silver birch is used in herbal medicine and it has good health benefits as a natural diuretic or for lymphatic health, but this is likely to be a more concentrated tincture made from bark, leaf and resin.' Cactus water . This contains extract of prickly pear cactus, a plant with levels minerals which can aid the digestive system. It also is high in electrolytes and as a bonus, has betalains, an antioxidant which could help reduce hangover symptoms. Just remember to drink it before you consume alcohol. Price: £49 for a  pack of 12 500ml bottles of True Nopal . Expert comment: 'I am a fan of pure coconut water and certainly notice the difference in my energy and mood if I drink it before a workout or if I am feeling tired I do find it reviving. 'Therefore anything with a good amount of electrolytes seems promising; however I would want to know if its 100 per cent cactus water.' Prickly pear cactus (left)  which contains electrolytes, is the star in cactus water (right) Charcoal water . The Japanese have used Binchotan active charcoal as a water purifier since the 17th century. The charcoal reduces reduces chlorine, mineralises the water and balances the pH. The stick of charcoal can be used for up to six months. Price: £14.95 for a Black + Blum Charcoal Filter water bottle . Expert comment: ''This just appears to be a portable filter, almost a mobile version of a Britta filter. I would imagine this just takes some of the hardness out of tap water release minerals such as calcium, iron and magnesium back into the water. 'I think this is one of the best options as its very cost effective and eco-friendly. I would actually want to try something like this myself considering home filters that remineralise the water are often much more expensive.' Fulvic water . Australian pop siblings Kylie and Dannii Minogue are said to be fans of BLK Fulvic Water, which has 77 trace minerals and electrolytes. The water is infused with fulvic acids which present naturally in peat. Price: £12.98 for four 500ml-bottles of BLK. Expert comment: 'Fulvic acid is often found in the layer of earth that feeds plants. It may have some benefit for us therefore as its like a concentrated trace mineral. 'I think the cost of this product goes beyond the price of a bottle of water, so perhaps this is best used as a course for a couple of months. It would be expensive to use each day.' Spring water infused with fulvic acid (left) and lemon combined with cold-pressed watermelon pulp (right) Maple water . Made from Canadian maple syrup, this water claims to contain 46 health-boosting ingredients including calcium, magnesium and potassium. Price: £2.45 for a 330ml bottle of Seva maple water . Expert comment: 'This sounds similar to birch and indeed, coconut water, so it is probably pleasant to drink and it seems it has similar qualities. 'I am not discounting the product but its potentially more expensive than coconut water which seems very similar. So personally I would stick to coconut water unless I was living in Canada where the maple water is probably cheaper!' Rainwater . Purified rainwater is big business in the US with companies all rushing out to catch, filter, bottle and sell rainwater to punters looking for a natural and ecologically sound liquid boost. Price: Currently not available in the UK although you can get it for £16 ($24) for 12 bottles on www.agana-water.com . Expert comment: 'Rainwater can be safe to drink; In fact this is how many people in countries across the world have access to water (think of remote areas or poorer parts of the world). 'But it would need to be cleaned and filtered. I am not sure of the health benefits and I think it would be more of value to health to drink mineral water, due to mineral content. Watermelon water . Cold pressed raw watermelon flesh, rind and pulp are combined with lemon to make this drink, which is said to contain calcium, vitamin C, potassium, magnesium and sodium. It comes in at 60-calories per bottle and also has lycopene and beta-carotene. Price: £66 for a pack of 12 335ml bottles of WTRMLN WTR . Expert comment: 'I quite like the look of this as a pre-workout or natural energy drink. 'It might be a little similar to coconut water but the nutrition is only like to vary slightly. I think this is  worth trying but as with all these drinks, I wouldn't expect a life changing experience.

"An Egyptian court has sentenced a popular Armenian belly dancer to six months in prison for 'insulting the Egyptian flag' after she wore a tight dress in its red, white and black color scheme. The court in Agouza, west of Cairo, said Sofinar Gourian, popularly known as 'Safinaz', was fined £15,000  after being found guilty in a case raised by a private complainant. She is expected to avoid jail time, however, after paying £10,000 bail and launching an appeal against the six month prison sentence. Offending dress: An Egyptian court has sentenced popular Armenian belly dancer 'Safinaz' to six months in prison for 'insulting the Egyptian flag' after she wore a tight dress in its red, white and black color scheme . Insulting the flag was made illegal by decree under Egyptian President Adly Mansour who ruled for a year after the army overthrew an elected but divisive Islamist president in 2013. The change in law made it a crime to raise, display or sell an Egyptian flag if it is damaged in any way, or even if the colour has faded. The law also prohibits adding slogans, designs or pictures to the Egyptian flag. Ms Gourian is understood to have worn a costume made from the material taken from an Egyptian flag during a belly dancing performance in the town of Ain Sokhna in 2013. The belly dancer, who lives in Egypt, had argued that she did not insult the flag intentionally and as a foreigner was less aware of Egyptian laws. Harsh laws: Insulting the Egyptian flag was made illegal by decree under  President Adly Mansour who ruled for a year after the army overthrew an elected but divisive Islamist president in 2013 . The complaint against her was filed by a businesswoman and hotel owner in Mohandeseen who found the performance insulting, according to Ahram Online. Although she has been convicted of the crime, her £10,000 bail allows her to remain free until her appeal has been heard. Ms Gourian has lived and worked in Egypt for the past two years, where her act has proven to be an immediate success. The Armenian native has already appeared in several Egyptian movies, performed at society weddings and is married to an Egyptian national. Ms Gourian has previously told reporters she hopes to spend the rest of her life in the country.","Sofinar Gourian found guilty of wearing a dress made from Egyptian flag .

"The Irish student allegedly raped by a Wall St banker in the Hamptons told how she used 'every ounce of strength left inside me' to throw him off whilst he violently assaulted her. The 22-year-old said she kneed Jason Lee, an ex-Goldman Sachs managing director, in the groin during the struggle after he forced her onto the floor whilst naked in the bathroom of his $35,000 a month rented mansion. She sobbed and said she was left in a state of 'disbelief' and begged her friends to take her home - because she felt that it was her fault. The Irish student allegedly raped by Jason Lee, a Wall St banker in the Hamptons told how she used 'every ounce of strength left inside me' to throw him off whilst he violently assaulted her. Pictured: Lee walked hand in hand with his wife Alicia into New York Suffolk County Court on April 8 . The victim also revealed that she has not even told her family back in Ireland about her ordeal and made the 16 hour journey to New York to give evidence on her own, apparently lying to explain why she was in the US. The alleged rape happened in the summer of 2013 when the victim was in America for the summer on a J-1 exchange visa, which is commonly used by young Irish people visiting for a few months. Lee, 38, who is married, has denied first-degree rape, sexual misconduct and third-degree assault and faces up to 25 years in jail if convicted. The victim, who currently works in education, said that she had been working in South Carolina in a frozen yogurt shop for the summer of 2013 and had gone to New York to see this 'big city that everyone talks about'. She came to America to see the 'culture and the people' and when she was in the Hamptons was amazed at 'how cool it was'. Giving evidence the victim, who had her blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail and wore a black and white spotted dress, was visibly distressed and her hands were shaking. Former Goldman Sachs managing director Jason Lee, 38, faces charges of allegedly raping a 20-year-old Irish woman in the Hamptons in August 2013 . When asked to identify Lee she was unable to look him in the eye and welled up in tears. She described how she went to Montauk on Long Island to celebrate with her brother and met Lee and his friend Rene Duncan at the Georgica nightclub in Wainscott after taking a taxi there. The group partied until it closed around 3am, downing glasses of vodka and orange and went back to Lee's for an after party where they drank champagne from the bottle, swam in the pool and ate pizza, the court heard. Recounting the attack, she said that Lee barged into the downstairs bathroom wearing no clothes as she was changing to leave. Initially she was 'laughing' as she thought it was a joke - until Lee forced his way in. She said: 'I fell back and hit my hip and the back of my neck.' Suffolk County prosecutor Kerriann Kelly asked if she was on her back on the floor and the victim said yes. Miss Kelly asked: 'What happened?' The victim paused and struggled to get her words out as she said: 'Um, um, he was on top of me. He had his hands either side of my head'. She then stopped speaking and held up her hands either side of her head to show the court what she meant. The victim said: 'His arms were around my wrists. I struggled. At first I didn't really understand what was happening. I said get off and he didn't. ‘I just couldn't understand when you tell somebody to get off and they don't get off. I started calling my friend. He put his hand over my mouth with the back of his hand.' At Miss Kelly's asking, the victim held the back of her hand to her mouth to show what she meant. The victim said: 'I tried to bite him but I couldn't. He told me to shut the f*** up. He said it twice. He pulled up my dress and pulled down my underwear. I was still struggling, trying to get away.' Miss Kelly asked: 'What happened?' The victim again welled up and paused before saying: 'Um, that's when he, that's when he put his penis inside me'. Miss Kelly asked: 'Did you feel it?' The victim replied: 'Yes. He started going up and down.' Miss Kelly asked: 'We're you struggling?' The victim said: 'Yeah'. Miss Kelly asked: 'We're you crying?' The victim said: 'Yeah' The victim said: 'I used every ounce of strength left inside me to pull up my knee and hit him in the groin. ‘He fell off. I sat there in disbelief and couldn't believe what had happened. I took off the dress as quickly as I could because it was disgusting. I got out of there as quickly as I could.' Lee has denied first-degree rape, sexual misconduct and third-degree assault and could face 25 years in jail if convicted . Asked by Miss Kelly what her emotional state was, the victim said: 'I couldn't even speak. I know I was crying but I wasn't hysterical. I couldn't believe what had happened' The victim was led outside by her friends and told the first police officer on the scene that she had been raped, though she admitted that she did not want to involve the authorities. She said: 'I didn't want anything to do with the police. I just wanted to go home'. 'I felt like it was my fault. I shouldn't have got into the car (at Georgica). I should have gone home.' She described the examination by a nurse later that morning as 'so embarrassing'. She said: 'It was hard, so hard'. In her evidence the victim presented herself as a humble person and said that she thought that Georgica was 'too fancy for us'. The victim said: 'My friend and I thought it was funny that these two men were talking to us. We were just students and we didn't have much to offer. We were out of place'. Asked by Miss Kelly if she ever gave consent to have sex with Lee, the victim replied: 'No'. Miss Kelly asked: 'Did you tell him no?' The victim said: 'Yes'. Miss Kelly said: 'Did you tell him to get off of you?' The victim said: 'Yes’. Lee was a managing director for Goldman Sachs and works at the investment bank's headquarters at 200 West Street in Lower Manhattan. A representative from the company said he left the firm last year . In her evidence the victim also revealed that she had kept her ordeal a secret even from her own parents. Asked by Miss Kelly if she had told them, she said: 'No, nobody at home knows what happened'. The victim said that she had travelled to New York to give evidence on her own and that her brother had wanted to come with her 'so badly' but he couldn't. Under cross examination by Lee's lawyer Andrew Lankler, the victim was shown three photographs taken in Georgica. One showed her draped around Lee with two of her female friends either side of them. Another showed her between Lee and Mr Duncan. A third was a selfie the victim took and showed Lee with his arm around around her and his lips resting on her cheek. In all three she was smiling and appeared happy. She was also shown a picture of the bathroom where she claims she was raped and an image of the scratch on her leg that was caused during the struggle. The house on Clover Leaf Lane in East Hampton, New York, where the sexual assault allegedly occurred . The victim admitted to Mr Lankler that had it not been for her brother insisting she get in the police car, she probably never would have done so. She also said that the attack lasted no more than two minutes. Earlier the court heard from the victim’s best friend who also broke down in tears telling how she came upon her seconds after the assault. The woman said that the victim begged to be taken home as she emerged from a bathroom where Lee allegedly set upon her. The friend the court: 'She looked shaken. She looked scared. There was tears in her eyes. Her eyes were bloodshot.’ Lee was initially placed on leave from Goldman Sachs but last year left the company.

"Some teenagers get driving lessons from their parents. Other teens are taught by licensed instructors. But Malia Obama isn't your average 16-year-old: Her driving lessons were provided by the U.S. Secret Service.

"Bradley Dew has been jailed for mugging his deaf friend to steal his mobile phone and a £10 note . A thug has been jailed after he mugged his deaf friend to steal his mobile phone and a £10 note. Bradley Dew, 26, had been drinking with his friend at a pub in Faversham in Kent earlier that day and had borrowed his mobile. But later in the evening Dew returned to his friend's home, claiming he had lost the mobile on a train after returning from Herne Bay. As the friend said he was about to go out with his girlfriend, Dew pushed him back into a wall before striking him across the face. He then stole £10 out of his wallet. Dew, of Faversham, then fled the scene, and was found by police hiding in the toilets of a pub close to his friend's home hours later on March 29 last year. Officers said he was likely to have been left feeling vulnerable after being mugged in his own home. Dew denied stealing from his friend, and told officers it would have been 'like robbing my brother.' However he was found guilty of robbery and assault, following a trial held at Maidstone Crown Court. Detective Constable Kathryn Lumsden-Earle, of Kent Police, said: 'Dew took advantage of a so-called friend's generosity, taking his phone and then never returning it. 'He then acted like a bully by pushing and hitting his vulnerable victim before stealing money from his wallet. 'He did all of this in the victim's own home, which no doubt left him very frightened and scared for his safety. 'Time behind bars just might give him that opportunity to reflect on what he did that day, but more so the impact it had on someone he knew was vulnerable and who viewed him as a friend.'

"Tara and Gavin Hills, from Kanata, Canada, have been firmly in the anti-vaccination camp, that is until their seven children contracted whooping cough. At first, Mrs Hills thought her kids had a bad cold, but then she heard their deep, booming cough that made them gag and vomit - 'the kind of cough that stops a parent's heart,' she recalled to National Post. After looking up the symptoms online - powerful coughing fits, runny nose, stringy phlegm - the Hills took their ailing brood to the hospital on the morning of April 2. Scroll down for video . Change of heart: Tara and Gavin Hills, have been anti-vaxxers for six years, but all that changed when their seven young children came down with whooping cough . Public confession: Mrs Hills, pictured left and right with her husband, penned a blog post about her decision to ditch the anti-vaxxer stance . Large brood: The Hills' six sons and a daughter between the ages of 10 months and 10 years (pictured) remain in quarantine and are being treated with antibiotics . Four days later, lab tests confirmed whooping cough - an infection of the respiratory system characterized by severe coughing spells, which mainly affects infants and children between the ages of 11 and 18. According to KidsHealth.org, before a vaccine was developed, whooping cough - also known as pertussis - killed up to 10,000 people in the US annually. The introduction of the vaccine has reduced the number of fatalities caused by the infection each year to 30, but in recent years the number of cases has been on the rise. Tara Hills said she and her husband had their first three children partially vaccinated, but then stopped because they have grown suspicious of what she described on her blog, The ScientificParent.com, as the 'Big Pharma-Government-Media conspiracy.' Weary: Tara wrote that she and her husband decided to stop vaccinating their children because they didn't trust the health care system . At risk: The Hills' three eldest kids were partially vaccinated, but the four youngest ones got no shots at all, leaving them vulnerable . 'Were these vaccines even necessary in this day and age?' Mrs Hills wrote. 'Were we unwittingly doing greater harm than help to our beloved children? So much smoke must mean a fire so we defaulted to the ""do nothing and hope nothing bad happens"" position.' The Hills first began questioning their controversial anti-vaxxer stance after hearing of a massive measles outbreak at Disneyland earlier this year. At first, the parents' fear of contagion proved weaker than their mistrust of the medical system. But then Tara and her husband started looking at information from government agencies and reputable health organizations. In an ironic twist - one of many in the story of the Hills' evolution as anti-vaxxers - their children have been scheduled to get their first shots soon when whooping cough struck, reported CTV News. 'I looked again at the science and evidence for community immunity and found myself gripped with a very real sense of personal and social responsibility before God and man,’ Tara Hills wrote on her blog, adding that one of her main concerns was that her kids may have infected her sister's unvaccinated infant. The Hills' youngest children are still battling the illness, but are expected to recover . Her six sons and a daughter ranging in age from 10 months to 10 years have been ordered to remain in quarantine at their house in Kanata until they stop being contagious, which will take five days. On Thursday, Mrs Hills said her two eldest children have turned a corner and are now on the mend, while the younger kids are still battling the illness with the help of antibiotics. In her blog post titled Learning the Hard Way: My Journey from #AntiVaxx to Science, which has been viewed more than 2million times, Hills acknowledged the awkward position she has found herself in. 'I’m writing this from quarantine, the irony of which isn’t lost on me,' she wrote. 'I am not looking forward to any gloating or shame as this 'defection' from the antivaxx camp goes public, but this isn't a popularity contest. Right now my family is living the consequences of misinformation and fear.'","Tara and Gavin Hills, from Canada, stopped vaccinating their children six years ago after losing trust in the health care system .

"Kim Richards was arrested early Thursday morning after allegedly attacking a police officer. Law enforcement were called  to The Beverly Hills Hotel at approximately 1:30am where the 50-year-old reality star was hanging out at the Polo Lounge. Radar reports that at some point after midnight the mother-of-four was refused service by a bartender after she'd had a few too many vodka tonics. The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star then became very angry and reportedly shouted 'Don't you know who I am?' Scroll down for video . In jail: Kim Richards was arrested on Thursday morning after becoming belligerent while intoxicated at the Polo Lounge in The Beverly Hills Hotel . Kim - who has struggled with substance abuse in the past - then headed to a bathroom and refused to come out  - which was when cops were called. A source told the website: 'She eventually locked herself in a bathroom and was refusing to come out and causing a scene. Cops had to be called at that point.' According to Beverly Hills Police Department spokesman Lt. Lincoln Hoshino, Kim appeared 'belligerent with slurred speech and wreaking of a strong odor of alcohol.' Kim allegedly cursed at officers and 'passively resisted arrest,' Hoshino said. Where is went down: After drinking vodka tonics all night a bartender at The Polo Lounge refused to serve the former child star and she then became angry saying 'Don't you know who I am?' Taking a turn for the worse: After resisting arrest Kim - who apparently smelled strongly of booze - was eventually booked into a local jail where she kicked a police officer . TMZ reports the reality star had to be dragged out of the restrooms and taken to a nearby jail where she kicked a police officer. The reality star was issued a citation for trespass, resisting arrest, battery on a police officer and drunk in public and was later released on $20,000 bail at around 10:30am in the morning. She is due to appear at the Los Angeles Superior Court on May 10. Sources close to Kim's family tell People that they are heartbroken at the star's behaviour which has become more erratic in recent months. 'It will never get better. … She's been a mess, showing up late to events and social gatherings and acting bizarre or belligerent or both.' 'They of course love [Kim] and want to help, but no one can talk any sense into her because she is so out of it.' Really friends? Kim's supposed BFF Brandi Glanville took to her Twitter shortly after hearing the arrest news . Cast support: Kim's RHOBH cast mate Lisa Rinna tweeted her support despite questioning Kim's sobriety throughout the latest season . Empathy: Eileen Davidson also shared her reaction on Twitter shortly after news of Kim's arrest . The news may be unsurprising for some of her loved ones, however, as Us Weekly reported that she has been treating friends and family members terribly as a source said: 'Kim has been on the outs from her family recently. 'Things are so bad that nobody can deal with her. You can’t even talk to her for two seconds -- she turns horrible to everybody.' This type of reported behaviour is so alarming that some experts believe it would be best for Bravo to dismiss the television personality from the reality programme according to People. 'This is one of those moments when her painfully public problem can become a personally promising opportunity to turn her life around,' said William C. Moyers from the Hazelden Betty For Foundation, 'But only if she takes seriously the reality of what's happened, by stepping away from the limelight and instead putting her attention on the help she needs and deserves to get better.' 'There is nothing funny or appealing about the reality of Kim's situation,' the expert added. 'She owes it to herself to step away from the limelight to get help. Her costars and Bravo should encourage Kim to take the first step or next step to recover.' Her on-screen group: Kim's sobriety was a major plot point during the fifth season of the hit reality series (pictured at the reunion in February) All talk? In Tuesday night's finale reunion show Kim was adamant that she is not struggling with her sobriety . During an episode of RHOBH in January, Kim maintained 'I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs … I don't have anything to hide,' after being asked outright if she was still sober. On Tuesday's finale reunion episode of RHOBH, the former actress was defiant that everyone stop discussing her sobriety - insisting that when she popped a pill at Eileen's poker party it was a one-off under extraordinary circumstances. 'I took a pill for a chronic pain that I was having. Did I take somebody else's pill? Yes. Was that right? No.' Kim explained of taking a pill from ex-husband Monty, who has been battling cancer. Kim continued: 'Let's get this straight real quick - I am not struggling with my sobriety, nor have I struggled with my sobriety,' she said. After questioning where anyone had any real concern for her, she again insisted: 'I am sober. I have been sober for three years. I don't appreciate all the conversations that have been behind my back. And I do not have to defend myself any longer.' Defiant: Kim told her co-stars 'I am sober. I have been sober for three years and I do not have to defend myself any longer.' Family tension: The reality star also came to blows with her sister Kyle (pictured in red) during the hour-long show with Bravo's Andy Cohen . Co-star Lisa Rinna shot back 'Well Kim I'm just going to say - you showed up at my house and you were higher than a kite,' which further infuriated Kim who stressed that she had been open about that one occasion.' Kim's RHOBH cast mates expressed their reaction to their friend's arrest on their Twitter pages. 'I was sad to hear about Kim’s incident and I wish her and her family the best,' Rinna tweeted. 'I feel badly for Kim Richards and her family my thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time,' said Eileen Davidson. And BFF Brandi Glanville wrote: 'Wanted to say thank you to @KimRichards11 for donating to our school auction in the middle of all she has going on! so proud of her. 'Real friends are their in the good times,the bad times &especially the worst times.I am blessed with real friends & am a real friend myself.' Another one under her belt: Season five came to an end with part three of the reunion show which aired on Tuesday . Kim voluntarily entered rehab for alcohol addiction in December 2011  for the third time for and has been trying to stay sober ever since. In January 2012, Kim told Bravo's Andy Cohen in her first TV interview since her rehab stay: 'I'm an alcoholic. I had so much guilt and shame for my behavior... then I drank to cover the guilt and shame to make it go away.' In a separate sit down interview, Kim said, 'I'm getting reconnected with my kids, and that's been a huge thing for me. It's not what I expected when I came home. I was like, ""Hey! I'm home! Let's all get back exactly where we were!"" And they were like, ""Ummm, life is a little different now."" So it was like a little bit of a challenge when I got home, which I didn't expect.' She has four adult children, daughters Brooke Brinson, Whitney Davis and Kimberly Jackson, plus one son, Chad Davis. Her brood: Kim has four adult children, daughters Brooke Brinson, Whitney Davis and Kimberly Jackson and son Chad Davis . Famous: Here, Kim was in Different Strokes . Kim has now become most notable for her work on Bravo's Real Housewives franchise but her acting career began when she was six-years-old. The former child actor starred in numerous seventies TV programs including Nanny And The Professor and Little House On The Prairie. She also has a long resume of Disney films such as Escape to Witch Mountain, No Deposit, No Return and Return from Witch Mountain.

"A war of words appears to have erupted between two former rival stations who last week merged newsrooms. An account purporting to be Sydney radio station 2UE sent out a tweet on Thursday morning which appears to have come from a disgruntled former employee. 'Apologies for the s*** news service these days,' the tweet began. 'We hope you like the sound of whinging hyenas reading the news. #bringbackblanda', the post ended. What looks to a tweet from a disgruntled former radio employee emerged on Twitter on Thursday morning . The hashtag was in reference to the station's former newsreader Steve Blanda, who had read the news at 2UE for over a decade. While the tweet has since been removed from the @2UENews Twitter account, there is speculation online that it could have been sent by an employee displaced by the controversial merger. A 2UE spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that they were aware of the posting but denied the message came from one of their accounts. They said it had not been used in years, and they believe it had been hacked, but by who they said they were unsure. Last Thursday the 90-year-old radio station 2UE broadcast its last ever bulletin out of the Sydney office, following a merger with rival station 2GB. Jobs were lost out of the Brisbane 4BC office, and at Magic 1278 IS Brisbane. 2UE in Sydney has just merged with rival station 2GB, which meant job losses from the newsroom and additional redundancies nationally . A 2UE spokesman said the new combined newsroom will be staffed by more than 20 journalists from both stations. Reporter Robert Spicer filed a brief story about the history of the station, which has covered every major news story for the most part of the last century including former prime minister Gough Whitlam's dismissal, the Beaconsfield mine disaster and the recent Sydney siege. '2UE has covered every significant news event over the past 90 years, with some of the best journalists in the country,' he said. Jason Morrison, a former 2UE breakfast and drive broadcaster, said the station took a financial hit after letting controversial ratings winner Alan Jones defect to 2GB in 2002. '2UE made some terrible decisions - whoever could let Alan Jones leave 2UE?,' he told AAP. 'That was the death knell, really, for the station.' Instead of local presenters in Sydney and Brisbane Alan Jones' (right) show will be broadcast in the breakfast slot, while Ray Hadley (left) will present mornings - both from their 2GB programs . Morrison, who is now spokesman for billionaire mining magnate Gina Rinehart, said it is a shame the longstanding 2UE-2GB rivalry was now over. 'When there is competition, there will be that desire to ensure that no stone's left unturned and there will be that desire to make sure that all angles are covered.' The 2UE spokesman said redundancies from the creation of the single newsroom in Sydney were regrettable but the right commercial decision for the broadcaster. The merger also saw changes at the Brisbane 4BC station, with a number of high profile presenters being given the boot. 4BC presenters, including breakfast duo Ian Skippen and Loretta Ryan, mornings presenter Patrick Condren, evening presenter Walter Williams and weekend breakfast announcer Murray Shoring concluded their roles with the station on Friday. Instead Alan Jones' show will be broadcast in the breakfast slot, while Ray Hadley will present mornings - both from their 2GB programs, the ABC reported.","A tweet was sent from an account claiming to be linked to 2UE News .

"A nine-year-old girl who plummeted 30ft headfirst down the inside of a hollow tree claims she 'went to heaven and sat in Jesus's lap' while unconscious after the fall. Her mother, Christy Wilson Beam, 42, has spoken of her amazement after  Annabel, now 12, escaped the horrifying accident unscathed - even waking miraculously cured of a devastating illness that had plagued her childhood. For the first time in her life, she can eat solid food – and her mother thinks her brush with Jesus is the reason why. Scroll down for video . Annabel Beam, now 12, believes she visited Heaven when unconscious after falling 30ft at the age of nine . Annabel (centre), with her mother Christy and father Kevin and her sisters Abigail (right) and Adelynn (left) In December, 2011, Annabel was playing outside the family's Texas home with her sisters Abigail, now 14 and Adelynn, now ten, when she slipped and fell inside a hollowed-out cottonwood tree. Mum Christy said: 'She hit her head three times on the way down and this is consistent with the findings of an MRI scan. 'With the facts in front of me now, I see it all with sickening clarity. 'Sometimes at night, it replays in my head – a dark twist on Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole.' An emergency fire crew managed to harness Annabel to safety and she was rushed to Cook Children's Hospital in Fort Worth in a helicopter. Fearing the worst, medics prepped brain and spinal injury teams to stand by for Annabel's arrival – but, incredibly, she survived without a scratch. Video: Today . Annabel survived the horrific fall with only bumps and bruises. The doctors said 'I guess someone up there was looking out for her' Annabel's mother, Christy, and father, Kevin, believe their daughter, saying she 'has no interest in melodrama' Doctors told her relieved parents: 'I guess someone up there was looking out for her.' 'The ER doc told us the one thing we weren't expecting to hear,' her mother said. 'He said, ""Other than a possibly concussion and some superficial bumps and bruises, she doesn't appear to have been injured at all."" '[My husband] Kevin and I exchanged a look of pure astonishment.' In the days following the accident, Annabel began to talk of religious visions she experienced while lying unconscious. She told her parents: 'I went to heaven when I was in that tree. I sat in Jesus' lap.' 'I saw in Anna's eyes the conscious decision to confide in us,' Christy said. 'There was no drama, she wasn't playing either. 'This wasn't like one of her long, spun-out recaps of a funny dream or movie she'd seen. 'She'd been through enough real drama in her short life. She had no interest in melodrama. '[She described] some of what she'd experienced while inside the tree – how the gates of Heaven are made of gold, how Jesus told her it wasn't time.' A cross marks the hollowed-out cottonwood tree, where Annabel plummeted 30ft headfirst to the bottom . Initially, Christy was concerned that Annabel was indicating a head injury, but MRI and CT scans revealed she had not sustained one. Further tests also revealed Annabel had remarkably stopped displaying symptoms of pseudo-obstruction motility disorder, a rare incurable condition that had seen her in and out of hospital since 2008. Doctors advised she could begin to come off the antibiotics she had been taking for years. Instead of taking ten different types of medication throughout the day, she only needed three, and the painkillers that were prescribed 'as and when she needed them' were not required at all. Previously, Annabel's medication meant she had to have a liquid diet or stick to soft, bland food – but now, she can happily tuck into pizzas and McDonald's happy meals. The family have gone more than a year without a single visit to the doctor. 'I can't explain what happened to her physically while she was in that tree,' said her father Kevin. 'All I have to go on is the radiological data and the medical records from before and after. 'The proof is in the pudding. She wasn't well before and now she is. 'All I know beyond that is that she believes she went to Heaven. And I believe her when she tells me she believes it.' Nine-year-old Annabel was playing outside with her sisters Abigail and Adelynn when she fell inside the tree . Annabel said she saw a fairy-like guardian angel as she gained consciousness, and it stayed with her while she was rescued, shining a light so she could see . Annabel talked of seeing a 'guardian angel' as she came to. The schoolgirl said: 'I started to wake up in the tree and I could hear the firemen's voices. And I saw an angel that looked very small, like a fairy. 'And the God winked at me through the body of the angel and what He was saying to me was, 'I'm going to leave you now and everything is going to be okay. 'And then the angel stayed with me the entire time, shining a light so I could see. We didn't talk. We just sat together peacefully.' She also spoke of seeing Mimi, her great-grandmother who'd died in 2010 after surgery on a blocked intestine. When asked what Jesus looked like, Annabel said: 'He had a beautiful long white robe, dark skin and a big beard – kinda like Santa Claus, but not really.'","Nine-year-old 'saw Heaven and sat in Jesus's lap' while unconscious .

The 10 centres, all of which have either closed or changed their use since the time of the alleged abuse, also includes Whatton Youth Detention Centre. Also being investigated are three former residential centres in Mansfield and five others in Worksop, Southwell and Stapleford. The inquiry will have a team of 20 people looking into the abuse claims and will also include two social workers. Three of the 23 allegations relate to a former youth detention centre, where teenage inmates were detained with the oldest claim dating back to the 1940s. Police will look at whether the abuse was systematic or organised. However, they say they are aware many of the records relating to the homes may no longer exist and that some of the alleged perpetrators may have died.

"George Galloway has accused the Labour candidate running against him in the Bradford West constituency of lying about being forced to marry when she was 15 years old. Naz Shah, a mother-of-three from Bradford, has previously claimed that she was coerced into marrying her cousin in Pakistan before being sexually and physically abused. However, Mr Galloway's Respect Party now claims to have obtained a copy of her 'nikah', or marriage certificate, showing that she actually married when she was 16 and a half in 1990. Naz Shah, the Labor party candidate standing against George Galloway in Bradford West, has previously told how she was forced into marriage age 15 - but Mr Galloway's party claims to have evidence this is untrue . At a hustings on Wednesday night (pictured) Mr Galloway produced a nikah, or Pakistani marriage certificate, which he claims shows that Ms Shah was in fact married in 1990, when she was 16 and a half . At a hustings in Bradford on Wednesday night, Mr Galloway, who is defending a 10,000-vote majority, produced the document, saying Ms Shah has 'only a passing acquaintance with the truth.' To applause, he also accused her of playing into negative stereotypes about Pakistan, and accused her of slandering the British Pakistani community. But Ms Shah has now hit back, saying there are two copies of her Nikah. One dated 1990, which Mr Galloway has, and another earlier version dated 1988, which has been supplied to MailOnline. A spokesman for the Labour Party said that Ms Shah was forced into marriage aged 15, but that her husband wanted to come to the UK on a spouse visa. Because the British authorities do not recognise marriages to people under the age of 16, a second document was drawn up and dated 1990. They say this is the document Mr Galloway's party has. A Labour spokesman said: 'George Galloway is an absentee MP who has failed to stand up for, and has nothing positive to offer to, the people of Bradford West. 'He is instead resorting to desperate untruths about Labour’s candidate. We have written to him to warn him that we believe his conduct to be a breach of election law. 'While George Galloway spends his time seeking to divide our community, Naz Shah and Labour will continue to show people that she will be a strong voice for Bradford West.' Labour also accused Mr Galloway of obtaining the nikah by sending a man to the registry office in Mirpur posing as Ms Shah's father, who died several years ago. A Respect Party spokesman responded, saying the allegations were 'totally and utterly untrue', insisting that their contact had simply requested the certificate and paid a five rupee sum before it was handed over. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'We were given a copy of the nikah by a close family member in this country so we decided to check whether this was genuine. However, Labour have said there are two copies of the nikah, the original being dated in 1988, when Ms Shah would have been 15, which they are in possession of. They say the second was drawn up when Ms Shah's husband tried to get a spouse visa to the UK, where marriages to those under 16 are not recognised . The Labour party said they have been in touch with the election watchdog about Mr Galloway's comments, claiming they breach guidelines and warning him not to repeat them . 'We got a third party to go to the registry office in Mirpur, where he retrieved the original nikah showing the marriage was in 1990. 'There was no subterfuge, he paid five rupees and he was given the certificate.' Speaking to the Guardian, the party said the nikah dated 1990 revealed that Ms Shah's mother and family members attended, claiming that this shows the ceremony was not forced. On the subject of a second nikah dated 1988, he said the party was waiting for it to be produced so it could be independently verified. The spokesman also claimed that it was not possible for two copies of the nikah to exist without the couple first being divorced, and said Labour had yet to produce proof of a separation. The Labour party told MailOnline that they had already given the document, which is written in urdu, to three independent translators who had all confirmed it was genuine. Labour also said the party had complained to the election watchdog about Mr Galloway's behaviour, saying he had made false statements about Ms Shah, and warned for him not to repeat them. Ms Shah first went public with the story of her childhood early last month, just days after being selected as Labour's candidate in Bradford West. In an open letter, she described growing up in Bradford in extreme poverty and becoming homeless aged six after her father left his family destitute when he eloped with a 16-year-old neighbour. She said was forced to be a parent to her two sisters after her mother, who had suffered years of abuse at the hands of a local drug dealer, was jailed for his murder after she poisoned him. She said she became a political campaigner while fighting for her mother's release from prison, which came in 2000 after 14 years behind bars. After Ms Shah's mother was jailed she became estranged from the rest of the family, but travelled to Pakistan in the late 80s to see them. It was then that she claims she was forced into marrying her cousin, saying she only agreed after being coerced by other family members. According to her account, she escaped that relationship in 1992 before going back to college in Britain.","Naz Shah claimed to have been forced into abusive marriage aged 15 .

"Realtors in Indianapolis are looking to unload what's likely the Midwestern city's gaudiest and most famous home--a 26,000-square-foot castle built of ranch homes glued together by a former pimp turned construction king. For a meager $862,000, its gargoyles, endless balconies and ornate fountains can be yours with which to carry on the eccentric torch of quirky Indy celebrity Jerry A. Hostetler. It sprang from inimitable Hostetler's imagination after he went from 24-year-old pimp known to police as Mr. Big to a local mini-magnate. Now, as it sits largely unoccupied, it's a cause for both concern and awe as neighbors wonder how something so immensely unique and bound to its creator can remain among the neighborhood's modest ranchers and middle class homes. Scroll down for video . Went big: Realtors in Indianapolis are looking to unload what's likely the Midwestern city's gaudiest and most famous home--a 26,000 square foot castle built of ranch homes glued together by a former pimp turned construction king . Uncertain future: Hostetler realized his vision, but after he died in 2006 the home became a spectacle when no longer attached to its creator . Currently trying to sell off the home is Indiana-born, Florida-based tech investor Chad Folkening, reports the Indy Star. He purchased the home in foreclosure following Hostetler's 2006 death. He listed it for $2.2 million in February 2012. By December 2013, that number had dropped to $1,295,000. Last week, the asking price dropped to $862,000. But the home's newest listing agent is keeping an upbeat attitude. 'I showed it to two serious buyers last week,' agent Tiff Atkinson told the Star. 'One cannot even begin to describe,' continued Atkinson. 'Lots of architectural design, very private, two or three parking garages.' Started small: Jerry A. Hostetler was once a 24-year-old pimp known to Indianapolis police as Mr. Big. After becoming a local construction mini-mogul, he started buying up the homes around his modest 3-bedroom ranch house . Inventive: The house is actually five garden-variety ranch houses cobbled together to form a 20,000-plus square foot campus-o-fun complete with swimming pool, ballroom and guesthouse . Atkinson and Folkening have envisioned a sort of live-and-work tech startup campus as one use for the home. Atkinson, who works for Carpenter Realtors, sees the perfect home for 'formal and informal gatherings, from small crowds to hundreds of guests.' Starting from a three-bedroom ranch house where he lived since the '60s for a short time with a wife and infant daughter, Hostetler gradually bought up his neighbors' houses. Hostetler, on the other hand, saw a blank canvas on which to splatter his haphazard domestic vision. Steadily grew: He cobbled them together, dug a swimming pool, dug ponds, imported fountains, added ballrooms, added life-size statues of gorillas, added -- of all things -- a stone grotto (into which he installed a hot tub) Spacious: When the banks finally caught up with Hostetler, who'd long ago stopped paying his debts, his sprawling home had grown to 23,000 square feet . The house is actually five garden-variety ranch houses cobbled together to form a 20,000-plus square foot campus-o-fun complete with swimming pool, ballroom and guesthouse. He cobbled them together, dug a swimming pool, dug ponds, imported fountains, added ballrooms, added life-size statues of gorillas, added -- of all things -- a stone grotto (into which he installed a hot tub). Since Hostetler's death in 2006, the house has remained empty, with some of its more outlandish accoutrements - such as a 6-foot mermaid and polar bear statue - sold off. He was 66. In constrast to how he lived, he now rests quite modestly. He was buried in Washington Park East Cemetery, in an unmarked grave. Gaudy: Since Hostetler's death in 2006, the house has remained empty, with some of its more outlandish accoutrements - such as a 6-foot mermaid and polar bear statue - sold off .

"You'd think that being a chef, I'd want to escape the toils of the kitchen while on holiday - but the opposite is true. I jump at the chance to experience new flavours and gather fresh inspiration. And where better to tickle your tastebuds than in glorious Grenada? The island is known for its zesty spices and self-sufficiency - the only food it imports is milk. Heading west: Rosemary spent a week on Grenada, where fresh foodstuffs like cocoa fruit are easily available . Meat and fish are plentiful and, because the soil is very fertile, the vegetables, fruit and salads are the glossiest you'll ever see. Grenada's seasons are similar to our own, which means cauliflower, broccoli and pumpkins in spring. Exotic fruit - mangoes, star fruit, passion fruit, melon and skin-up, which is like a lychee — are the stars of the summer. Autumn heralds guavas, sweetsop (sugar apples) and soursop (similar to pawpaw), and then there is the temptingly named mammee apple, which is a Caribbean version of a peach. Sumptuous sands: Grenada is home to splendid beaches - such as the glorious arc of Grand Anse . I am staying in the southwest of the island at Mount Cinnamon on Grand Anse Beach, near the charming town of St George. It offers well-equipped self-catering villas, each with its own terrace and wonderful views of the bay. You can cook your own supper, but the bubbling restaurant scene is difficult to resist. Beach bars abound. I especially liked the Beach Cabana at Mount Cinnamon, where they serve fabulously strong cocktails made with local rum at all hours of the day and night. People come across from nearby islands to enjoy the weekly bonfire on the beach, at which local musicians play. This is the Caribbean at its best. Just beware of those generous drinks measures. The restaurant Yolo (which is text speakfor 'you only live once') specialises in sushi and Asian cuisine. I order plums, mangoes, cherries and avocados, all picked that day. The fish is as fresh as can be - so the tuna tartare, its signature dish, almost leaps off the plate. Come dine with me: Grenada is an island awash with fresh produce and intriguing local recipes . The next day, I watch a fish cookery demonstration at Mount Cinnamon: a traditional dish of kingfish marinated in coconut, ginger, lime, spices, peppers and chives, wrapped in banana leaves and cooked over a wood fire, and served with delicious breadfruit chips. If you want to mingle with Grenadans, there is nowhere better than a rambunctious food market. St George's market brims with local spices and everything else that is grown on the island. In a 17th-century working plantation - a colonial house and estate - you can witness the crops of fruit, exotic flowers and spices in their regimented glory. Here, I learn to cook the Grenadan national dish, oil down. This is a hearty, one-pot meal with salted meat, chicken, breadfruit, callaloo - which is like spinach - and dumplings. The whole lot is stewed in coconut milk. Delicious! The food odyssey continues in the evening when I visit BB's Crabback Caribbean restaurant, overlooking the harbour. My favourite place to eat on the beach is La Sagesse, on its own strip of sand from which you can swim in a bath-temperature sea. A place to cool your heels: Rosemary stayed at Grenada's elegant Mount Cinnamon resort . No tour of the island would be complete without a visit to the River Antione Rum Distillery - the last one in the Caribbean to make the drink from cane sugar, as they did in the 18th century. Rum is not to my taste, but it's interesting to see the process behind it. Belmont in the Grand Etang area is more to my liking. It's a fully functioning plantation and organic farm. We taste goat's cheese and salt fish fritters, a popular local dish. Even the governor grows her own vegetables. Her Excellency Dame Cecile la Grenade is the first woman governor on the island. She received an OBE from the Queen for the food business started by her mother. Her extensive gardens are full of exotic vegetables, fruit and spices — a dream to any aspiring cook. Even the paths are made of crushed nutmeg shells. A fitting tribute to this fragrant and friendly island. British Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com) flies to Grenada from £562 return.

"A father from Milton Keynes claims he has developed an allergy to Nigel Farage that leaves him sweating and shaking whenever he sees the Ukip leader on TV. Richard Howarth, 35, says he gets so agitated when he sees Mr Farage that he has to immediately change the channel or he becomes ill. The medical recruitment consultant, who has always had a keen interest in politics, said hearing Mr Farage's voice makes him 'physically sick'. Scroll down for video . Richard Howarth says he breaks out in a sweat and starts shaking when he sees Ukip leader Nigel Farage . He claims the lead up to the election is a difficult time for him because Mr Farage, who is standing as a candidate in Thanet South and has appeared on TV debates, is on television so often. He said: 'It's almost like an allergy. The symptoms are similar. When I see him on telly, I sweat a lot and become anxious. 'Thinking about how the party can affect the way my son is going to be able to live his life in the UK makes me worry. 'I end up switching over because he just infuriates me. I'm obviously allergic to Nigel Farage.' Mr Howarth said he initially watched coverage of Mr Farage to educate himself on Ukip's policies. 'At the start, I did listen to his points but in the end I couldn't,' he said. 'It was not good for my health. 'Seeing him made me weak – I had to lie down. I can't watch him anymore. I don't want to feel ill and anxious.' Mr Howarth, 35, says he has to change the channel when Mr Farage appears or he becomes physically sick . A phobia expert says it's possible to have a reaction to a politician or person you fundamentally disagree with . Changing the channel usually provides instant relief, but sometimes Mr Howarth gets so frustrated thinking about Mr Farage that it takes him hours to calm down. 'If I do something else and distract myself away from it, I'm fine but otherwise it can be a couple of hours,' he said. Mr Howarth's wife Catherine, 32, has also told of his reaction. 'He has to turn the TV off or change channels because both seeing and hearing Nigel's voice makes him physically sick,' she admitted, saying she had sympathy for her husband's unusual symptoms. 'He gets anxious and irritable and his hands shake. When he does turn over his symptoms continue for a while.' Psychologist Dr Rick Norris, author of Think Yourself Happy, said Mr Howarth's reactions sound more like they are the result of a phobia rather than allergy. Mr Howarth's wife Catherine (right) says her husband gets so wound up by Mr Farage that he starts to shake . Dr Norris said: 'Phobias are irrational fears that cause some kind of avoidance reaction in the people who experience them. 'It is possible to have such a reaction to a politician or person whose views are diametrically opposed to your own. 'Some people can have similar reaction to their boss. They can get very fearful when called into their bosses' office or at the thought of seeing them. 'What's unusual in this case is that Mr Howarth appears not to have been in Mr Farage's presence, only to have seen him on the television.'","Father from Milton Keynes says he has a physical reaction to the politician .

"A Liberal mayor who wrote a glowing reference for a convicted rapist asking for him to be spared jail is developing a program to teach young women about 'risky behaviour'. Eastern Sydney's Waverley mayor Sally Betts wrote a reference for Luke Lazarus 'out of loyalty to the family' after he raped an 18-year-old woman in an alleyway outside his father's SOHO nightclub, in Sydney. Now the controversial councillor is developing 'a new risky behaviour education program to try and help young women understand and better deal with being in vulnerable situations'. In an interview with the Wentworth Courier she referenced the behaviour of Lazarus's victim. The Mayor of three years said: 'By the sheer fact of (the assault) happening at a nightclub and alcohol is involved, (means people are) open to the possibility of risky behaviour, so I'm saying let's try and close that loophole.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Cr Betts for comment. Waverley mayor Sally Betts wrote a reference for convicted rapist Luke Lazarus and is now developing 'a new risky behaviour education program' for young women . Cr Betts is reportedly developing the program for school girls alongside Waverley Action for Youth Services (WAYS) and the police. Lazarus, a 23-year-old former private school boy, was jailed for at least three years on March 27 after he raped the teenage virgin in an alleyway. During Lazarus's trial, the jury was told that he boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at his father's club, the SOHO, before he ushered her into the alleyway. The court heard that during the assault he pulled her stockings down, ignored a second request by her to leave and said in an authoritative tone 'put your f***ing hands on the wall, get on the floor and arch your back'. When it was over Lazarus told her to add her name to a list of conquests in his phone that he had. In a text message to a friend the afternoon after the attack, in the early hours of May 12, 2013, Lazarus said: 'I honestly have zero recollection of calling you ... Was a sick night – took a chick's virginity.' During Luke Lazarus's rape trial, the jury were told he boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at the SOHO, before he ushered her into an alleyway . Luke Lazarus was sentenced on March 27 for raping an 18-year-old at his father's SOHO nightclub on May 12, 2013 . His friend replied: 'bahahahaha nice popping does cherries ... ' Lazarus replied: '... it's a pretty gross story tell ya later'. In sentencing him, Judge Sarah Huggett found the offence was not premeditated but said he was reckless. 'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he must have realised there was a possibility she wasn't consenting,' she told Sydney's District Court. But she said he was 'not caring in one way or another whether she was consenting'. Sally Betts has been the Mayor of Waverley for three years in Sydney's eastern suburbs . Cr Betts said in the character reference she wrote for Lazarus that his conviction was 'inconsistent with the gentle well-mannered and respectful young man that I know'. She also said she had no hesitation supporting Lazarus and his family. In a recent interview with the Wentworth Courier she said she wrote the reference in support of Lazarus's grandparents whom she has been friends with for 30 years. 'They are shocked and devastated and I wrote in support of them,' she said. Australia's first Minister for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Pru Goward slammed the public figures in the local community who supported Lazarus. Along with Cr Betts, the honorary secretary of the Honorary Consulate-General of Greece in Brisbane, Tsambico K Athanasas, South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league club chairman Nick Pappas and the parish priest at the Greek Orthodox Christian Church of St George, Rose Bay, Father Gerasimos Koutsouras, spoke out to support him. 'Not only does this diminish their standing, it can shatter the confidence of the victim and often discourages them from seeking justice,' she said. On Thursday, Federal Member for Wentworth and Minister for Communications Malcolm Turnbull, whose electorate takes in Betts' council area, refused to endorse her to continue in her position. Turnbull's office declined to respond when probed by the Guardian over whether he would support her as mayor. A council investigation is currently underway to determine whether she broke the code of conduct. On Facebook a campaign page with over 200 likes has begun calling for her removal from office. 'As a community we must stand against our elected leaders supporting convicted rapists. Sally Betts Mayor of Waverley needs to know that she must go,' the page says. Last week, nightclub promoters apologised after a photo of a young woman sprawled out on a tiled-floor was used to advertise their Easter weekend event - just a week after Lazarus was convicted of raping a teenage girl at the venue. A photo of a 'drunken' young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub's Facebook page on April 3. The photo's caption said: 'We're throwing an extra special Yeezter event Tonight. Free entry till 10pm and $5 drinks till midnight – get amongst it!' Luke Lazarus will spend a minimum of three years behind bars. He told the court that attending his father's clubs gave him an 'inflated sense of power and entitlement' A photo of a drunken looking young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub's Facebook page on April 3 by an 'external promoter' The disturbing image was soon removed by the club's management after a backlash on Twitter, the Daily Life reports, with one shocked social media user complaining: 'This is how Luke Lazarus (sic) father promotes nightclub SOHO. Posted week after sentencing!'. A Twitter user told Daily Mail Australia : 'Once it did Twitter rounds and people started commenting it was removed by Saturday.' A SOHO management spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'The event on the night was set up by an external promoter as a one-off event. 'He was given access to the official Facebook page but as soon as we noticed he'd put that up it was taken down.' The club agreed that the photo used was '100 per cent inappropriate'. The SOHO nightclub is a popular venue in Sydney's Kings Cross district . Judge Huggett said Lazarus, a South Sydney Rabbitohs fan, came from a privileged upbringing .","Luke Lazarus was convicted of raping an 18-year-old at SOHO nightclub .

"Up to 100 Islamic teachers could be banned from working in schools for life following an investigation into their alleged links to the Trojan Horse scandal. It is understood a teaching watchdog is working on possible disciplinary cases against current and former staff members at some schools in Birmingham where extremist Islamic views were being forced on pupils and staff. This includes allegations an al-Qaeda style video featuring masked gunmen was copied in a classroom and teachers punished pupils by making them kneel on tiles. More than 50 teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged as many as 3,000 messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby was a hoax. Scroll down for video . Park View School in Birmingham was one of the schools placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism - up to 100 teachers are now being investigated . It is understood the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) - the profession's watchdog responsible for banning teachers from classrooms - is looking at 30 disciplinary cases, with an expectation many more teachers will be targeted for their part in the affair. The probe into the Islamic plot last year found evidence of anti-Western rhetoric, intolerance towards gays and creating the perception of a worldwide conspiracy against Muslims. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Allegations under investigation include claims that an al-Qaeda style video was copied at Park View Academy and teachers punished children by making them kneel on the floor, the Sunday Times reports. A group of teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group where they claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby and the Boston bombings, where two bombs were set off at the finish line of the city's marathon, were a hoax. Professional hearings are set to begin next month. More than 50 teachers alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich,  was a hoax . In his report, Peter Clarke (pictured) found there had been a 'coordinated, deliberate and sustained action' to introduce an aggressive Islamic ethos in the schools . The teaching watchdog has obtained 'dossiers' about some of the 100 staff it is investigating from the Department for Education as part of its inquiries. They are understood to include information from last year's Trojan Horse probe headed by Peter Clarke, the former head of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard. His report, published in July, found there had been a 'co-ordinated, deliberate and sustained action, carried out by a number of associated individuals, to introduce an intolerant and aggressive Islamic ethos into a few schools in Birmingham'. It also highlighted a 'disconcerting pattern' in the schools, including nepotism in staff appointments, bullying of senior teachers, a 'strategy of harassment to oust the head teacher' and the 'reinforcement of Muslim identity to the exclusion or disparagement of others'. A source told the Sunday Times: 'The 100 or so include teachers, teaching assistants and teaching staff. The Department for Education is feeding in information to help corroborate some of what the NCTL has, and, in other cases, flag up new targets.' 'In some cases, some of those teachers and staff are still working at schools, and in other cases they have been removed. 'But although some of them have been removed, the NCTL does not want them to end up anywhere else.' The Trojan Horse scandal started with an anonymous letter in March last year describing an Islamic plot to take over schools in Birmingham called 'Operation Trojan Horse'. The document - now thought to be a hoax - proposed a campaign of installing governors and undermining and then replacing school leaders with staff who would be more sympathetic to their religious agenda. That in turn led to 21 schools being inspected by schools inspector Ofsted, which put six schools in special measures and said five had not done enough to protect children from extremism. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Then in November last year, inspectors found evidence that six independent faith schools in Tower Hamlets, in east London, had an unbalanced curriculum. Several teenage girls have fled to join ISIS in Syria from schools in Tower Hamlets. This Easter, tens of thousands of leaflets were distributed by Tower Hamlets council advising parents to 'lock away' their children's passports if they fear the youngsters may be planning to travel to Syria over the holiday period. Tower Hamlets is the only local authority in London where Muslims account for the largest single religious group. An estimated 35 per cent of the population practise Islam, compared with 4.4 per cent across the country according to the latest census.","Teaching watchdog investigating some 100 staff with links to the scandal .

"Dover police say a man they believe to be the so-called 'rat burglar' who cut holes to tunnel into buildings has been arrested in Maryland. Authorities said in a news release Thursday that 49-year-old Thomas K. Jenkins of Capitol Heights, Maryland, was arrested last month by deputies with the Prince George's County Sheriff's Office. 'Rat burglar': Thomas K. Jenkins, pictured is accused of robbing 18 Dover businesses . From September 2014 to February 2015, Jenkins allegedly carried out 18 commercial robberies in Dover, Delaware, authorities there said. 'During the investigation it was learned that the Prince George’s County Sheriff’s Department had a series of burglaries that were similar in nature to the eighteen committed in Dover,' the release said. Thomas Jenkins has been accused by the Dover Police Department of robbing multiple businesses. They are: . Maple Dale Country Club . Manlove Auto Parts . Sovereign Properties . Morgan Properties . U and I Builders . AMCO Check Cashing . Colonial Investment . 1st Capital Mortgage . Advantage Travel . Ancient Way Massage . Tranquil Spirit Massage/Spa . Christopher  Asay Massage . Morgan Communities . Vincenzo's Restaurant . Happy Fortune Chinese Restaurant . Happy 13 Liquors . Del-One Credit Union . Pizza Time . Melvin's Auto Service . Source: Dover Police Department/The News Journal . A car was found behind a building where a robbery took place and led  deputies in Maryland to consider Jenkins as a suspect, authorities said. Law enforcement later found Jenkin's car and tracked where he went, Dover police said. Police say Jenkins had cut a hole in the roof of a commercial business in Maryland on March 9 and deputies arrested him as he fled. According to Dover police, 'Jenkins was found in possession of .45-caliber handgun that was stolen from a business in Delaware State Police Troop 9 jurisdiction. A search of Jenkins vehicle revealed an additional .45-caliber handgun stolen from the same business.' Jenkins is being held in Maryland and will face 72 charges involving the 18 burglaries in Dover when he is returned to Delaware. The charges he is facing break down to: four counts of wearing a disguise during the commission of a felony, eighteen counts of third-degree burglary, eighteen counts of possession of burglary tools, fourteen counts of theft under $1,500, and eighteen counts of criminal mischief, two of which are felonies, authorities said. Cpl. Mark Hoffman with the Dover Police Department told the News Journal that Delaware State Police are planning to file charges over a 19th robbery at Melvin's Auto Service, which reportedly occurred in a part of Dover where jurisdiction is held by state police. Sharon Hutchison, who works at one of the businesses Jenkins allegedly robbed, told the newspaper 'He cut through two layers of drywall, studs and insulation.' The Prince George's County Sheriff's Department did not immediately return a request for information on what charges Jenkins is facing there.","Thomas K.

"Maate, it's the biggest bogan in Straya! This is the image of the Big Bogan statue that the Bogan Shire Council is aiming to erect in the town of Nyngan to honour the Aussie icon - and hopefully draw in the crowds. The man behind it all is Graeme Burke who is the manager of engineering services for the council and this is his design for the statue. This is how Graeme Burke envisages the 'Big Bogan' statue will look like . Pass us a smoke mate: The term 'bogan' has a number of negative connotations for Australians but has become a character part of popular folklore, being depicted here by actor Eric Bana . Mr Burke said the 3.6-metre statue would show a 'bloke' wearing shorts, thongs and a singlet with a fishing rod and a tuckerbox. Locals and visitors would also be able to sit on it and take photographs. 'Graham McCleod of the Anglican Church suggestion to me some time ago that Nyngan would benefit froma “Big Bogan” sculpture as a tourist attraction so I have been considering various designs for its construction,' Mr Burke told Daily Mail Australia. 'Although I do not like the way a 'bogan' is depicted and I do not want Nyngan to be thought of as being a town full of “bogans”, it is a term that is widely used and well known in Australia and New Zealand. 'Where better in Australia could we have “The Big Bogan” than on the banks of the Bogan River, in Bogan Shire?' Bogan Shire Council, in western New South Wales, wants to erect a 'big bogan' statue . The 'big bogan' statue could prove as popular as the Big Banana which is a tourist attraction in Coffs Harbour . Mr Burke's proposal is for a 3.6m tall steel figure cut out of 5mm steel plate. The figure is wearing a singlet, has a handlebar moustache and is holding a fishing rod. The esky in the original drawing would be constructed as a three dimensional steel box fixed to the sculpture to allow tourists to sit on to have their photo taken. 'I would like the sculpture to be related to Nyngan on the Bogan River, I have used the fishing theme and I would like to see it located on the eastern side of the Peter Sinclair Bridge opposite the Tritton Mine Village,' Mr Bourke said. 'In this location it would be on the highway, at the river, and visible from both directions.' The traditional bogan image has include a 'mullett' style haircut, singlet and thongs, and beer . Could the 'big bogan' rival this?  Nicknamed 'Rambo', The Big Merino is a 15.2 metres tall concrete merino ram, located in Goulburn, New South Wales . The Big Prawn in Ballina has become famous in the region . He estimated the construction and installation of the 'Big Bogan' would be a total cost of $8,000. The 'big bogan' statue could prove as popular as the Big Banana which is a tourist attraction in Coffs Harbour, the The Big Merino in Goulburn, the Big Prawn in Ballina and Sunshine Coast's Big Pineapple. However, Bogan Shire Council said the venture would not go ahead until the community gave it the thumbs up. ABC News reports that local residents have expressed mixed feelings about it already. In the Sunshine Coast, the Big Pineapple is a major feature . One said it was a great idea - but it could be improved. 'One thing that's missing is the stubby,' he said. Another resident was less enthusiastic. 'I do not identify as a bogan - if you look up bogan, it's very negative,' she said.","Bogan Shire Council in NSW is planning a statue to honour its namesake .

"It's not just UV rays that suncreams now protect against - some new products claim to stop the damage from infra-red A rays, too. Meanwhile others say they protect the skin from the inside. But are any of these high-tech suncreams worth buying? Here, Dr Bav Shergill, a consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, offers his verdict. And we rate them... A new generation of suncreams promise to protect against the damage from infra-red A rays and others say they protect the skin from the inside. Here, consultant dermatologist Bav Shergill gives his verdict . Dr Skin's Suncare Lotion And Sun Drink . £11.90 for five 60ml shots and 100ml lotion, dr-skins.com . CLAIMS: SPF 30 suncream containing UVA and UVB protection, plus pack of five 60ml liquid food supplement shots - these contain vitamin E, lycopene, vitamin C, beta-carotene and other nutrients for skin health. EXPERT VERDICT: 'A bit of a gimmick - the concept is you are protecting the skin from the inside out with antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables. 'There's no evidence that drinking this would stop sun damage. 'The suncream is ok, but it's pretty standard.' 5/10 . Ladival Sun Protection, SPF 30 . £19.99 for 150ml spray, from Boots and supermarkets . CLAIMS: First mainstream product to protect against infra-red A rays as well as UVA and UVB. Also has antioxidants. Offers 'protection against four times more of the sun's rays'. EXPERT VERDICT: 'The effects of infra-red A rays on the skin is an emerging field of research. 'A recent study suggests antioxidants may stop damage from infra-red A. 'I'd plump for Factor 50 rather than Factor 30 - although some argue this only improves protection by 3 per cent. 'You can get the same UVA and UVB protection from cheaper products.' 6/10 . Dr Skin's lotion and sun drink comes with liquid food supplement shots, while Ladival is the first product to protect against infra-red A rays as well as UVA and UVB . Goldfaden MD Sun Visor Oil Free Spray, SPF 30 . £40 for 80ml, Space NK stores . CLAIMS: This protects against UVA/UVB rays - it contains titanium oxide, oxtinoxate, benzophenone and organic red tea extract. Developed by a U.S. dermatologist, it is said to be the first over-the-counter sunscreen that is 'physician strength'. EXPERT VERDICT: 'Titanium oxide reflects UVA and UVB rays off the skin, while oxtinoxate absorbs UV rays and converts them to heat, so it doesn't damage DNA - most good suncreams should contain these. 'Physician strength' sounds impressive, but I'm not sure what it means. 'Organic red tea might help mop up the harmful molecules produced as a result of UV exposure. 'It's expensive and I'd opt for a Factor 50 product.' 6/10 . Mustela is made from a avocado based ingredient, which 'aids development of the skin's barrier . Mustela Very High Protection Sun Lotion SPF 50+ . £14.95 for 100ml, from independent pharmacies . CLAIMS: Avocado Perseose (a patented ingredient based on avocados, which have a high vitamin E content), aids development of the cutaneous (skin) barrier and preserves the wealth of cells in babies' skin. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This is easily absorbed and free of parabens (preservatives) and fragrance so would be good for a baby's sensitive skin as it won't cause irritation. 'Children are more likely to burn as their skin is still developing. 'Avocado oil is a good moisturiser, but it's not clear how it 'aids the development of the cutaneous barrier'. 'I'd say there are cheaper products that would work as well.' 7/10 . Actinica Lotion . £19.99 for 80g, larger branches of Superdrug and Lloyds Pharmacies and pharmacy2u.co.uk . CLAIMS: For the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer in at-risk patients (e.g. those who have a suppressed immune system, such as transplant patients). Protects against UVA and UVB. No SPF listed. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This product was tested for two years on immuno-suppressed patients who are at high risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, because they take drugs which suppress the body's defence cells which also destroy early cancer cells. 'Patients who've already had non-melanoma skin cancers might find it reassuring to use.' 8/10 . Wilko Moisturising Sun Lotion SPF 50 . £2 for 50ml, from Wilko stores . CLAIMS: A UVA and UVB sunscreen. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This does what it says on the label. 'It has the same UVA and UVB protection ingredients as other more expensive creams, plus it is water resistant, and easily absorbed.' 9/10 . Actinica aims to prevent non-melanoma skin cancer in at-risk patients while Calypso contains UVA and UVB protection, is water resistant and won't stain clothes . Sun Ceutic 50 Anti-Ageing Sun Protection SPF 50 . £31 for 50ml, from uniqueskin.com . CLAIMS: This is said to prevent photo ageing (sun-induced skin damage) and sun spots and contains a 'powerful stem cell stimulator'; also contains hyaluronic acid, zinc oxide, titanium oxide and aloe vera. EXPERT VERDICT: 'All Factor 50 suncreams with UVA and UVB protection should protect against photo damage and sun spots. 'Hyaluronic acid is used as an anti-ageing treatment to restore lost volume in the skin, but there's limited evidence it has the same effect in a cream. 'It's not clear what the 'stem cell stimulator' is. 'This is the Holy Grail in skin care as it would reset the clock on skin cells, but I'm not aware that anybody has managed to do this yet.' 6/10 . Calypso All School Day Long Once A Day Lotion SPF 40 . £17.99 for 150ml, from Tesco, Sainsbury, and Aldi (£7 from Matalan) CLAIM: Contains UVA and UVB protection, it's water resistant and won't stain clothes. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This is OK for a school situation as children are mainly indoors. 'Suncream needs to be reapplied about every two hours if you are out in the sun because the creams get rubbed off - so this is not quite the once-a-day panacea you might anticipate.' 7/10 .","New range of suncreams claim to stop damage from infra-red A rays too .

"The president of the European Central Bank was left cowering behind his bodyguard after being sprinkled with confetti by a female protester. A flabbergasted Mario Draghi held his hands up for protection when the demonstrator leapt on to the podium and began throwing paper at him during a press conference. The woman - who identified herself later as Josephine Witt - yelled 'End the ECB dictatorship!' before being bundled off by two heavyset guards, while a third threw himself in front of Mr Draghi. The protester flashed a V-for-victory sign and smiled as the two men in grey suits carried her away by her arms and legs while the ECB boss was taken into a side room. Flabbergasted: Ex-Femen activist Josephine Witt throws confetti at European Central Bank President Mario Draghi during a press conference in Frankfurt, Germany . Taken by surprise: Mr Draghi held his hands up for protection when the demonstrator leapt on to the podium and began throwing paper at him . Police said the woman was 21 and from Hamburg. Miss Witt said she was formerly associated with Feminist activist group Femen. But the organisation, known for topless protests against what it sees as male 'economic, cultural and ideological occupation', claimed responsibility for the demonstration. Mr Draghi returned minutes later looking a little shaken but resumed his press conference, earning a small round of applause from the press corps at the end for his composure. ECB news conferences are usually sombre affairs, attended by reporters concerned with technical matters such as quantitative easing and asset-backed securities. Taken down: The woman yelled 'End the ECB dictatorship!' before being bundled off by two heavyset guards, while a third threw himself in front of Mr Draghi . Defiant: Police, who took her into custody after the incident in Frankfurt, said she was 21 and from Hamburg . 'The rest of the press conference could hardly match the excitement of the first minutes,' investment bank ING said of Wednesday's event. #Draghi became a trending hashtag on Twitter - a rare event for a central banker. An ECB spokesman said the bank was investigating the incident. Some left-wing activists accuse the ECB of enforcing budget austerity measures on eurozone countries, such as Greece, that are under financial bailout programs. It has also been accused of having too few women in top positions. As attention returned to ECB policy, Mr Draghi said the bank intends to pursue its existing bond-buying stimulus program 'until the end of September 2016 and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.' Feminist activist group Femen, known for topless protests against what it sees as male 'economic, cultural and ideological occupation', claimed responsibility for the stunt . The protester flashes a V-for-victory sign and smiled as the two men in grey suits carried her away by her arms and legs while Draghi was taken into a side room . Inflation at minus 0.1 per cent is way below the ECB's aim of 2 per cent. There was some speculation that because of a recent improvement in the economy of the 19-country eurozone, the ECB might end its stimulus program before that date. In his statement, Mr Draghi noted that the ECB would look beyond month-by-month swings in economic data when assessing how long to carry on with the stimulus. The stimulus hopes to lower market interest rates, which tends to boost lending and, by extension, economic activity. The U.S. Federal Reserve has used a similar program. Mr Draghi said the stimulus program is proceeding smoothly and has helped lower market interest rates.","Flabbergasted Mario Draghi covers face as woman throws paper at him .

"A New York-based documentary photographer has spent three years traveling the U.S. photographing and interviewing gay veterans and servicemen to share their stories of suppression, sadness and silence in a moving photo essay. Vincent Cianni, 63, said he embarked on the project, Gays in the Military, to better understand why homosexuals would enlist in the military to begin with; voluntarily signing up for a system that did, and in many ways still does, oppress them. 'It seems I spent most of my life uninterested in knowing about the military because I supported peace, the fight to end violence and injustice, and the sanctity of life,' the photographer told Vice. 'I couldn't understand why anyone would join the military, much less why gay people would join the military, an organization that shunned them.' Pieced together, Cianni's photos show commonalities between the subjects despite their different journeys, from a 92-year-old WW2 veteran to young soldiers who recently returned from Afghanistan. Many were discharged because of their sexuality, others were raped, assaulted and bullied, causing ongoing psychological damage. A major turning point for gay people in the military came in 2011 with the overturning of Dont Ask Don't Tell (DADT), a discouraging policy signed by Bill Clinton in 1993 that continued a ban on gay soldiers enlisting, but stopped investigations and 'witch hunts' into whether soldiers were gay. The bill was designed to protect the soldiers by keeping their sexuality a secret, however it forced them into the closet and further internalized their struggles. Gay and in the military: Zachary Werth (left), says he was discharged from the Army National Guard in 2010 because of his sexuality, while his boyfriend, Dustin Hiersekorn (right) left the Marine Corps due to medical reasons. They are one of the couples who appear in Gays in the Military, a stunning photo essay by Vincent Cianni documenting the stories of homosexual soldiers . Veteran: Paul Goercke, of San Francisco, is a World War II veteran who served in Okinawa, Hawaii and Saipan, said there was 'no evidence of gay life' when he enlisted with the Merchant Marines when he was 18 . 'The person I was dating was older than me and had been in the Navy quite a bit longer. She grew up under the old regime where there were active witch hunts to catch gay people in the act to get them out. I learned that culture and I was terrified the whole time I was in,' says Heather Davies (left), of Round Rock, Texas. She was a lieutenant in the US Navy from 1989 to 1998 . Togetherness: Matt McCary (right) was arrested in 2000 after being singled out by a fellow airman. He was discharged from the US Air Force within five days. David Cochenic (left) received Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, and Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. The two were photographed in Orange Park, Florida . 'I was eighteen when I joined the United States Marine Corps in 1989. Because it was pre-Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the questions were asked about sexual orientation. I already knew I was gay, but I was consciously trying to suppress it,' says Eric Alva, of San Antonio, Texas. He was the first US military casualty in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2004 . 'I wanted to think about kissing her, but I tried very desperately to force it out of my mind. I became obsessive about running and dieting; the more I exhausted my body, the less energy I would have to think about that,' reveals Debra Fowler, of Lowell, Massachusetts. She was a Korean linguist in the US Army from 1986 to 1988 . 'I’m like everybody else. I have a job. I have a career. I want the same things: a home, family, everything else. I’m not any different.' Don Bramer, of Washington, DC, a Lieutenant O-3 in the US Navy, says. He has served since 2002 and is still serving . Before DADT, which was enacted in 1993, homosexual behavior was considered a criminal offense within the military. 'In many cases, the people I interviewed and photographed had no recourse to their discharge,' Cianni said. 'At times, their entire record of serving in the military was expunged as if it never happened. 'Participating in the project served to regain their dignity and their history of serving. 'During the interviews they revisited difficult experiences, sometimes experiences they had forgotten about. 'It was an emotional catharsis for many of them.' Gays in the Military was published by Daylight Books in May 2014. It is archived at the David M. Rubestein Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Duke University and is available as an exhibition and multi-media installation. 'I was three years old the first time I had a sexual experience with my grandmother. That continued until I was 17 years old. When I was eight years old, my stepdad and step-granddad started sexually abusing me, and in rather horrible ways. I’m PTSD from Vietnam. I also have cancer from Agent Orange exposure. I’ve been HIV positive since 1987, full-blown AIDS since 1994, and I have Hepatitis C since 1989. Dying is not my responsibility; it’s part of nature. I recognize not all battles can be won,' says Bert Bares, of Houston, Texas. He served three tours of duty in Vietnam - receiving numerous commendations including the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star . 'I left the Navy to be with someone. It would not have worked out well. I would have been faced with periodic deployments given my specialty, and (my partner) didn't like the deployments, so I decided to leave. It's difficult to hide a gay relationship. When you're single, the fifth senior officer on the ship, and always being the one who shows up alone at formal functions, it's difficult to maintain a charade. I grew accustomed to the fear of what would happen if I were caught. But I also knew that if something did happen, I would not ever admit that I was gay,' Larry Baxley says. The Washington, D.C.,-native resigned from the Navy in 2005 . 'As far as actually getting into a real gay relationship, that didn't come until the military. In the Officer Basic Course there was an attraction between me and another woman but it never became a whole lot; the circumstances were not right. When I was at Fort McClellan was really when I started acting on my sexuality. When I left McClellan, I went to Fort Ritchie and had a relationship with the company commander. I was the executive officer. We had a relationship only until she was reassigned,' says Nancy Russell, of San Antonio, Texas. She is a retired Lieutenant Colonel of the US Army . 'I experienced one major relationship with a Navy lieutenant from Arkansas. He was very good in the bed department. I took him home to meet my parents. One time he was staying with us in the country and he told me he was getting married; it was a girl he'd known all his life. It upset me; it came too unexpected,' Will Chandlee revealed. He was pictured in Philadelphia. He joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1945. He is a World War II veteran . 'My mother signed for me when I was 17. The papers came and the last two questions on the form had to do with, ""Have you ever engaged in sexual relations with a person of the same sex, yes or no?"" And if yes, ""Were you the active or passive partner?"" And then they defined sodomy,' says Travis, of Chicago, who joined the Navy in 1963 . 'When Don't Ask, Don't Tell went away, it felt like a weight lifted off my shoulders. I used to joke with my family that I'm going to need counseling after I retire because I wouldn't have to be in the closet. I am beginning to feel all the years of not being me coming to a head. Sometimes the tears fall and I can't stop them,' says Joanna Gasca, of Surprise, Arizona. She joined the Air Force in 1983 . 'In 1968, everybody was in the closet, inside the military or outside the military. If you were found out, shipmates would throw you overboard just on general principle. If you lived, you were dishonorably discharged. You were ruined because in those days you couldn't ever get a job doing anything with that kind of discharge,' says Danny Meyer, pictured in his apartment in the Bronx, New York. He joined the Navy in 1968 . 'I felt an attraction to men ever since I was five years old, but I've always wanted to serve. Being in the military was a way for me to make a better life for myself,' says Charles A. Maxwell, of Decatur, Georgia, who joined the Air Force in 1985 . 'I have been gay all my life. I realized that this was something that I held within myself. I didn't tell anybody what I was feeling. I just kept it inside,' revealed Ray Chism, of the Bronx, New York. He was discharged on suspicion of being homosexual in 1984 .","Photo essay book, Gays in the Military, released by New York photographer Vincent Cianni .

"With the coffee drinking scene continuing to grow in Britain, baristas and cafe owners are putting more thought into the cakes and pasties that accompany your beverage. And while coffee matching rules are not as hard and fast as wine pairing ones, there are still some things you should consider. So the next time you order a latte and reach for a slice of cake, you might want to want to rethink your choice of dessert and have a Chelsea bun instead. The next time you order your coffee give some thought to your choice of pastry . The classic English pastry has been identified as the perfect accompaniment to a creamy latte, as well as a cinnamon swirl and a pain au raisin. And espressos are best paired with chocolate truffles or a mini raspberry coulis. Flat whites are best accompanied by a blueberry muffin, and a plain black coffee is best drunk with a glazed ring doughnut. Will Corby, from online coffee subscription company Pact Coffee, told FEMAIL: ‘It is worth remembering that the coffee used to brew different types of coffee will all have different flavour profiles so the acidity/bitterness/sweetness balance of the coffee used is something to consider when pairing it with pudding. From lattes to espresso and Americano to cafe au lait, here are Will's picks for the best puddings and pastries to accompany your cup of java. A latte (left) which has a light espresso flavour is best complemented with a Chelsea bun (right) LATTE: Cinnamon swirl, Chelsea bun or pain au raisin . Something big and hearty has to go with the light texture and sweetness of a latte. Delicate spice and toasted pastry flavours should work best, allowing you to detect the light espresso flavour through the warm milk. ESPRESSO: Chocolate truffle or mini raspberry couli . Espresso is strong and short drink, your taste buds will be exposed to very intense tastes when you drink it and any accompaniment needs to either pack an equally intense punch or complement in an alternative and cleansing way. I would suggest the chocolate truffle be paired with a fruity espresso and the raspberry couli with a more chocolatey espresso. FLAT WHITE: Muffins . A light fluffy muffin (blueberry is my choice of sweet) should accompany your flat white really well but if you are prepared to take things a little further a ham and cheese sweet/savoury muffin works even better! IRISH COFFEE: Cheese and crackers . Definitely an end of meal, post-dessert drink this is best paired with cheese - perhaps a crumbly hard cheese like a Lancashire -  and sweet crackers but maybe avoid the chutney. Glazed ring doughnuts (left) will bring out the flavour profile of a plain black coffee (right) CAPPUCCINO: Amaretti . Amaretti for dipping, avoid any extra milk or other intense flavours when it comes to this drink. BLACK COFFEE: Doughnuts . Black coffee (brewed filter or with a V60 dripper) with tends to have a more delicate flavour profile than coffee brewed in other ways. Drink it with a glazed ring doughnut to make the most of the coffee flavours. AMERICANO: Baked New York cheesecake . A cheesecake and an Americano should sit together really nicely... you will generally end up with a much more developed bitterness in an Americano and the heavy fat and intense sweetness from this cheesecake should balance that perfectly. MOCHA: Marshmallows . Opt for good quality squidgy vanilla marshmallows as this drink already has all the flavour going on. It just needs the addition of a little extra sweetness and texture from the desert. Good quality marshmallows (left) will complement the strong flavours of a mocha (right) CAFE AU LAIT: Croissant . A French classic, this should really be accompanied by croissant and blackcurrant jam. CORTADO: Custard tart . An espresso cut with a small amount of milk, this coffee is Spanish or Portuguese in origin, so I would lean towards a Portuguese (custard) tart for this. MACCHIATO: Almond brittle . To go with this espresso topped with foamy milk, choose almond brittle, which has short, intense caramelised sweetness but tastes more like toffee than sugar. AFFOGATO: Best by itself . This coffee is the dessert, in which an espresso is poured over ice cream so it should require no addition! A post-dessert drink, Irish coffee (left) is best paired with a crumbly, hard cheese such as  Lancashire (right) Latte: Coffee made with espresso and steamed milk. Espresso: Strong coffee made by forcing steam through ground coffee beans. Flat white: An Australian invention this is prepared by pouring microfoam (steamed milk with fine bubbles) over a single or double espresso. Irish coffee: Coffee made with Irish whisky and sugar, and topped with cream. Cappucino - Smaller in volume than a latte, a cappucino has hot milk and steamed milk foam with one shot of expresso. Affogato: Vanilla ice-cream topped with a hot shot of espresso. Americano: Espresso diluted with hot water. Mocha: A chocolate flavoured latte with espresso and hot milk. Cafe au lait: A light brown coffee with milk. Macchiato: Espresso with a small amount of steamed, foamed milk. Cortado: A Spanish version of the macchiato made with espresso and a small amount of steamed milk.","Head of Coffee at Pact Coffee Will Corby recommends the best pairings .

"A father falsely accused of abusing his own children and drinking the blood of babies wept today as he described his 'horrific' ordeal. Actor Ricky Dearman said his reputation was shattered after being branded the leader of a London satanic cult who trafficked of children into the UK to be tortured and killed on video. Scotland Yard investigated the 'baseless' claims but found they had been made by his children after they were tortured by their mother and her partner, who attacked them and fed them drugs. Police are now hunting for Ella Draper and Abraham Christie, who may have fled abroad, and Mr Dearman now hopes to win custody of his children, who are eight and nine and currently in care. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Ricky Dearman sobbed today as he revealed he was falsely branded the leader of a London satanic cult who masterminded the trafficking of children into the UK to be tortured and killed on video . Missing: A specialist police child abuse team is investigating Ella Draper (pictured left) and her partner Abraham Christie (right) after they forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture . Mr Dearman, who has appeared in films including the Hitman and on the stage, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire TV show: 'They'd said we were killing babies, I was shipping them in, we would cut the babies' throats and drain their blood and then would drink the blood. It's just horrific upon horrific detail. Draper was in the middle of a battle with the children's father Ricky Dearman (pictured) over access arrangements when she accused him . 'Having to go and watch these videos when your own children say these things about you, imagine what the children must have had to do in their own psyche, their own minds, to eventually give up to beatings and stuff to say this stuff. 'I get death threats. Today, yesterday, still. Comments, 'paedo', whatever. I understand, I get it. What we have is a 77-page judgement totally clearing me 100 per cent.' It had been claimed that their father, who had separated from their mother, was the head of a cult which abused and sacrificed babies, slitting their throats and drinking their blood. More than 100 people, including a school head, a teacher, a priest, social workers and police, were said to have been part of the cult which had been 'doing sex' to the children. Rumours of the cult, said to be operating in north London, were posted online as part of an internet campaign which the judge said was likely to have 'devastating consequences' for the children. They were subjected to various forms of assault including being punched, pinched and kicked in order to get them to tell the made-up stories. Mrs Justice Pauffley said at a public hearing last month in the High Court's Family Division that the children, aged eight and nine, had suffered ""incalculable"" harm after their mother and her partner forced them to ""provide concocted accounts of horrific events"". She said: 'Torture is the most accurate way to describe what was done by Mr Christie in collaboration with Ms Draper. 'Both children were assaulted by Mr Christie by being hit with a metal spoon on multiple occasions over their head and legs, by being pushed into walls, punched, pinched and kicked. 'Water was poured over them as they knelt semi-clothed.' More than four million people around the world have viewed the online material and police were forced to protect worried parents at the gates of Christchurch Primary School where the ‘main action’ was alleged to have happened, the court heard. Tests on Ella Draper's (pictured) children showed they had ingested cannabis in the months before being taken into care . The ‘grotesque’ claims against ‘blameless’ people included drugged babies being sent from abroad by courier services such as TNT and DHL to London and then sacrificed. The pair claimed cult members drank their victims’ blood and danced around with the babies’ skulls. At least seven schools were named, a swimming pool identified as a meeting place and ‘rituals’ were alleged to have been performed at a McDonald’s fast food restaurant. The children’s father, Mr Dearman, whose three-year relationship with Draper ended acrimoniously in 2007, was falsely said to be the leader of the cult, and teachers, police and even a priest to be among its more than 100 members. The judge said: ‘Many of those individuals are now living in fear because they have been identified on the internet as abusers of children and their contact details including telephone numbers, home and email addresses have been published. ‘Several of those implicated have received malicious, intimidating phone calls and emails at all hours of the day and night from all over the world. For example – “We’re coming for you. You paedo scum”.’","Ricky Dearman was branded cult leader in bitter battle over his children .

"Hundreds of payday lenders will be wiped out by tougher rules designed to protect customers, experts have predicted. It comes as Wonga, the UK’s biggest payday loans firm, today revealed it racked up a £37.3million loss last year following a significant reduction in UK consumer lending while it attempts to clean up its tarnished image. Revenues declined to £217.2million in the period, down by almost £100million. Wonga's executive chairman Andy Haste said: 'We know it will take time to repair our reputation and gain an accepted place in the financial services industry, but we're determined to deliver on our plans and serve our customers in the right way.' Hundreds of payday lenders, such as Wonga, will be wiped out by tougher rules designed to protect customers, experts have predicted . The City watchdog has forecast that just three or four payday lenders out of 400 will be left standing following the introduction of the rules in January. They include a daily interest cap of 0.8 per cent and stricter affordability checks to ensure customers can repay loans. The true picture should become clearer later this year, as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) attempts to weed out dodgy firms. Payday lenders have all had to apply for a license to trade and will learn in the coming months whether they have been successful. Robin Savage, an analyst from investment bank Canaccord Genuity described some of the tactics used by payday lenders – such as extending loan terms and adding interest to customers who cannot afford to repay - as ‘evil’. He said: ‘If firms can’t do proper checks and find customers that can repay them then they do not deserve to survive.’ Wonga, has become a lightning rod for public fury over payday lenders. Last year it took a £35million hit from writing off debts worth £220million owed by more than 300,000 customers. It was also ordered to pay £2.6million in compensation after sending fake legal letters between 2008 and 2010 to 45,000 customers who had fallen behind on their repayments. The City watchdog has forecast that just three or four payday lenders out of 400 will be left standing following the introduction of the rules in January (file picture) A charge of almost £20million will be incurred by the firm to cover compensation as well as legal and administrative costs. Wonga has been accused of trying to lure youngsters to take out payday loans with its controversial puppet adverts. Its new chairman Andy Haste – brought in to clean up the business – has ditched the adverts and admitted that it will be smaller and less profitable under the new regime. The cap on the cost of loans has reduced Wonga’s annual interest rate from 5,853per cent to 1,509 per cent since the changes were enforced in January. This will not be reflected in the figures released today, which cover last year. But the losses will include redundancy pay-outs, as Wonga is halving its UK workforce, with the loss of 325 jobs.

"Britain will still be running a budget deficit at the end of the decade despite plans to return the country to the black, the International Monetary Fund warned last night. The global watchdog said the state will continue to spend more on public services and other areas such as welfare and overseas aid than it raises in tax throughout the next parliament. The projection underlines just how hard it will be for the next government to eliminate the country’s annual deficit, which hit a record £153billion under Labour in 2009-10 and now stands at £90billion. The International Monetary Fund (managing director, Christine Lagarde, pictured) warned Britain will still be running a budget deficit at the end of the decade, despite plans to return the country to the black . The Conservatives have pledged to return Britain to the black in 2018-19 with a surplus of £5.2billion – the first since 2001. David Cameron and George Osborne then plan to run a surplus of £7billion in 2019-20. But the IMF predicted that there will still be a deficit of £7billion that year – even after a decade of austerity. The warning, in the Fund’s Fiscal Monitor report into government finances around the world, will alarm the Tories in particular as they attempt to persuade voters that only they can balance the books. But it also raises the prospect of even higher borrowing under a Labour government. The report warned that ‘uncertainties pertaining to the May elections’ mean spending may not be cut as fast as planned. The Conservatives have pledged to return Britain to the black in 2018-19 with a surplus of £5.2billion – the first since 2001 . Ed Miliband is already planning a slower pace of deficit reduction than the Tories with experts warning he could be borrowing around £30billion a year by the end of the decade. But that figure is likely to be even higher if the IMF is proved right and tax receipts do not live up to current expectations. Vitor Gaspar, director of fiscal affairs at the IMF, said it was crucial for all countries to get their public finances under control. He said governments ‘should build buffers in good times’ – echoing Mr Osborne’s pledge to ‘fix the roof while the sun is shining’. Speaking at the launch of the Fiscal Monitor in Washington, Mr Gaspar said: ‘Countries that fail to build buffers in good times often find themselves without fiscal space to manage a crisis and that is very costly.’ The bleak projections for the UK public finances come despite the IMF hailing ‘solid’ economic growth in the UK. It is now expecting growth of 2.7 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent next year – making Britain the second fastest growing economy in Group of Seven industrialised nations behind the United States.","Projection underlines next government's task to eliminate annual deficit .

"Police said Friday that they're trying to find a couple and five children who left a North Las Vegas home where a 3-year-old girl was found dead and a 4-month-old girl was so badly neglected by her 17-year-old mother that the child was hospitalized in critical condition. If Kellie Cherie Phillips, 38, and Jondrew Megil Lachaux, a 39-year-old ex-convict, aren't in Nevada, they may be in the Los Angeles or Oakland, California, areas, North Las Vegas police Officer Aaron Patty said. Patty told reporters that Phillips and Lachaux were sought for questioning, and that no Amber Alert or arrest warrant had been issued. Scroll down for video . Police are hunting for Kellie Cherie Phillips, 38, and Jondrew Megil Lachaux, a 39-year-old ex-convict, after tying the couple to a case of horrific child neglect . But he stressed that police were worried about the welfare of the five children - a 9-year-old girl and four boys ranging in age from 1 to 8 years old - who were believed to be with them. 'We have a 4-month-old fighting for life at the hospital,' Patty said. 'It is imperative for us to locate these children so that we can verify the condition of them.' He said police believe Phillips and Lachaux abandoned the house several weeks or months ago, leaving the 17-year-old girl with the two younger children in a brown stucco two-story tract home with a tile roof on Wood Thrush Place, about 10 miles northwest of downtown Las Vegas. KSNV reports the couple are the parents of the dead child. The 17-year-old was taken into custody Wednesday, after police were alerted by hospital officials to the condition of the 4-month-old. She had taken the baby to Sunrise Hospital. A police SWAT team broke into the house Thursday to find the body of the 3-year-old. The teen is the mother of the hospitalized child and sister of the dead child, and she is being held as a juvenile on child abuse and neglect allegations, Patty said. Names were not disclosed. A police SWAT team broke into the couple's house Thursday and discovered the body of the 3-year-old . Patty said the hospitalized girl was severely malnourished. Patty wouldn't describe conditions inside the home, other injuries to the children, where the 3-year-old's body was found or how she died. He said police removed items from the property, but he declined to specify them. Investigators believe the child had been dead for several days, and the teen and her baby remained in the house with the corpse until Wednesday, Patty said. The coroner has not released a cause of death. Neighbors were understandably shocked. 'Definitely bothersome,' Michael Frank told reporters. 'We got kids of our own and want them to be safe so we hope things won't happen like that again.'","Kellie Cherie Phillips, 38, and Jondrew Megil Lachaux, are likely in Nevada, Los Angeles or Oakland, police say .

"Second child: Mrs Pereiro-Mendez arrives yesterday . A top executive at Goldman Sachs secretly filmed colleagues to record their ‘sexist’ behaviour when she became pregnant. Sonia Pereiro-Mendez says she was denied millions in pay and bonuses when she announced she was expecting her first child. Male colleagues at the bank were promoted ahead of her and she was ‘mocked’ and subjected to ‘gratuitous derogatory’ comments about her childcare arrangements, she alleges. So in an attempt to prove her claim, she recorded managers at the global investment firm ‘without their knowledge’, a tribunal heard yesterday. The executive director in distressed investing – which concerns companies in financial difficulties – is suing her employer for sex and maternity discrimination. She has also lodged a claim against three senior bosses – Bryan Mix, the global head of loan trading, Nicholas Pappas, who is European head of distressed trading, and Simon Morris, global head of credit trading. Yesterday Mrs Pereiro-Mendez arrived with her second child for the first day of the hearing at Central London Employment Tribunal, which was told she would need breaks during proceedings to breastfeed. The hearing was not told who was recorded by Mrs Pereiro-Mendez, although they are likely to be among the 15 or so witnesses due to be called during the tribunal. The revelation was made by the bank’s counsel Daniel Stilitz QC, who said: ‘One key point is that... the claimant recorded some of the managers without their knowledge.’ Mrs Pereiro-Mendez, who speaks fluent German and Spanish, joined Goldman Sachs in 2003 and moved to London in 2005 after a stint in Frankfurt. But over a five-year period she claims her income took a hit because bosses ‘felt, given her pregnancy, she was no longer a significant long-term player’. Her basic salary was £250,000 in January 2010 but by January 2012 – two months after announcing her pregnancy – it had fallen to £192,000. She was also entitled to a bonus of about five per cent of the profit she generated. But in 2011 she received £200,000 rather than the £910,000 she claims she was owed. Goldman Sachs executive Sonia Pereiro-Mendez  claims after she became pregnant she was cheated out of millions of pounds . Mrs Pereiro-Mendez claims men were promoted ahead of her at the bank (pictured) while she was ‘publicly mocked,’ and subjected to ‘gratuitous and implicitly derogatory references to her childcare arrangements' Mrs Pereiro-Mendez says her bonuses and salary were cut over five years . The following year she was paid £284,000 but says she should have got a further £475,000. By 2014 there was no bonus at all, although she says she should have been given £450,000. In her claim, she says she took ‘exceptional measures’ to perform her work during maternity leave. She would attend meetings, on one occasion asking in-laws to look after the child in a car park – enabling her to ‘swiftly breastfeed her baby during breaks’. Goldman Sachs, Mr Pappas, Mr Morris and Mr Mix all deny the allegations against them . Mrs Pereiro-Mendez has accused her former manager, Allen Ukritnukun, of excluding her from meetings, claiming he ‘publicly mocked’ her before male peers ‘for no good reason’. He also allegedly ‘made overt sexist comments’, which once amounted to ‘explicit sexual harrassment’. Mr Ukritnukun was later promoted to managing director, enabling him to become ‘emboldened in his contemptuous conduct’. Mr Ukritnukun vehemently denies the allegations made against him by Ms Pereiro-Mendez and is particularly distressed by the allegation that he made a comment which amounted to sexual harassment. She also says Mr Pappas made ‘overtly discriminatory comments’ during a business trip to Germany. Mr Morris said in a statement last month that her 2011 bonus was hit partly because of her involvement in ‘significant losses’. Goldman Sachs, Mr Pappas, Mr Morris and Mr Mix deny the allegations. The case continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Sonia Pereiro-Mendez says she was treated unfairly after getting pregnant .

"The family of Adolf Hitler's minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels, pictured (above) in September 1934, is suing a publisher for royalties over a biography that used extracts from his diaries . The family of Adolf Hitler's minister of propaganda is suing a publisher for royalties over a biography that used extracts from his diaries. Cordula Schacht - whose own father Hjalmar Schacht was Hitler's minister of economics - is representing Joseph Goebbels' estate in the case against Random House Germany and its imprint Sidler. The dispute comes after Peter Longerich, a leading authority on the Holocaust and Nazi Germany, drew on the diaries for a biography called Goebbels, which was published in Germany in 2010. Now the English edition of the biography, which includes the same entries, is due to be published by Penguin Random House UK and its imprint The Bodley Head on May 7. Rainer Dresen, general counsel of Random House Germany, believes this case carries an important principal and that paying such money would be immoral. 'We are convinced that no money should go to a war criminal,' he said. 'This war criminal didn't really commit acts by his hands, but by his words. 'These words prolonged the war… [and] should not bring any money… to [his] heirs.' Mr Dresen was astonished when Schacht first demanded money after contacting the publisher as a representative of Goebbels' heirs. 'I did not want to believe that anyone can claim royalties for Goebbels' words,' he added. Scroll down for video . Last September the district court of Munich ordered the publisher to disclose its earnings. It appealed on legal, copyright and moral grounds, and the case is due to be heard in Munich on April 23. Mr Dresen has suggested to Schacht in court that royalties could be paid if she were to donate them subsequently to a Holocaust charity. Cordula Schacht, pictured (left) with her father and Hitler’s economist Hjalmar Schacht, is representing Goebbels' estate in the case against Random House Germany and its imprint Sidler over Peter Longerich's book (right) She rejected the idea on the grounds that money should go to Goebbels' family, who are thought to include descendants of his siblings. Goebbels poisoned his six children before he and his wife took their own lives. His diaries – spanning the years 1924 to 1945 - remain in copyright until the end of 2015. Copies are held in public libraries. Responsibility for the literary part of Goebbels' estate was transferred to Schacht by François Genoud, a Swiss businessman with Nazi sympathies and a friend of Schacht's father. Dr Goebbels with his wife. He poisoned their six children before he and his wife took their own lives . Mr Schacht was minister of economics in Hitler's National Socialist government from 1934 to 1937 and was president of Germany's leading financial institution, the Reichsbank. He was responsible for the unemployment and rearmament programmes. Mr Dresen said: '[He] helped Hitler finance his preparation of war.' Captured by the Allies he stood trial at the postwar International Military Tribunal at Nürnberg but was eventually acquitted. He died in 1970. Mr Dresen believes that other publishers have paid for the use of Goebbels's diaries in the past. He said: 'We're the first publishing house who avoided that - and have been sued.' Mr Longerich spoke of the censorship implications of this case: 'If you accept that Schacht controls the rights to Goebbels' diaries, then – theoretically - you give this person the right to control research.' He added: 'She could have asked to see the manuscript or [told me] that I should leave out certain passages. We cannot allow such control from a private person, whatever their interests. 'This is an absolutely unacceptable situation. It's a question not only of morality, but of professionalism for an historian.' Part of Random House's legal argument centres on the copyright ownership because the diaries were going to be published posthumously by Hitler's own publisher. Although no publisher's contract has survived, Mr Dresen points to evidence within one of diary entries of 1936 which confirms the publication plans. He believes that the Bavarian government should in fact own the copyright. Schacht declined to comment.","Cordula Schacht is representing the case against Random House Germany .

"A freight train carrying a dangerous form of ammonia derailed in a rural area of South Carolina on Friday night - causing several cars to overturn and leak, and sparking a 1.5-mile-wide evacuation. The train was traveling through Salters Pond Road and Highway 121, near the town of Trenton, shortly after 8.30pm when it derailed after apparently hitting a tree that had fallen onto the tracks. At the time, the vehicle was carrying anhydrous ammonia - a highly toxic, nitrogen-based chemical that can form explosive mixtures with air. It was also transporting non-hazardous ammonia nitrate . The derailment caused up to 15 cars to overturn and leak, authorities told WFXC. However, it is unclear whether  the affected cars were the ones holding the dangerous anhydrous ammonia. Derailment: A freight train carrying a dangerous form of ammonia derailed in a rural area of South Carolina on Friday night, causing several cars to overturn and leak.

Company: The Norfolk Southern train (file picture) was traveling through Salters Pond Road and Highway 121, near Trenton, shortly after 8.30pm when it derailed after apparently hitting a tree that had fallen on the tracks . The incident prompted a civil emergency message to be activated for residents and businesses within a 1.5-mile radius of the area. Thirty people were subsequently evacuated as a 'precaution'. Derrick Becker, public information officer for the South Carolina Emergency Management Division, told The Associated Press that no one was injured following the Norfolk Southern train crash. He added that there were 'no visible liquids or a plume' on the scene. Officials could not immediately confirm how many cars the train had all together, and Norfolk Southern could not be reached. Suzy Spurgeon, Edgefield County's director of Emergency Management, said on Friday night that haz mat crews had been sent to the scene. Firefighters were already said to be on the tracks. IMs Spurgeon did not confirm how much of the substance had leaked from the cars. Locals who were evacuated from their homes were told to gather at Mount Canaan Baptist Church on Friday night. In a tweet after the incident, State Senator Shane Massey said the train appeared to have crashed into a tree on the tracks, derailing two locomotives and at least a dozen cars, WJBF reported.

"A radical Muslim preacher has been refused a passport after the Home Office accused him of planning to join Islamic State. Trevor Brooks, an associate of Islamist firebrand Anjem Choudary, was told it was not in the public interest for him to have a passport because he is seen as a terror risk. A Home Office letter says that Brooks, also known as Abu Izzadeen, is an extremist linked to members of the banned group Al Muhajiroun. Trevor Brooks is a known associate of Islamist firebrand preacher Anjem Choudary (pictured) The letter adds: 'It is also assessed that you intend to travel overseas to Syria where you would use this opportunity to engage in terrorism-related activity, likely fighting alongside the terrorist organisation known as the Islamic State.' Brooks, 39, was released from prison last month after serving part of his 11-month term for breaching bail on a terrorist offence. The Home Office said it could not discuss individual cases. Chourdary made headlines last month when it emerged he had been invited to speak at the Oxford Union despite being on police bail on suspicion of being a member of a banned terror group. The notorious rabble rouser received an invitation by letter from the debating society, which stated it would be a 'great privilege' to have Choudary appear as the star guest. Choudary, who once said that Woolwich terror victim Fusilier Lee Rigby would 'burn in hellfire', was even offered a choice of days on which to attend the debate entitled: This house believes that radicalism is born at home. Britain's most notorious hate preacher proudly showed off his invitation after launching a hate-filled rant against Western society outside the Houses of Parliament in late March. He said: 'I am still on police bail after being arrested by Scotland Yard in September last year. 'But the police can't stop me from speaking. They can't stop me from going to the Oxford Union where I've been invited to speak.' He was one of nine men held in a series of co-ordinated dawn raids by counter terrorism police in September last year. All the men were held on suspicion of being a member of, or backing a banned terrorist group and supporting terrorism.","Preacher Trevor Brooks has been refused a passport by the Home Office .

"Britain has overtaken France to become the second biggest economy in Europe, figures showed yesterday. The UK clocked up growth of 2.8 per cent in 2014 – the strongest in the Group of Seven industrialised nations and seven times higher than France’s 0.4 per cent. According to an International Monetary Fund report, this was enough for Britain to leapfrog socialist France and become the second most powerful economy in Europe, behind Germany. The UK is expected to cement its position in the coming years as one of the fastest growing major economies in the West. The IMF is forecasting ‘solid’ growth of 2.7 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent in 2016. Scroll down for video . The UK clocked up growth of 2.8 per cent in 2014 – the strongest in the Group of Seven industrialised nations . Despite a slight downgrade for 2016 – the IMF’s initial forecast was 2.4 per cent – this is still enough for Britain to leave other EU nations trailing in its wake. Output in France is forecast to expand by 1.2 per cent this year and 1.5 per cent next year, while Germany is set to grow by 1.6 per cent then 1.7 per cent. Within the G7, only the US is expected to perform better than Britain. ‘In the United Kingdom, lower oil prices and improved financial market conditions are expected to support continued steady growth,’ the IMF said. The World Economic Outlook report, which was published yesterday, will be seen as a boost for the Conservatives ahead of next month’s General Election. The Fund also appeared to back Tory plans to return Britain to the black after years of borrowing and rising debt. It will come as another blow to Labour leader Ed Miliband who has pledged to bring traditionally Left-wing policies back to Britain – mirroring the actions of Francois Hollande in France. The French president swept to power in 2012 promising to take on the rich and big business, but the country’s economy has been in a rut ever since. Unemployment in France is 10.6 per cent compared to 5.7 per cent in Britain. George Osborne, left, said the recovery would be put at serious risk by a Labour government, as IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard, right, warned that debt levels are 'very high' in many European countries . George Osborne used last month’s Budget to boast that Yorkshire has created more jobs than the whole of France. The Chancellor yesterday said the recovery would be put at serious risk by a Labour government propped up by the Scottish National Party. ‘These IMF growth forecasts for the UK are further proof our economic plan is working,’ he said. ‘So we must finish the job.’ IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard warned that debt levels are ‘very high’ in many European countries and said ‘it would be desirable to decrease them’.","The UK has overtaken France after seeing growth of 2.8 per cent in 2014 .

As his trial opened, the prosecution outlined how Mann plunged a kitchen knife into his wife's chest in a moment of impulse. The court was told how Mann was a devoted father and husband, who had been married to Janet for a number of years after they first met as teenagers. However, since 2008, Mrs Mann's health had deteriorated and by the middle of 2014, she was suffering from dementia, was unable to go to the toilet alone and was in chronic pain. Peter Grieve-Smith, prosecuting, said: 'The strain on Mr Mann was enormous and on June 20 at 2.20am he made a 999 call and said he had killed his wife. 'He said he had stabbed her and that she had asked him to do it. 'When the police arrived they found Janet Mann lying on her bed on her back with a knife sticking out of her abdomen. 'She had died through a stab wound to her heart.' A police van outside the home of Anthony and Janet Mann in Nuneaton after Mr Mann stabbed his sick wife to death after she begged him to bring her suffering to an end . In a statement to police Mann said his wife had been in a distressed state and had told him she had had enough. He said: 'She was screaming and said she did not want live like this. I went to the kitchen and got a knife and stabbed her. I kissed her and said I love you.' The couple's two daughters both said in statements that their dad was a loving, kind man and defending QC Jonas Hankin said: 'This is a tragic case of a mercy killing.' The prosecution then asked for the original charge of murder to be replaced by one of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility, to which Mann pleaded guilty. The judge, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said: 'This is an exceptionally sad and tragic case. Janet Mann had suffered ill health for a number of years and her husband was her devoted and constant carer. 'She did not want to suffer any more and, under terrific strain, her husband acted in a moment of impulse.' Mann pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility at Leamington Justice Centre, pictured . The judge said he accepted the conclusions of two psychiatrists that, on the night of the killing, the defendant had been suffering a mental disorder, brought on by the 'enormous pressure' he was under. Addressing Mann he added: 'Neither of your daughters bears any resentment towards you and each has expressed relief that their mother's suffering has ended. 'You have been an industrious, hard-working man who has led an utterly decent life, devoted to your wife and family.' In a statement issued through his solicitor at the end of the trial, Mann said: 'The family are all relieved that Janet is no longer suffering and I am grateful of their support throughout this difficult time. 'The end of Janet's severe pain and distress is all that this case has been about. Janet was a very special lady and her family and friends all love and miss her greatly.'","Anthony Mann admitted killing his wife Janet who suffered from dementia .

"Making medical history: Mother-of-13 Annegret Raunigk, 65, from Berlin, who is due to give birth to quadruplets in weeks . She already has 13 children and is due to retire this year – so you’d think babies would be the last thing on her mind. But Annegret Raunigk is set to become the oldest woman in the world to have quadruplets – at the age of 65. The German primary school teacher will give birth in a matter of weeks to four babies, conceived following 18 months of fertility treatment. Miss Raunigk, who features in a documentary on German television tonight, said she was not too worried about the birth, adding: ‘I feel fit. I don’t think I will have any problems.’ She is in her 21st week of pregnancy after being artificially inseminated, using both donated sperm and eggs. The identity of the babies’ father is unknown. Speaking of the moment she learned she was carrying quadruplets, she said: ‘Sure, it was a shock for me. ‘Once the physician established that there are four babies inside me then I had to do some thinking.’ Miss Raunigk, who teaches English and Russian, said her gynaecologist mentioned the possibility of an abortion but she decided against this option. The mother, from Berlin, previously made headlines in Germany after giving birth to her youngest daughter Leila a decade ago, aged 55. Her 13 children – the eldest of whom is daughter Antje, 44 – are by five different fathers. Miss Raunigk’s physician, Dr Kai Hertwig, said everything was going well. He added: ‘So far her age has not come into play but quadruplet pregnancies are always a high risk. We are keeping a close watch on her heart circulatory system, but we have little or no experience with a woman of this age.’ Fame: The mother previously made headlines in Germany in 2005 after giving birth to her youngest daughter Leila a decade ago, when she was 55 (pictured) Miss Raunigk claimed she had no moral qualms about getting pregnant later in life, saying: ‘I think one needs to decide for oneself and not listen too much to the opinions of others.’ The record for the oldest woman to give birth to quadruplets is held by Merryl Fudel from the US, who was 55. The oldest woman ever to have a child was Omkari Panwar, who was believed to be 70 when she gave birth to twins in India.","German primary school teacher is in 21st week of pregnancy and 'feels fit'

"David Cameron is trying to be Prime Minister without taking the job interview, Ed Miliband claimed today ahead of tonight's TV debates. The Prime Minister will be absent when Mr Miliband and four other party leaders take part in the televised showdown, after agreeing to just one direct confrontation with his rival in the race for Number 10. Mr Miliband accused the PM of 'ducking' the chance to defend his record in government or explain how he would pay for a host of tax giveaways and spending pledges. Labour leader Ed Miliband addresses supporters during a visit to Crouch End in north London this morning . Mr Cameron has pledged to find £7billion to pay for tax cuts for lower and middle earners, by lifting the point at which people start paying tax and the level when the 40p band kicks in. He has also promised to increase the NHS budget by £8billion a year, while slashing welfare spending by £12billion. Tonight's 'Challengers' Debate' will feature Mr Miliband, Ukip's Nigel Farage, Natalie Bennett of the Greens, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. The BBC1 debate, hosted by David Dimbleby at 8pm tonight, is the second TV showdown of the campaign, following an ITV broadcast on April 2, also featuring Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg, from which no clear winner emerged. Speaking on a campaign visit to north London, Mr Miliband said: 'David Cameron has chosen not to turn up tonight to defend his record. 'Here's what I believe - I think if you are applying for the job of prime minister, the very least the British people expect is for you to turn up to the job interview. 'What I'm going to be doing is setting out the big choice facing our country, between a Labour plan to have a recovery for working families across Britain or more of the same from a government that believes that as long as you look after the rich and powerful everyone else will be okay.' The Labour leader said David Cameron was trying to be Prime Minister without taking the job interview . Tonight's 'Challengers' Debate' will feature Mr Miliband, Ukip's Nigel Farage, Natalie Bennett of the Greens, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood . Launching the Conservatives' Scottish manifesto in Glasgow, Mr Cameron denied dodging tonight's debate. Speaking alongside the Tory leader north of the border, Ruth Davidson, at the Emirates Arena, Mr Cameron insisted he had 'unblocked the logjam' that was preventing the events happening at all. 'Tonight's debate is part of the deal that was done to unblock the logjam that there was about TV debates,' Mr Cameron said. 'You are going to hear a lot of different politicians ... while you think they may be saying different things, they are all actually saying the same thing. Ed Miliband will spend the day cramming for tonight's debate after spending the morning campaigning near his home in London . 'They are saying abandon the plan that has turned this country around and got us more jobs, more livelihoods, and more business. That is the truth.' Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in the north-west, said he asked to take part in the debate, but was 'denied the opportunity' by broadcasters. The Liberal Democrat leader told LBC radio: 'David Cameron, I know, didn't want to participate in it, but I don't see why I should have been denied the opportunity to put the side of the story of what the coalition government has done, even if he didn't want to. 'I find it very odd that the debate tonight doesn't have anybody from one of the parties that have actually been trying to govern our country.' Ms Sturgeon said the debate was 'a fantastic moment of opportunity to deliver the positive change that people are looking for'. 'The SNP will be a positive and constructive voice at Westminster, ready to join others in a progressive alliance to end austerity and protect vital public services like the NHS.' Calling on Mr Miliband to 'change direction', Ms Wood said: 'We're calling for an end to austerity and instead balancing the books through job creation and infrastructure investment. 'It's time weapons of mass destruction were confined to history and we divert funds to improve standards of living and prospects for people.' In the debate, each of the five leaders will be allowed a short opening statement before Dimbleby invites questions from 200 voters. Mr Miliband will be positioned to the far left next to Ms Wood and Mr Farage to the far right next to Ms Sturgeon with Ms Bennett in the middle of the group. The 90-minute programme will cover five subjects. Each question will see one-minute opening statements followed by 10 minutes of free debate. David Cameron took questions  with employees of telecommunications company O2 at their offices in Leeds - hundreds of miles away from tonight's TV debate in London . The Prime Minister insisted he was not trying to avoid Mr Miliband - and even claimed he had 'unblocked the log jam' stopping the debates taking place . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg gestures as he stands in front of an image of UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Prime Minister David Cameron at a campaign event in Cheadle . Responding to Mr Clegg's complaint of being excluded from the debate, a BBC spokesman said: 'Over many months the broadcasters, jointly, have worked hard to ensure that their audiences were offered the best possible combination of programmes to help them engage with the election, to inform them about the issues and to scrutinise the politicians. 'The programmes which have been agreed - including the BBC debate on the 16th - involved all sides, broadcasters and parties, making a number of compromises, allowing the different elements to go ahead. 'For each of the broadcasters, ensuring due impartiality is not only a priority, but an obligation and the BBC is satisfied that the election programmes it is offering on each of its services fulfils that obligation and that all the relevant parties will have the opportunity to put their case - and to be appropriately scrutinised.'","PM  absent tonight when five party leaders take part in TV showdown .

"Fleece jackets, piles of hay, a fuzzy stuffed animal sloth and a lot of fruit were on Bobbi Gordon's shopping list when she became a surrogate mother to a big-eyed, spikey-haired little boy. A handful of animal keepers at Salt Lake City's Hogle Zoo found themselves with a tiny red-headed charge when Eve, a Bornean orangutan, died a few weeks after giving birth. Now 5 months old, the 14-inch, 11-pound Tuah is starting to crawl. Scroll down for video . A new addition: Tuah, the five month-old Bornean orangutan looks on in the Great Ape Building at Utah's Hogle Zoo on Friday . Tuah was revealed to the public on Saturday, with visitors — some of whom wore 'I met Tuah' buttons — lining up around the ape building to catch their first glimpse. About 9,000 people visited the zoo Saturday, said Erica Hansen, the zoo's community relations coordinator. 'It was such a larger day (for attendance) than we usually have in April,' she said. Gordon is one of several primate handlers who provided round-the-clock care for the infant, improvising along the way. 'We lived like an orangutan,' Gordon said. 'It was exhausting.' Orphan: Tuah's parents Eve and Elijah, both passed away last fall just a few weeks after Tuah's birth . Orangutans spend most of their time in trees. A baby orangutan instinctively clings to his mother's fur while she builds nests and scavenges for food. So Tuah couldn't be swaddled and put in a crib like a human baby; he needed to hang onto someone, even while sleeping. A zoo employee used specialized sewing machines and old fleece jackets to make a vest with strips that simulate an orangutan's fur. The animal keepers took turns wearing the vest and crawling in hay, while Tuah held tight to their chests, developing his muscle strength. But Tuah can't cling to humans forever. That's where his sister, Acara, comes in. After Tuah's birth, zookeepers began training Acara on maternal duties. Acara will turn 10 next month and is an eager-to-please orangutan that enjoys learning, Gordon said. 'Gorillas are a whole other different story, but orangutans are very easy,' said Gordon with a laugh. She called the species 'insanely intelligent.' Taken care of: After four months of round-the-clock care from zookeepers and his older sister, an orphaned orangutan baby is ready to meet the public . The first step was to teach Acara to be gentle with the infant. 'She was young and spunky, so that was our biggest worry, that she wouldn't know what was too rough,' said Gordon. They plied Acara with rewards. The more complicated the task, the higher-value the treat: from the everyday fruit to her favorite grapes and pomegranates to the foods she only gets on special occasions, like jello, granola, graham crackers, applesauce and peanuts. When Acara had mastered being gentle, zookeepers gave her a stuffed animal to teach her how to pick the baby up, hold it and flip it over. The two were introduced when Tuah was 3 months old, and for the last month, they have lived together full time, Gordon said. Acara has adjusted to child-rearing and will retrieve Tuah for animal keepers and carry him between exhibits. She also helps Tuah navigate the ropes and stops him from tripping on toys. On Saturday, Tuah spent a lot of time holding onto the ropes and occasionally wandered up to the glass, giving visitors outside the enclosure an up close glance. 'He stayed awake and fought off his nap until about 3:30,' Hansen said. Tuah's father was Eli, an orangutan who became famous for correctly predicting the Super Bowl winner seven years in a row. Eli died of cancer in September, but officials hope Tuah inherited his ability. 'Tuah's going to try it next year,' Gordon said. Lost her parents: Tuah's father, now dead, gained national fame by correctly picking the Super Bowl winner seven straight years is ready to meet the public .","Now 5 months old, the 14-inch, 11-pound Tuah is starting to crawl .

"Not one but two fast food eateries have announced major menu shake-ups, both in an apparent attempt to attract a new sort of crowd. Burger King, which has launched its summer menu, has branched out from run-of-the-mill sundaes by offering a pina colada smoothie, while Pret A Manger has gone the whole hog and started serving sit-down dinners with wine. The British sandwich chain's new concept is called 'Good Evenings', and runs from 6pm until 11pm every night, but only (for now) at its branch on The Strand in London. Wining and dining: Pret A Manger's new concept (pictured) is called 'Good Evenings', and runs from 6pm until 11pm every night, but only (for now) at its branch on The Strand in London . Pret A Manger, which up until now has been solely a breakfast and lunch operation, allows customers to order at the tills but be served at tables decked out in smart crockery and silverware. Diners can enjoy their meals along with a selection of wines and craft beers as atmospheric jazz wafts from the speakers. Chef Nick Sandler told The Evening Standard: ‘If [customers] come in and say “we’re in a real hurry we’ve only got 20 minutes” because they are going to the theatre we tell them they’ve got plenty of time to order, sit down and have their meal. ‘But equally if someone’s got a bit longer to have a glass of wine and spend an hour with us that’s fine as well, we’re pretty relaxed about it.' Newcomers: Burger King, which just launched its summer menu, has branched out from run-of-the-mill sundaes by offering a pina colada smoothie (right) Grub: Burger King's new Party in the Park menu consists of three new burgers, the Mushroom Swiss Steakhouse, the Pulled Pork BBQ Whopper and the Ciabatta Chicken Tendercrisp (pictured) Evening dishes, which largely feature on Pret's lunch menu anyway, include spicy meatballs, flat breads and dips, and baked falafel, as well as Korean BBQ pulled pork and mac ‘n’ cheese. Burger King's new Party in the Park menu consists of three new burgers: the Mushroom Swiss Steakhouse, the Pulled Pork BBQ Whopper and the Ciabatta Chicken Tendercrisp. Alongside its new Chicken Fries - essentially chip-shaped fried chicken - the fast-food joint is serving three new frozen drinks: the Frozen Lemon Limeade, the Frozen Cherry Berry Lemonade and the aforementioned Pina Colada Smoothie - which is alcohol-free. It comes shortly after Nando's announced its most extensive menu update yet, with new options including its Quinoa Salad, a 'Fino Coleslaw' made from beetroot, carrot and spiced yogurt dressing, and a Portuguese-inspired Churrasco Thigh Burger. Nando's also recently announced its most extensive menu update yet, with new options including a Quinoa Salad (bottom right), a 'Fino Coleslaw' (top right) and  a Portuguese-inspired Churrasco Thigh Burger (top left) Pret is now in good company with its lead competitor, Starbucks, who in February announced the launch of its yet-to-materialize dinner menu. Starbucks Evenings, as it has been coined, will offer a range of hot and cold meals as well as wines and beers to customers, to be served from 4pm. Stansted Airport in Essex will be the first UK location to offer the evening menu, with plans to expand the programme to additional stores. Starbucks UK will also be launching an evening menu, offering ten types of wine plus hot and cold small plates . Options will include Somerset Brie, Cheddar and Blue Stilton cheese platter with oat cakes and aromatic plum chutney (pictured) Starbucks' announcement - and no doubt now Pret's - did cause a bit of a stir with certain alcohol-related charities, who expressed concern that such a large firm is licensing some premises. Emily Robinson, of Alcohol Concern, said: ‘We hope Starbucks will take their responsibility as an alcohol retailer very seriously by ensuring the training of staff and under-age checks are adequate, and that responsible drinking is encouraged. 'It’s a bit disappointing to see another establishment now selling booze which will limit those customers who are in recovery or just wanting an alcohol-free environment.’","Burger King is now offering alcohol-free pina colada smoothies .

"The 150 people killed in the Germanwings air disaster in the French Alps have been remembered at a memorial service in Germany today. The Cardinal who led the service at the historic Cologne cathedral urged forgiveness for all of the victims - including co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who is widely blamed for 'deliberately' crashing the jet after locking the captain out of the cockpit. An investigation into the disaster revealed that Lubitz previously suffered from severe depression and his home computer showed he had researched ways of committing suicide. German President Joachim Gauck said the tragedy had not only provoked grief and sorrow, adding: 'We're being confronted with a disturbing act of destruction. Speaking at the ceremony, he said: 'We can't find an answer to the question of why so many people had to die because of a decision that one person made.' Small wooden angels were placed on the pews to comfort the 500 bereaved relatives of the doomed flights who were among 1,500 to attend the touching service.

Mourners lay flowers and lit candles on the stairways leading to the cathedral - and outside the city's main railway station nearby. A bouquet of white tulips left at the foot of the cathedral had a card with the message 'depression is incalculable,' referring to co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who suffered from the illness. Cologne's Cardinal Rainer Woelki - who will lead the ceremony - urged compassion for all those who died in the crash including Lubitz, saying: 'There are 150 victims.' The Germanwings Airbus 320 was en route to Duesseldorf from Barcelona when it crashed in the French Alps on March 24 - killing everyone aboard. Germany was devastated by the loss of its citizens which included 16 young students and two teachers from a high school in the small town of Haltern-am-See who were returning from a class trip to Spain. Co-pilot Lubitz, who had been diagnosed as suicidal in the past, is believed to have deliberately flown the plane into the mountainside after locking the captain out of the cockpit. Disastrous: Among those who died when the plane went down in the French Alps (pictured) were 16 young students and two teachers from a high school in the small town of Haltern-am-See . Remains: Co-pilot Lubitz who is widely blamed for the crash had previously been diagnosed as suicidal . Investigators suspect Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit before putting the plane into descent and increasing the jet's speed several times as it went down. Aviation industry doctors have since demanded that German pilots undergo more extensive medical checks, while several airlines worldwide have changed rules to require two crew in cockpits at all times. Lufthansa - the parent company of Germanwings - cancelled its 60th anniversary celebrations set for April. It also placed memorial pages in major newspapers dedicated to the memory of passengers and staff who died in the disaster saying: 'We will never forget them.' Loved ones of victims previously attended a memorial event near the disaster site at the village of Le Vernet in the French Alps. On April 13, foreign ministers of Germany, Spain and France also paid tribute to the victims at Barcelona airport, where the passengers embarked.","1,500 people are attending the touching ceremony at Cologne cathedral .

"A two-metre South American boa constrictor is on the loose after police mistakenly believed it was a harmless python and set it free. A bizarre search is now unfolding on Queensland's Gold Coast as authorities try to locate the reptile which could pose a threat to local wildlife and even people's pet cats and dogs. Snake catcher Tony Harrison warned that if the large-predatory boa has Inclusion Body Disease 'it can be unbelievably contagious if that gets loose in Australia'. Mr Harrison told Daily Mail Australia: 'Police should have called the snake catchers and we'd have euthanised it. That was very silly of them.' Scroll down for video . Queensland Police found the snake at the base of a tree on a footpath (pictured) in Surfers Paradise and then released it into the wild . Queensland Police say officers were called to The Esplanade at Surfers Paradise on or about March 26, to respond to reports of a large snake spotted at the base of a tree on a footpath. The officers released the reptile into bushland at the Southport Spit, but the incident has since sparked an operation by Biosecurity Queensland officers who say the snake isn't a harmless python after all. Mr Harrison believes the snake - likely to be an illegal import that was kept as a pet - will be found 'within a month' but there are fears if the boa is pregnant there could then be up to 30 live young on the loose. The reptile which could pose a threat to local wildlife and even people's pet cats and dogs (stock photo) South American boa constrictors  have varying patterns of cream, brown, tan, gray, and black with ovals and diamonds . 'They can eat up to three times their girth, no more or less than pythons and including a cat or small dog, but the biggest problem is if it was going to give birth,' Mr Harrison warned. Biosecurity Queensland is working with the Gold Coast City Council in a bid to find the snake. 'Police originally caught it in a sheet after spotting it under a tree in Surfers Paradise before they released it in bushland at The Spit,' a spokesman said. 'They say they captured the snake when it started moving towards people.' South American boa constrictors are pinkish or tan in color and have varying patterns of cream, brown, tan, gray, and black with ovals and diamonds.","The boa constrictor is on the loose on Queensland's Gold Coast .

"William Beggs (pictured) is known as the Limbs in the Loch killer for raping, murdering and dismembering Barry Wallace, 18, in 1999 . A convicted murderer who murdered and dismembered his teenage victim has had boiling hot water thrown over him in an apparent revenge attack in a Scottish prison. William Beggs, 54, known as the Limbs in the Loch murderer, was described by police at the time of his conviction in 2001 as a 'serial killer in the making'. Beggs is serving a life sentence in Saughton Prison, Edinburgh, for raping, murdering and dismembering Barry Wallace, 18, in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, in 1999. The teenager's limbs and torso were found in Loch Lomond and his head was dumped in the sea off the Ayrshire coast. Beggs screamed in pain as boiling water was thrown over his face and hands in the cell attack, the Scottish Daily Record reported yesterday. The alleged attacker was due for release this year and has since been moved to Shotts Prison. He reportedly told friends he was taking revenge after Beggs attacked him soon after he arrived at the prison. It is understood Beggs was treated for burns in the prison's infirmary but did not need to attend hospital. The teenager's limbs and torso were found in Loch Lomond (pictured) and his head was dumped in the sea . Supermarket worker Mr Wallace vanished on December 5 1999, after a Christmas night out with colleagues in his home town of Kilmarnock. In 2001 a jury found Beggs took the teenager to his flat and subjected him to a serious sexual assault. Beggs is serving a life sentence for murdering and dismembering shop worker Barry Wallace (pictured) He then murdered him and cut up his body. Shortly after the crime, Beggs, originally from Northern Ireland, fled to the Netherlands. After lengthy extradition proceedings, he was ordered in January 2001 to be returned to Scotland to face trial. After the High Court jury delivered their majority verdict and found him guilty it was revealed Beggs was once cleared of a similar murder by appeal court judges on a technicality. Beggs was jailed in 1987 at Teeside Crown Court for murdering a barman he met in a gay nightclub by slashing his throat, only to have the conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal, the BBC reported at the time. The court also learned that at the same trial Beggs was convicted of two charges of wounding and sentenced to four months for each. He was also jailed for six years in 1991 for slashing the leg of a man who escaped by jumping through a glass window. Beggs has repeatedly tried and failed to have his conviction overturned at the Supreme Court.","Infamous Limbs in Loch killer William Beggs was attacked in prison .

Compounds in the plant have been known to alleviate joint pains, treat mood disorders and even help pets lose weight. Stock image of a chocolate labrador is pictured . Research has also suggested that CBD can relieve pain and discomfort in dying pets and calm animals down. Cannabis plants contain more than 60 unique compounds called cannabinoids. Two of the most common compounds are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) - the psychoactive chemical that produces the cannabis high - and cannabidiol (CBD). Cannabis plants contain more than 60 unique compounds called cannabinoids. Two of the most common compounds are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) - the psychoactive chemical that produces the cannabis high - and cannabidiol (CBD). Marijuana plants contain high levels of THC, classed as illegal in many countries and states, and hemp contains very little. While hemp contains higher levels of legal CDB. Hemp is legally refined in industrial factories for products such as hemp seed foods, hemp oil, wax, resin, rope, cloth,  paper, and fuel. As a result, its production and sale is legal in many countries and states including the UK. Hemp naturally contains compounds which affect the endocannabinoid system, an internal pathway found in mammals. Nearly every tissue contains receptors which respond to the components found in cannabis. Once triggered, these receptors activate a chemical reactions aimed at supporting the body's natural stress response mechanisms.

Nearly every tissue contains receptors which respond to the components found in cannabis. Once triggered, these receptors activate chemical reactions that boost the body's natural stress response mechanisms. Canna Companion, based in Sultan in Washington, uses hemp from the Cannabis sativa strain in its capsules and biscuits for both cats and dogs. It is run by vets Dr Greg Copas and Dr Sarah Brandon. 'The phytocannabinoid and terpenoid profiles work perfectly for pets,' explained the firm. 'Due in part to their small body size, dogs and cats can take advantage of small amounts of CBD, THC and other cannabinoids found in hemp and can therefore reap the benefits of this great plant.' 'We are not interested in, nor are we advocating the administration of, the well-known psychotropic compound THC, in concentrations sufficient to produce the 'high' or psychotropic effects which are normally associated with marijuana. 'We are not advocating the administration of marijuana, by any route, to animals in order to produce medical benefit or to produce any psychotropic effect. Canna Companion, based in Sultan in Washington, uses hemp from the Cannabis sativa strain in its capsules and biscuits and ships internationally. While Canna-Pet sells boxes of CBD biscuits (pictured) for $16.49 (£11.20) and these can be bought online in any state of the US, but not shipped internationally .

Marijuana plants and leaves (left) contain high levels of THC, classed as illegal in many countries and states, and hemp contains very little. While hemp contains higher levels of legal CDB. Biscuits, such as those sold by Treat-ibles (right) contain less than 0.3 per cent THC meaning they can legally be sold . 'Rather, we are advocating the administration and continued research into the non-psychotropic compounds  for the purposes of therapy in animals.' Each of its capsules contain a combination of compounds found in hemp as well as so-called flavonoids, which are already found in cat and dog foods. Hemp additionally contains Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids and vitamin B6. And because Canna Companion contains less than 0.3 per cent THC and is not intended for human consumption, it meets the current definition of hemp supplements under US federal law. Canna Companion asks for a pet's information and a referring veterinarian when orders are placed, and will make recommendations on sizing and frequency of administration. Capsules start at $1 each. It ships to all regions other than Australia, where a licence is required to import hemp products into the country. Another firm called Auntie Dolores, which already specialises in the sale of medical marijuana in food products for humans, recently launched its Treat-ibles range. Hemp contains compounds that affect the endocannabinoid system, an internal pathway  in mammals. Nearly every tissue contains receptors and once triggered, these receptors activate reactions that boost the body's natural stress response. CBD is not psychoactive, and has actually been found to reduce the effects of THC . A box of Treat-ibles biscuits costs $22 (£15) but can only be bought online by people in California. A third firm is Canna-Pet. It sells boxes of CBD biscuits for $16.49 (£11.20) and these can be bought online in any state of the US, but not shipped internationally. Canna-Pet describes itself as 'one of the first companies to discover that some animals thrive on hemp-based supplements containing non-psychoactive, hemp-based cannabinoids'. The US government defines hemp as cannabis that measures less than 0.3 per cent in THC, which means Treat-ibles and Canna-Pet can be sold legally, and why the latter can be sold across state lines. Each site explains how much CDB is advised for dogs and cats of varying sizes and gives advice on frequency. However, as Canna Companion added: 'While Canna Companion will likely benefit your pet, it is not designed to be a magic bullet, but rather should be part of a comprehensive care program. 'It works best when admininstered under the direction of a veterinarian as part of a total health care regimen.' It advises pet owners never change prescribed medication doses or frequency of administration without advice from a vet.","Dubbed 'pet-pot', snacks are used to treat joint pain and mood disorders .

"Sauntering down leafy avenues past typical Dutch step-­gabled buildings, carpets of crocuses, the occasional cyclist whooshing quietly by and the sun bouncing off the canal, I can think of few more pleasant places to spend a spring weekend than The Hague. This is also prime territory for a gallery­ lover like me: the beautiful, elegant and not-­too-­big Mauritshuis was restored last year. This is also the home of Girl With A Pearl Earring, the 'Dutch Mona Lisa'. But I am not only here for the Vermeer, Rembrandt and Hals. Much more than a village: The Parliament Building stands proud in The Hague - a hidden gem of a city . There is the Escher gallery (devoted to that geometry-­defying genius), the contemporary art Gemeentemuseum and more. Meanwhile, I am being charmed by an unsuspected delight: this medieval city by the sea. 'City? This is Europe's biggest village,' says my guide, Remco Dörr. He is right: The Hague, despite being home to Holland's royal family and an eye-­catching parliament, was classed as a village until Louis Bonaparte (Napoleon's brother and king of Holland) set up here in 1806. It has a genteel moat/canal, which encircles the historic centre. We step across and in front of an approaching car, which slows down deferentially. Remco tells me that many traffic lights have been taken out for aesthetic reasons. 'Now, the cars are very careful,' he says. The Hague is home to one of the cornerstones of European art - Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring . You have to love that kind of Dutch logic - though it doesn't seem to apply to cyclists, who rule the place. Next time, I will rent a bicycle, although the trams and buses are easy and cheap (an all-day pass costs €7.70/£5.60). Over the moat, we are in Noordeinde street. Remco ushers me into what used to be part of a palace, and still has huge chandeliers and ornate mirrors. This cobbled part of town is home to private galleries and unassuming cafes (I snacked in the Juni Lekkernijen), as well as altogether more assuming ones. HanTing is the latest Michelin star in town and the best place for Indonesian cuisine. The most prized Dutch colony was apparently run from The Hague (aka 'the Widow of Indonesia'). For summer: the excellent Grapes & Olives and the Café de Bieb on Veenkade will have boats on a newly renovated bit of canal, with music and boat trips planned, including a tour at the Kompaan brewery (I can vouch for the product). My art gorging finishes at the Panorama, an extraordinary, 14 ft-­high circular panorama of The Hague's seaside resort, Scheveningen, painted by Hendrik Mesdag. I take a 15-minute tram to the place itself and gorge on scallops and sole at Catch by Simonis on the harbour front. The Hague has netted a new fan.

"The messy divorce between chef Bobby Flay and actress Stephanie March just got uglier. On Sunday, the New York Post's Page Six alleged that the marriage breakup was the result of Flay having an affair with his assistant Elyse Tirrel, who's 28. But the celebrity chef's  business partner Laurence Kretchmer moved swiftly to dismiss the claims, saying that if Flay, 50, had been having an ongoing affair with an employee, he would know about it. Scroll down for video . The other woman? It was alleged Sunday that chef Bobby Flay has been having an affair with his assistant Eliyse Tirrell and that it led to the breakdown of his marriage to Stephanie March . Secret affair: Page Six claimed Flay, 50, has been seeing Tirrel, who's 28, for three years and that according to a friend of March, the actress learned of the relationship with the former hostess just after Thanksgiving 2014 . Page Six reported that Tirrell is a 'singer/actress who worked as a hostess at the chef's Bar Americain in 2008 and became his assistant.' The gossip site claimed that Flay, who filed for divorce from March, 40, in April, has been cheating on the Law & Order:SUV star for three years with  Tirrell. March's friend Maia Madison, a writer and actress, told Page Six that March arrived 'sobbing uncontrollably' at her home just after Thanksgiving after finding out about the affair. Madision went on to say that Tirrell 'is about to ­become the Monica Lewinsky of the food world.' Messy divorce: Flay filed for divorce earlier this month saying that his 10-year marriage to Law & Order: SVU star March has 'irretrievably broken down' After the story ran, Flay's representative released a statement to the media saying: 'We will continue to refrain from responding to the continued efforts by certain parties to spread rumors and innuendo.' 'This specific allegation was in a letter sent from one attorney in this case to the other. It was written and then leaked specifically to try to insert this story into the press, and that’s unfortunate.' The statement continued:: 'Even more unfortunate is that all of this is being done in order to renegotiate a prenuptial agreement that was agreed to over a decade ago and never amended during the marriage.' Kretchmer defended his friend and insisted that none of the claims about an affair with his assistant are based in reality. He is quoted as saying that the young woman is' a great and valued employee.' 'If she had an affair with Bobby it would have been reported to me. That has never even been suggested, and people like to talk,' Kretchmar said. 'Have Bobby and Elyse been seen together? Yes, that’s her job.' He then suggested that there is more mud-slinging to come in the ugly battle between the former couple whom he has known for 14 years. 'As ugly as Stephanie is going to look [when this news comes out], she will look uglier when other things come out,' Kretchmer told Page Six. Bitter battle: March, 40, is contesting the prenuptial agreement the couple signed ahead of their marriage that means the famous chef, who's worth about $20 million, only has to pay her $5,000 a month in alimony . The Food Network chef filed court documents filed on April 10 saying that his 10-year marriage has 'irretrievably broken down.' The actress, though, has mounted a legal challenge to the prenuptial agreement that the now estranged couple signed which says Flay, reported to be wort about $20 million, only has to pay her $5,000 per month. In return, March has accused the chef of 'bullying through economic warfare.' March's lawyer said the famous chef won't let her and her sick mother Laura Derby stay in their $8m marital Manhattan home unless she signs a press release alleging their split was amicable. Happier times: March was Flay's third wife and appeared as a guest judge on several of his Food Network shows. The couple are pictured here in September 2009 in New York City .","It was claimed Sunday that the Food Network star has been cheating on his wife with assistant Elyse Tirrell for three years .

"Saudi Arabia has been condemned for beheading an Indonesian domestic worker who was 'suffering from mental illness'. Her home country's leadership is furious that Siti Zainab's family was not notified before her execution this morning - and summoned Saudi Arabia's ambassador to complain about her death. While Amnesty International says her killing in the holy Islamic city of Media this morning 'smacks of a basic lack of humanity'. The domestic worker was sentenced to death in 1999 after confessing to stabbing her employer who allegedly mistreated her to death. She was on death row for over 15 years while Saudi Arabian authorities waited for the victim's youngest child to reach adulthood - to decide whether or not the family wanted to pardon Zainab or demand her execution. Executed: Indonesia and human rights groups are furious that Saudi Arabia executed domestic worker Siti Zainab without notifying the country's officials or her family . Indonesian President Joko Widodo and three of his predecessors had previously written to the Saudi king asking for the victim's family to forgive Zainab. But the sentence was carried out despite their claims that Zainab's family and officials were not given adequate notice or information before she was killed. Indonesia's foreign ministry released a statement saying: 'From the beginning, the government has struggled to provide her with assistance and has asked the family [of the victim] for forgiveness. 'The Indonesian government filed a protest against the Saudi Arabian government for not giving prior notification to Indonesian representatives or to the family over the execution date.' Riyadh's ambassador to Indonesia  was 'surprised' to be summoned by the foreign ministry but said he would follow up on Jakarta's concerns. Mustafa Ibrahim Al-Mubarak said: 'The problem is not about the court and the execution, it is about the date of the execution... I have to check what went wrong.' Before her arrest, Zainab sent two separate letters to her employer's son to say the woman she eventually killed had been cruel to her. The Indonesian government has issued a statement condemning Saudi Arabian authorities' failure to notify them and Zainab's family before executing her. Desperate plee: Indonesian President Joko Widodo had previously written to the Saudi king asking for the Saudi victim's family to forgive Zainab . A UN resolution has urged states not to execute or impose the death penalty 'on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder'. 'Imposing the death penalty and executing someone with a suspected mental illness smacks of a basic lack of humanity,' according to Amnestry International's Middle East and North Africa Programme Director. Philip Luther added: 'This practice has been widely condemned on the world stage and Saudi Arabia should take this opportunity to reconsider its stance on the death penalty.' She had no legal representation at any stage and did not have access to a consular representative during the police interrogation when she had made her 'confession', according to Amnesty. They claim the police knew she suffered from mental illness at the time of the interrogation. The charity's 2014 global report on the death penalty released earlier this month said Saudi Arabia once again ranks among the top five executioners in the world. So far in 2015, Saudi Arabia has executed at least 60 people, most of them by beheading which compares to 90 executions in the entirety of 2014. Philip Luther added: 'Whatever the misguided purpose behind Saudi Arabia's shocking spike in executions so far this year, it should draw international condemnation. 'The Kingdom's authorities must halt this execution spree and establish an official moratorium on the use of the death penalty.' Human rights groups are using Zainab's beheading to urge Indonesia to abandon its support for the death penalty as it presses ahead with plans to execute several foreigners on death row for drug crimes. But Jakarta remains determined to execute several drug traffickers - including citizens from Australia, France, Nigeria, Ghana, Brazil and the Philippines - as soon as possible.","Siti Zainab was executed in holy city of Medina after 15 years on death row .

"My, my. At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender. So go the opening lyrics to Abba's Eurovision winner. But it seems the message hasn't got through to the majority of us. Research has revealed that three out of four people have little or no knowledge about the Battle of Waterloo. Only just over half (53 per cent) know the Duke of Wellington led the British forces, while one in seven believe that it was the French who were victorious in 1815. Veeker's rendering of the battle between Wellington's Anglo-Dutch army and the French: Forty-seven per cent of 2,070 adults polled said they didn't know who led British forces against France in the battle . The survey, by the National Army Museum ahead of the 200th anniversary on June 18, also showed that young people are more likely to associate Waterloo with the London railway station or the Abba song than the actual battle – with one in eight of those aged 18-24 saying they'd never heard of it. Forty-seven per cent of 2,070 adults polled said they didn't know, or they thought the man in charge was either Sir Francis Drake, Sir Winston Churchill, King Arthur or even Harry Potter's wizardry mentor Albus Dumbledore. More than a quarter of all the people polled (28 per cent) have no idea who won the Battle of Waterloo, while one in seven (14 per cent) wrongly believe the French were victorious over the British. Two-thirds (67 per cent) are unaware that June 18th this year is the bicentenary of Waterloo. Now the National Army Museum, together with Waterloo 200 - the organisation approved by the government to support the anniversary - and other cultural organisations, are planning a series of events to bring Waterloo to life . Janice Murray, Director-General at the National Army Museum, said: 'Despite the Battle of Waterloo being an iconic moment in British history, UK public awareness is dramatically low. 'The National Army Museum is seeking to bridge this knowledge gap through the creation of a series of innovative pop-up events and regional exhibitions around the country making the dramatic story of the battle accessible for all.' Abba at the 1974 Eurovision song contest: Young people are more likely to associate Waterloo the Abba song than the actual battle . Young people were also likely to associate the battle with the London Station, with one in eight of those aged 18-24 saying they'd never heard of the battle . The Battle of Waterloo took place on June 18th, 1815, when British and Prussian forces, under the command of Duke of Wellington, halted the advance of French Army in Belgium. The bloody battle claimed the lives of 65,000 of the 200,000 men that took part, and saw the defeat of Napoleon, ending his reign as Emperor of France and ushering in a period of peace following years of war in Europe. The National Army Museum, based in Chelsea, west London, is currently closed for redevelopment. It is due to reopen next year .","At Waterloo bicentenary, research shows adults know little about the battle .

"Some of our most spectacular views of Mars have been presented on small, skinny strips of imagery. Now, for the first time, scientists have joined these individual 30 to 60 mile (50 to 100km) wide strips to create a single complete 3D map. The new map allows astronomers to 'stand' on planetary surfaces and could help explain how water and lava once flowed across the red planet. Scroll down for video . Some of our most spectacular views of Mars have been presented on small, skinny strips of imagery.Now scientists have, for the first time, joined these individual 30 to 60 mile (50 to 100km) wide strips together to create a single complete 3D map. Pictured is a view of a section of the image map Mosaic 'MC-11 East' is on the right and the topographical view can be seen on the left. The warmer colours show a higher elevation . The colour-coded terrain models show the impressive height of the Meridiani Planum region at up to 820ft (250 metres) above the surface, seen in red. This is in contrast to the blue 1,6404ft (5,000 metres) depth of the lower-lying Chryse Planitia region. The first mosaic, pieced together by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), comprises 1.4 million square miles (2.3 million square km) of the surface. It covers the vast crater-strewn highland region of the red planet, parts of the Ares Vallis outflow channel, the chaotic Aram Chaos region as well as the Meridiani Planum and Chryse Planitia plains. The new map allows scientists to 'stand' on planetary surfaces and could help explain how water and lava once flowed across Mars. Pictured is a colour-coded perspective view showing the topography of the upper course of Ares Vallis near the Chryse Planitia plains . Constructing a 3D model such as this requires a spacecraft to look at the same surface feature twice at a different angle. The High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on Mars Express is the only experiment that can do it with just one pass. HRSC has nine scan lines that point fore, aft and straight down. This allows it to see a feature on approach, when its underneath and as it fades into the background. HRSC has, during 14,000 orbits, transmitted 293.34 gigabytes of data to Earth. 'Gerhard Mercator and Carl Friedrich Gauss measured Earth, and with our survey of Mars we are following in their footsteps,' says Ralf Jaumann, a DLR planetary scientist. The mosaic extends over 1,120 miles (1800km) from north to south and 810 miles (1,300km) from east to west. Individual stereo and colour images from a total of 89 Martian orbits were combined to create the map. 'The strips were recorded at varying resolutions, with the sun at different positions and under varying weather conditions,' Jaumann said. 'The challenge was to combine them uniformly and without visible borders to form one large image.' Perspective views look into the Ares Vallis outflow channel or into a crater altered by typical Mars erosion processes typical on Mars. 'At present, you cannot create a better image of the surface of Mars to show, for example, of the effects of flood and drought,' said Jaumann. Pictured are parts of the Ares Vallis outflow channel. Constructing a 3D model such as this requires a spacecraft to look at the same surface feature twice at a different angle. HRSC on Mars Express is the only experiment that can do it with just one pass . The data for this wide-area topography of Mars was acquired by Mars Express' High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC,) which has been orbiting the red planet since 2003. Nine sensors record the surface of the planet from different angles and make it possible to map our planetary neighbour at high resolution, in colour, and in the third dimension – elevation. HRSC has, during the course of more than 14,000 orbits, recorded and transmitted a total of 293.34 gigabytes of data to Earth. About 97 percent of the planet has been recorded with image resolutions of up to 330ft (100 metres). By around 2018, the team from DLR, wants to represent the whole of Mars as one coherent mosaic.

"Anti-Semitic attacks surged worldwide by 38 per cent last year, with the highest number of incidents occurring in France, an annual study has revealed. The report, by Tel Aviv University's Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry, said 766 violent anti-Semitic acts were carried out around the world last year - marking a huge increase from the previous year. Arson, vandalism and direct threats against Jews, synagogues and other Jewish institutions were included in the figure, making 2014 the worst year for such attacks since 2009. The study said: 'The overall feeling among many Jewish people is one of living in an intensifying anti-Jewish environment that has become not only insulting and threatening, but outright dangerous. In particular, it cited 'alarming reports especially from Western Europe and North America'. Anger in Western Europe over Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip last July and August, as well as anti-Jewish caricatures in the media and social networks had helped to turn anti-Semitism into an 'almost daily phenomena seen and felt in every sphere of life', the report said. In France, the number of anti-Semitic attacks rose to 164 in 2014 compared with 141 in 2013. In January this year, four hostages were killed in a Paris kosher supermarket in violence that began when Islamist militants carried out a massacre in the office of the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly. Britain registered 141 violent incidents against Jews in 2014, after 95 a year earlier. In one of the most serious attacks a victim was called a 'Jewish c***' and then hit with a glass and a baseball bat in London. In Manchester, a man was knocked off his bike and kicked while on the ground by a group of youths who called him a 'Jew'. In January this year, four hostages were killed in a Paris kosher supermarket in an anti-Semitic attack . The violence began when Islamist militants carried out a massacre in the office of Charlie Hebdo magazine . And a Jewish girl had deodorant sprayed in her face by a 12-year-old fellow pupil who said to her 'gas the Jews' at a school in Edinburgh. The number of anti-Semitic acts in Germany and Italy more than doubled, to 76 and 23 respectively. In Western Europe in particular, the study said, 'the issue is not only a matter of having more security means provided by the respective states, but rather the ability to lead a full Jewish life... especially under heavy police and even army protection'. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stoked controversy in February when he called for 'mass immigration' of European Jews to Israel following a deadly shooting at a synagogue in Denmark. Under Israel's Law of Return, anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent has a right of immigration to Israel and, once there, can receive Israeli citizenship automatically.","Anti-Semitic attacks worldwide have surged by 38 per cent, study reveals .

"They are supposed to be a girl's best friend - or at least her most valuable. But the diamond ring appears to have lost its sparkle according to experts who claim that women are abandoning the traditional jewel in favour of more exotic gems. The huge increase in demand for coloured stones, such as sapphires and rubies, has seen their prices soar. Scroll down for video . Kate Middleton proudly wore a Ceylon sapphire once owned by Princess Diana as her engagement ring . And experts say the trend might prove that diamonds are not forever after all, as the value of the jewels has been vastly overtaken by more fashionable stones. Demand has seen the value of some coloured stones increase by more than 2,000 per cent over the last ten years, with leading auctioneers now branding them a better investment than diamonds. Celebrities such as Kate Middleton, who proudly wore a Ceylon sapphire once owned by Princess Diana as her engagement ring, have driven the craze. A-list stars Beyoncé, Naomi Watts, Rosamund Pike and Mila Kunis have also played their part by flashing their beloved coloured gems on the red carpet. The number of women picking their own engagement rings is also thought to have had an effect, with men always likely to choose a traditional diamond. While diamonds are still broadly worth more money than softer stones such as emeralds, the increase in price generated by coloured stones in recent years has far overtaken diamonds. A-list stars Rosamund Pike by flashing beloved coloured gems on the red carpet . As the gems are much rarer than diamonds the surge in demand - especially from Asia - has played a significant part in driving up their cost. The surging popularity of coloured stones is one of the reasons leading auctioneers Bonhams include them in most sales around the world, alongside diamonds. Its auctioneers were delighted when a pair of 1930 Cartier art deco ruby and diamond brooches recently sold for £482,500, far outstripping the presale estimate of £80,000 - £120,000. A single-stone ring by Van Cleef & Arpels featuring a Burmese ruby weighing 13.34 carats, sold for £350,500 to a Hong Kong buyer, breaking price-per-carat records in the UK last year. Jean Ghika, head of jewellery in the UK and Europe at Bonhams, said that as well as being fashionable colured stones are also becoming seen as a sound investment. She said: 'There is a new move towards colour. Women are bolder in their choices and looking at alternatives to diamonds when it comes to engagement rings and everyday jewellery. 'Women are also in constant pursuit of something truly original, and a coloured stone, where every example is different they are able to have something unique. 'As ever, fashion is partly celebrity-led and we're seeing some of the world's biggest stars looking stunning in coloured gemstones on the red carpet.' Actress Mila Kunis also played her part, seen here wearing ruby jewellery to the Jupiter Ascending premiere . A ring featuring a Sri Lankan sapphire weighing 30.08 carats was recently sold by the auctioneers for £326,500. Bonhams said that a near identical ring sold a decade earlier for only £11,950, equating to a 2,200 per cent increase in price-per-carat. Miss Ghika added: 'Diamonds are typically seen as the more 'robust' area in the gemstone market in terms of seeing a return on investment. 'But figures over the last decade demonstrate that coloured stones have actually overtaken diamonds in terms of growth.' A new world record for the most expensive ruby, regarded as the most valuable coloured gem, was set last year when a 8.62 carat Burmese stone sold for £5.4million.","Increased demand for coloured stones has seen their prices soar .

The two men were heading to Scott's home on April 4 for a cookout when Scott was killed by a cop . Killed: Scott, 50, ran from his car when he was pulled over by North Charleston officer Michael Slager, right, for a broken tail light. As he ran away, Slager shot the father-of-four multiple times, killing him . Scott jumped out of the car fled the scene - and was shot multiple times in the back by officer Michael Slager in a horrifying incident captured on a passerby's cell phone camera. Peper said that his client did not know why Scott ran from the car but that he said there was no confrontation. Following the stop 'there was never a conversation between Pierre and Walter regarding the reason for the stop, what his intentions were - anything along those lines,' Peper said. Scott was behind $18,000 in his child support payments and family members have said he may have run because he was worried about going to jail. Scott, who is black, ran away and a video showed Slager, who is white, firing eight shots at Scott. Fleeing: A dash cam video still provided by the North Charleston Police Department shows Scott leaving his car after a traffic stop on April 4. His passenger said he does not know why Scott fled . Gunned down: A passerby captured this video of Slager shooting Scott dead as he tried to flee the scene . Fulton said he heard the crackle of a Taser and shots fired. From where Scott's car was parked, his client could see Slager chase after Scott but did not see him get shot, Peper said. 'As they turned the corner, he wasn't able to see anything that occurred,' he said. And while his client heard the Taser followed by the gunshots, 'he doesn't recall the timing or how many seconds between it. All that's a bit foggy', he said. Peper said his client has also given a statement to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. Family members said earlier that two were headed to an auto parts store at the time of the shooting. Peper said they may have had errands planned but his client said they were eventually heading to Scott's house. He said his client has asked for privacy so he can deal with the death of his friend. Saying goodbye: Pallbearers walk Scott's casket to his grave for his burial service on Saturday . Sadness: His heartbroken mother, Judy, is pictured leaving her son's funeral in Charleston last weekend . Fight: Activist Cornel West (center) joins protesters against police violence in Manhattan on April 14 . 'He is torn up. He is a mess,' Peper added to ABC News. 'He hasn't been able to talk to anybody about this.' The father-of-four's death sparked a nationwide debate about police brutality and bias against black people after the witness' video contradicted the police account of the event. Slager, 33, had said that he felt 'threatened' by Scott during a confrontation over his Taser, but the footage revealed the civilian running away before he was shot. Scott was laid to rest last weekend. His casket was draped in an American flag and accompanied by his distraught mother, Judy. Slager has been later charged with murder and fired from the police department. He has yet to enter a plea.","Scott was driving Pierre Fulton back to his house after taking him to a nearby church to collect a bag of vegetables on April 4 .

"A family faces an anxious wait after being told all four of them could get leukaemia. Rachel Simpson, 15, was diagnosed last year with a one-in-a-million genetic condition which doctors say will eventually give her cancer if untreated. The rest of the family, from Heysham, near Lancaster, are now waiting on tests which could reveal which of them also have a mutation of the GATA2 gene. The GATA2 gene is important in the production of blood cells, and the disorder means a sufferer's blood count might be low, making them more vulnerable to infection. Alternatively, the blood cells might be abnormal, leading to leukaemia. Rachel Simpson, 15, has a one-in-a-million genetic condition which doctors say will eventually give her cancer if untreated. The rest of her family (her mother, Donna, father Derek and brother Steven are pictured) are now waiting on tests which could reveal who else has the faulty gene . Miss Simpson's mother Donna, who works as an artisan cake maker, said the rest of the family will find out their fate in the next few weeks. And despite the family fears, her daughter had taken the news as best she could. She said: 'Getting a diagnosis like that, it's a bit mixed. As a parent your feel like your insides have been ripped out, you've got to be brave. 'But there's also relief that we know what's wrong so she can deal with it. 'She's been absolutely amazing, we've not had any tears, nothing, she's ever so matter of fact about it, she understands all the consequences, they explained it all, and she's been so mature.' She explained her daughter's diagnosis came after years of illness. 'She's been getting ill for the last two or three years - she kept getting pneumonia and cellulitis; any infection around she just seems to get.' Baffled, doctors ran blood tests - which revealed she had a mutation of the GATA2 gene. Mrs Simpson said: 'The rest of us have had our fair share of problems, but no more than anybody else. 'We're just waiting for the tests to come back to see if we have the mutation.' Miss Simpson suffers from a mutation of the GATA2 gene. This is important in the production of blood cells, and the disorder means a sufferer's blood counts might be low, making them more vulnerable to infection. Or, the blood cells might be abnormal, leading to leukaemia . Doctors say the mutation's frequency is less than one in a million - and one member of a family has a 50/50 per cent chance of passing it on . She added that despite the bad news about the mutation, the family were grateful for the testing. 'A few years ago we'd have never found out until Rachel got leukaemia,' she said. 'But now they but now they can predict it, which is amazing. She added: 'God willing, I want my son Steven to be OK. We've already been told he's not a bone marrow match, so Rachel will need to go on the bone marrow register.' Professor Inderjeet Dokal, of St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, is an expert in Rachel's condition. He said: 'This mutation's frequency is less than one in a million, it's a very rare genetic disorder. 'One member of a family has a 50/50 chance of passing it on, but it can also be the first time in the family that the genetic mutation occurs. 'If we assume one of the parents has it, then there's a significant possibility that her brothers and sisters have the defect, although they may not have symptoms.' He added: 'If they have the same defect, they can't be a bone marrow donor. 'The donor has to be both tissue type compatible and also negative for the mutation, so it makes it more difficult to find a suitable donor.'","Rachel Simpson, 15, diagnosed with one-in-a-million genetic condition .

"A stunning quadruple rainbow emerged over Long Island this morning after storms shook the New York City area. The rare formation, which appears to be formed of two double rainbows, appeared over a commuter rail station on Long Island early Tuesday. Amanda Curtis, the founder of a fashion company, snapped the phenomenon while she was waiting for the Long Island Railroad at the Glen Cove station. Scroll down for video . Rare: Commuter Amanda Curtis snapped the quadruple rainbow - made of two pairs next to each other - at the Glen Cove LIRR station outside of New York City . Two vivid, primary rainbows can be seen to the left of the image, while dimmer reflections, which have the order of the colors reversed, appear further to the right. Curits posted the image on Twitter hoping that it would bring her luck - and the picture was promptly shared hundreds of times. Reliving the moment in an interview with the Weather Channel, Curtis said: 'I was waiting for my commuter train into NYC and I was outside on the Glen Cove station platform and saw two double rainbows - and was just absolutely blown away by it. Good spot: Commuter Amanda Curtis, who founded fashion company Nineteenth Amendment, took the picture on her way to work Tuesday . 'I decided to take the opportunity to snap to picture to use for later inspiration.' She said that the image was taken in a split second while her train was coming in to the station. Curits said: 'I was outside and my train was coming - so I think I'm good under pressure and just decided to snap it and then run after the train.'

"Her brother-in-law has led a personal crusade against poaching and protecting vulnerable wildlife. So Pippa Middleton’s decision to enjoy a plate of whale meat on holiday may have been rather difficult for Prince William to swallow. The 31-year-old, who styles herself as a food and lifestyle writer, has told of eating Minke whale – even though it is largely banned worldwide. She boasted of tucking into the delicacy in Norway, to the horror of environmental campaigners who say she is helping promote an ‘unimaginably cruel’ trade. Scroll down for video . Pippa Middleton has been slammed for ‘promoting the cruel and unnecessary whaling industry’. She's pictured here at the 2014 GQ Men Of The Year awards in London . In a gushing newspaper feature, the Duchess of Cambridge’s younger sister described how the smoked meat was served in a ‘wonderfully convivial atmosphere’ at the Juvet Landscape Hotel in north-west Norway. Tucking into a starter prepared carpaccio-style – raw and very thinly sliced – she wrote: ‘We dined on smoked whale carpaccio (which tastes similar to smoked salmon but looks more like venison carpaccio).’ Ms Middleton said that she ate whale carpaccio in a 'convivial atmosphere on a large communal table' Earlier she had enjoyed a steam bath and rubbed ice on her body in a ‘snow spa’ at the upmarket hotel, where she spent the night in a £170-a-night ‘designer pod’. The hunting and importation of whale meat is banned in Britain, as it is in most parts of the world, by both the International Whaling Commission and by the international wildlife convention CITES. But Norway – as well as Japan and Iceland – has exploited legal loopholes that allow it to opt out of regulations. Last year it killed around 730 Minke whales, the highest number since it broke the moratorium on commercial whaling in 1993. Campaigners have long called for a crackdown, arguing the hunting process is ‘unimaginably cruel and inhumane’. The socialite, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said that she ate whale at the £123-a-night Juvet Landscape Hotel (pictured) Ms Middleton said that the dinner was cooked by Knut, the hotel’s owner. The Duchess of Cambridge's sister said that the establishment was an 'architectural gem' Pippa Middleton would be breaking British law if she had tucked into the whale meat in the UK. Britain has signed up to the International Whaling Commission, which makes it illegal to import or eat whale meat in this country. Whaling is also prohibited under EU law, but Norway is not a member of the EU. Last season, 731 minke whales were killed in Norway off the country’s northern coasts. The whaling season runs from April to August, when they are hunted from boats using grenade-propelled harpoons, which are shot from cannons into the whale’s chest. In the 1960s and 70s whale meat was commonly served in Norwegian school canteens and as part of military rations. It then fell out of favour, but has recently been adopted as a gourmet food trend. Fish market manager Marius Tvethaug said: ‘Smoked whale is one of the oldest ways to keep food for a long time. And we’ve been catching whale since the Stone Age. I would say it’s kind of back to our roots.’ Even with modern harpoons powered by explosives, the mammals often died a ‘slow and painful’ death. Critics said Miss Middleton’s decision to eat whale meat was at odds with the stance taken by Prince William – even though he too has been attacked for continuing to hunt wild game. She has also been photographed hunting in the past. Vanessa Williams-Grey, of Whale and Dolphin Conservation, said: ‘It might have been better for Pippa to take a whale watch trip in Norway. She might then have thought twice about condoning and indeed, promoting, this cruel and unnecessary trade.’ Philip Mansbridge, UK director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said she was ‘unwittingly setting a bad example’ that may encourage other tourists. A spokesman for Miss Middleton, who travelled on the junket for the Daily Telegraph, refused to comment last night. But Knut Slinning, owner of Juvet Landscape Hotel, said he had no plans to stop serving whale meat because it has been eaten for ‘many hundreds of years’. However, Siri Martinsen, of Norway’s animals rights group NOAH, said Miss Middleton has a ‘special responsibility’ not to support animal cruelty. Last year 731 minke whales suffered an agonising death at the hand of Norwegian whalers, according to WDC. Pictured is a minke whale on the deck of a Japanese vessel . Three Greenpeace inflatables  interrupt whaling on board the Norwegian whaling vessel Kato in the Southern whaling grounds in the North Sea .

"David Cameron has been secretly using hair dye to turn back the years Nigel Farage suggested today. In a dig at the Prime Minister, the Ukip leader said that he was ‘jealous’ of how the Tory leader has reversed the greying process while in Downing Street. After clashing at last week’s televised leaders debate, Mr Farage said he had shaken Mr Cameron’s hand and ‘complimented him on his appearance’. Scroll down for video . David Cameron - who has been accused of trying to hide his bald spot - has been secretly using hair dye to turn back the years, Nigel Farage suggested today . He added: ‘Any man who can reverse the greying process I’m jealous of. ‘I’m going to have a go myself, it’s a wonderful thing. He’s also lost a lot of weight, he’s going out jogging.’ Asked if he thought Mr Cameron was too vain, Mr Farage said: ‘To a certain extent they all are. Some people it worries to death and others really don’t worry too much.’ Mr Cameron, 48, has previously been accused of visiting stylists and even trichologists to keep his hair looking youthful. In 2011, Downing Street was forced to deny claims Mr Cameron was fighting the relentless process with unnatural help after his grey hairs looked less prominent, . ‘I promise you he has not dyed his hair,’ a spokesman said. ‘The Prime Minister has other things to think about, he’s just not like that.’ Mr Farage said he was ‘jealous’ of how the Tory leader has reversed the greying process while in Downing Street .

'I've had a few grey hairs and I expect I'll get a few more, whatever happens. This is a relentless process,' he said.

"Police are believed to have identified one of the men behind the jewel heist in Hatton Garden, as it was revealed the gang could have been inspired by similar robberies in Los Angeles in the 1980s. Officers from Scotland Yard's Flying Squad released images of three  suspects on Saturday, but refused to release a picture of the supposed ringleader, likely because he has already been identified. Meanwhile criminologist Richard Hoskins said he has identified 'startling similarities' between the Hatton Garden raid and novel Black Echo, by Michael Connelly. Scroll down for video . Police are believed to have identified one of the Hatton Garden raiders after releasing CCTV images of the gang as they raided the bank vault over the Easter bank holiday . Officers released images of three of the men, but refused to release an images of the supposed ringleader, which is believed to be because he has already been identified . The novel was based on real-life bank robbers dubbed 'The Hole In The Ground Gang' who struck three vaults in LA in 1986 and 1987, and were never caught. In the 1986 robbery, the gang tunneled into a bank vault over a long weekend, triggering alarms on the Friday that were not investigated, before raiding safety deposit boxes stored inside the vaults. It was not until the week following the raids that police were called and discovered the robbers had dug into the vault using heavy machinery, in very similar circumstances to the Hatton Garden raid. Criminologist Richard Hoskins noticed 'striking similarities' between the Hatton Garden raid and crime novel Black Echo, which itself is based on two jewel heists in LA in the 1980s . Mr Hoskins, who also wrote murder novel The Boy in the River, told MailOnline: 'There is obviously a lot we don't know about the Hatton Garden heist, but on the surface they look very similar. 'I think that when the raiders were planning their heist they must have read this book, or researched the robberies in LA. 'While the robbery is obviously terrible for the victims, I think everyone can agree that this was a very smart operation, and Black Echo sets out a very smart way to rob a vault. 'The timeline fits almost exactly, right down to the alarm being set off on a Friday and the break in being discovered on a Tuesday.' The Hole In The Ground Gang first struck in 1986, when they tunneled underneath a First Interstate Bank located along famous Sunset Boulevard near Hollywood, in LA. The gang, believed to number around four or five, made a hole in the wall of a storm drain underneath LA's streets, before tunneling 100ft through the dirt, emerging underneath the bank vault. They then used concrete drills and saws to cut a 20ft-by-25ft hole in the floor of the vault, before clambering through and ransacking the safety deposit boxes. In total they got away with $270,000 in cash, along with the contents of 36 deposit boxes, worth up to $2.5million. One box contained a sketch of a young girl by Henri Matisse. The crew had stashed quadbikes underground for a quick escape, but the raid was in fact not discovered until the start of the following week when staff arrived to find the vault ransacked. Police then discovered the tunnel, littered with 'an enormous number' of polystyrene coffee cups, and surmised that the raiders were probably sewer or construction workers who had decided to turn their skills to a sinister new use. Nobody was ever traced for the crime, and in 1987 the same group struck again, this time at a Bank of America in another LA neighbourhood. In both Hatton Garden and the LA raids, the gangs bored into vaults using heavy drills (pictured), broke in over a long weekend, set off an alarm on the Friday that wasn't checked out, and raided safety deposit boxes . The LA raiders became known as the Hole In The Ground Gang, and Mr Hoskins believes the group who raided Hatton Garden (picutred) must have known about them, or read the book inspired by them . Again, the group had used heavy tools to cut their way into a bank vault over the course of a weekend, and again they had set off an alarm on their way in. However, on this occasion police did respond, and they were forced to flee with just $89,000 and without cracking a single safety deposit box. It was only afterwards the officers discovered another tunnel underneath Union Federal Savings and Loan in Beverly Hills, suggesting the gang were attempting to hit two vaults at once. Mr Connelly told The Times: 'The Black Echo was a fictionalised account of a bank heist that occurred in LA in September 1987. It was never solved.' In the Hatton Garden raid, the Met Police have said the raiders broke into the building on the second floor, disabling the lift before lowering themselves down the shaft and breaking into the basement. The men then climbed back up to the ground floor to let other gang members in through a side entrance, before all making their way to the vaults where they drilled their way inside. The raiders then broke into 72 safety deposit boxes, before making their getaway in a white Ford Transit van parked outside. The diamond-tipped drills were taken from a building site in Fetter Lane, an eight minute walk from Hatton Garden, and nobody was ever arrested. Police are probing the thefts of several drills in the months before the raid, including two Hilti drills that were taken near Hatton Garden. DCI Paul Johnson (pictured) has previously said Hilti drills were used in the raid . City of London Police also confirmed today that they have passed information to Scotland Yard about the theft of two Hilti drills, the same devices used in the Hatton Garden raid, in December last year. In another development, The Sun has revealed that £80,000 worth of diamond tipped drills were stolen from another site in South London in November, using a van similar to that at Hatton Garden. Andrew Royce, of Elmcrest Diamond Drilling, revealed that the equipment could easily be used to cut into a vault, as his firm is often tasked with converting former banks into hotels and housing. CCTV from the scene reveals that a white Transit Van parked outside his business for two minutes in November last year before two hooded men are seen walking past .","Officers thought to have identified supposed ringleader of jewel thieves .

"The 73-year-old reserve deputy who mistakenly pulled out his gun instead of a Taser and shot dead a fleeing suspect says the mix-up could have happened to anyone. Robert Bates, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, spoke at length about the deadly incident for the first time on the Today show on Friday, where he was flanked by his lawyer and family members. He also took the opportunity to apologize to the family of the man he killed in the April 2 incident. 'First and foremost let me apologize to the family of Eric Harris,' he said as he became emotional. 'I rate this as number one on my list of things in my life that I regret... I still can't believe it happened.' Scroll down for videos . Apology: Robert Bates became emotional as he apologized to the family of the man he shot dead during a botched sting operation on April 2. The reserve deputy appeared on the Today show on Friday . The interview comes just days after Bates turned himself in to face charges of second-degree manslaughter. He was released after posting a $25,000 bond. On the Today show, he recalled how he had been in his car several blocks away when Harris, 44, ran towards him amid a botched undercover gun-sale operation. Video of the incident shows Bates chasing after the man. In an attempt to subdue him, Bates went to grab his Taser, but was unaware he had actually pulled out his gun instead. In the video, Bates can be heard shouting 'Taser! Taser!' When the gunshot goes off, he says: 'I shot him. I'm sorry.' The fatally-wounded man can be heard daying: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man' before adding: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath!' On the Today show, Bates said he was immediately hit by shock when the gun went off. Mix up: While on the Today show, he showed where he keeps his Taser (left) compared to where he keeps his gun (right). He said that there have previously been cases of officers confusing the position of the two . Support: He appeared on the Today show on Friday flanked by family members and his lawyer, right . 'Oh my god, what has happened?' he recalled thinking. 'This was not an intentional thing. I had no desire to ever take anyone's life.' He said that the shock remains with him and he is unable to sleep or concentrate. Bates also stood up and demonstrated where he keeps his Taser on his body - slightly below his chest - compared to where he keeps his gun - on his lower right-hand side near his pants pocket. Today show host Matt Lauer asked him how he could make the mistake, when the two pieces of equipment are kept so far away from each other on the body. 'This has happened a number of times around the country, I have read about it in the past,' Bates responded. 'I thought to myself after reading several cases, ""I don't understand how this can happen"". You must believe me - it can happen to anyone.' Shot dead: Eric Harris, who is pictured with his son Aidan, was killed in the incident on April 2 . Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' The interview follows reports that Bates, a millionaire insurance broker, had been allowed to 'play cop' after he donated pricey equipment to the department - a claim he called 'unbelievably unfair'. Bates, who is among several well-to-do Tulsa residents who moonlight as reserve deputies, has purchased five vehicles for the police force. He also dismissed recent reports in the Tulsa World that he had not completed the proper hours of training, saying it is 'absolutely the truth' that he had paperwork to show he had completed it. His lawyer added that the report was largely based on claims made by a man who was terminated from the department seven years ago, at which point Bates had only been there a few months. Bates is classified by the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office as an 'advanced reserve'. This means that he went through 480 hours training of the 'Field Training Officer' or FTO. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he had previously attended a five-day homicide school in Dallas and also received 'active shooter response training' with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in Arizona. He also claims to have been involved in 'at least 100 other' assignments. Charged: Harris (pictured left) died from his injuries and Bates (right in his mug shot) has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. He faces four years in prison if he is convicted . Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . But the sources who spoke to Tulsa World claimed that the reserve deputy was not properly trained to be an armed deputy, despite Sheriff Stanley Glanz saying otherwise. Indeed, Sheriff Glanz and Bates' own legal team have repeatedly produced records which they claim prove he was an 'advanced reserve' and had undergone 480 hours training. However, when asked to produced proof that Bates was certified to use three weapons, including the revolver he fired at Harris, the Sheriff's Office say they have been unable to find the paperwork. Bates faces four years in prison if convicted.

"When most think of Ford, its ubiquitous Fiesta and Focus spring to mind. But in a bid to shed its image as the home of the mundane run-around, the company has launched its very own supercar. With the first models already shipped to China, the  GT, will be unrolled across Europe next year. While Ford has refused to officially confirm its price, bosses have indicated it will run alongside the £260,000 Lamborghini Aventador. To herald its launch, the company's design team have created a stunning light sculpture which showcases how they came about creating the prototype. Ford showcased its £260,000 GT in a stunning light installation in the heart of Milan as the first models are shipped to China . The light sculpture was unveiled in the  Piazza de Fidele on Tuesday as part of Milan Design Week . Planted in Milan's Piazza de Fidele, it walked through the steps of rendering to give insight into the car's conception. In the heart of one of the world's most design-savvy cities, many were surprised to learn the piece had been produced by car designers and engineers, said bosses. '(Having an artwork) is something new for us but really it combined everything that we do everyday,' said Moray Callum, Ford's Vice President of design. 'The model making, the technology - all of that was done in house so it's just taking what we do and presenting it in a different way.' 'We, generally, are a car company that talks to car guys but we wanted to reach a wider audience. 'We've had people approaching the installation and asking ""this is Ford?!"" which is just great. 'People were shocked that we were doing this and that's what we wanted to hear.' Alongside the modern artwork, Ford has released some of the first impressions of what the GTs interior will look like. The artwork was composed by Ford designers who worked on the concept for the £260,000 GT . The interactive installation was placed in Milan's Piazza de Fidele where it remained throughout design week . With its exterior a combination of aluminium and carbon-fibre, the compact two-seater has all the hallmarks of its ultra-sleek competitors. And earmarked at around the same price as the Lamborghini Aventador, the GT is a far cry from the much-loved models which keeps the company afloat. But despite a drive towards luxury, bosses insist the company is not trying to breakaway from its most reliable consumer. 'As long as I'm around, the mum on the school run will remain important - but design is important for her too,' added Mr Callum. Speaking at Milan's Salone de Mobile - an annual showcase of the world's leading furniture and light designers - he continued: 'Generally we are a car company that talks to car guys but we want to reach a wider audience. 'Design has always been important but we're finding you need to expand your audience.' The model was showcased for the first time at the International Auto Show in Detroit earlier this year (above) The car has up-swinging doors and 600 horsepower. It was unveiled in January in Detroit to a rapturous reception . The first images of the interior of the Ford GT have been revealed after 100 of the supercars were shipped to China . While the vehicle won't reach European markets until next year, bosses say they have been 'pleased' with the reaction the car . While the GT is priced out of most's grasp, another of its most advanced vehicles could be brought to the masses, he added. Ford's version of a driverless car is in the final stages of production with just safety legislation and measure standing between it and the open road. 'We have autonomous cars that we've been working on for the past 20 years in Detroit. A lot of the technology is there for about 90 per cent of driving,' added Mr Callum. 'What we're working on now is that extra 10 per cent which will take into account whether there are road works or if there's been an accident (and it's not registered).'","Ford unveiled its GT earlier this year to the surprise of industry experts .

"A filmmaker, whose older sister has Down syndrome, is confronting the misuse of the word 'retarded' and exploring the history of how the medical term has evolved into a hateful insult in her upcoming documentary, which aims to change the way people think, speak and act. Amanda Lukoff, from Arlington, Virginia, teamed up with her husband Danny Egan for their film The R-Word, which is in pre-production while they try to raise $200,000 for the documentary on the crowdsourcing website IndieGoGo. The director and producer, who was inspired to create the movie by her sister Gabrielle, has already signed on cast members including Scrubs actor John C. McGinley and Glee actress Lauren Potter, who has Down syndrome. 'To full understand how and why the R-word came to be, we have to start at the beginning, so I am setting out on a journey to find out how, when and why the R-word became a part of popular culture,' Amanda says in the trailer for the documentary. Scroll down for video . Tight-knit: Amanda Lukoff (left), pictured with her siblings, was inspired to create her documentary The R-Word after growing up with her sister Gabrielle (center), who was born with Down syndrome . Amanda, who plans on starting principal photography this month, has already raised nearly $25,000 since starting the campaign in March. Although she still has 25 days to reach her goal, she notes on the page that she will make the documentary whether or not she meets her fundraising target of $200,000. In the preview clip, Amanda explains that, while she was growing up, she knew her sister Gabrielle 'was different, even special' because of her intellectual disability. She adds that her sister's refusal to let her Down syndrome define her has been a source of inspiration for her in her own life. 'I have also realized that everyone is not as sensitive to my sister's difference as I am,' she says. Sisterly support: Amanda and Gabrielle can be seen speaking at a podium during a private event . Celebration: Gabrielle was photographed happily dancing at Amanda's wedding to her now husband Danny Egan . After years of being confronted with the misuse of the word 'retarded' when she was 'on the bus and at school, at work and parties, on TV and in movies, in music and books, and most recently all over social media' Amanda says she realized that other people were 'probably experiencing the same thing'. 'I wanted to know how a term once used as a medical description for individuals with intellectual disabilities became a derogatory word used to put people down,' she says. With her film, Amanda is looking to see if the word 'transcends American society' and will explore the lasting effects it has on people with intellectual disabilities, as well as their friends and families. Spreading the word: Amanda can be seen giving a presentation about her documentary . Think first: Amanda's says she wants to change the way people speak . Amanda explains that she hopes to empower people and also encourage others to think before they speak. 'We want to show people that the word [retarded] actually has a big impact when we use it,' she tells The Mighty. 'It’s not a light-hearted joke that some people believe it to be.' The money Amanda receives in donations will go towards filming, travel, animation and editing, among other things. But the amount of money she raises will only determine how quickly the documentary will be created. 'The film will be made no matter what,' she says.","Amanda Lukoff, from Arlington, Virginia, teamed up with her husband Danny Egan for their film The R-Word .

"A woman was reportedly spotted threatening people with 'a dildo in each hand' during an altercation outside a Grafton pub. An eye-witnesses said a fight broke out inside Roches Family Hotel late Friday night before it spilled out onto Victoria Road. Nick Weller told the Daily Examiner he initially saw two girls brawling on the streets. A woman was reportedly spotted threatening people with 'a dildo in each hand' during an altercation outside Roches Family Hotel in Grafton . 'There were two girls having an altercation out the front after the hotel closed,' he said. 'There was definitely some hair pulling going on and a couple of girls ended up on the ground.' The altercation took an unusual turn when Mr Weller and other onlookers spotted a woman approaching the scene, armed with two rubber sex toys. 'Out of nowhere this other woman joined the fray with a dildo in each hand,' Mr Weller said. 'She was swinging them about in the air threatening people who were standing around. 'It was just so weird to watch. My friends and I had no idea what was going on. We tried talking to her but she was seriously out of it at that stage.' Grafton Police confirmed they attended the scene however no one made a formal complaint about the woman or her strange choice of weaponry . He described the woman as Caucasian, of slight build, aged in her late 20's or early 30's. Mr Weller said there were at least five or six girls fighting on the streets before police arrived. 'There was 20 or 30 people standing around it trying to break it up or having their own little altercations alongside. 'As soon as the cops arrived everybody sort of dropped their drinks and cleared off.' Grafton Police confirmed they attended the scene however no one made a formal complaint about the woman or her strange choice of weaponry. A spokesperson from Roches Family Hotel denied there was a fight outside the venue, instead claiming it was 'just a heated discussion between a couple of people that spilled on to the street'. 'It was cleared up pretty quickly as soon as the police arrived on scene,' they told the Examiner.","A fight took an unusual turn outside a Grafton pub late Friday night .

"A young father who died in a paragliding accident on Monday afternoon posted pictures of his view from the sky just hours before he lost control of his powered paramotor. Kyle Wittstock, 22, posted photos from the air with the caption 'Guess where I am?', showing the beach and water far below his dangling feet. The paraglider was swept into a garage door of a house on Linksman Street in Yanchep, Perth, by a strong wind at approximately 3.30pm on Monday afternoon. Kyle Wittstock, 22, died on Monday afternoon after his paraglider crashed into a garage door . Mr Wittstock was taken to Joondalup Hospital by emergency services and was pronounced dead shortly after arrival, reported 9news. The 22-year-old left behind a fiance and a nine-week-old daughter, who he referred to as his 'little lion cub' in Facebook posts. 'So lucky to have a family like mine!!!

"Sean Donohoe, 30, from Wilnecote, Tamworth, plundered a pensioner's life savings, blowing £28,500 on shopping sprees and lavish meals out . A crooked builder befriended a widowed pensioner so he could fritter away her £28,500 life savings on shopping sprees and lavish meals out. Sean Donohoe, 30, from Wilnecote, Tamworth, plundered the elderly woman's accounts before spending tens of thousands of pounds on trips to the Snowdome and in shops such as Argos and HMV. He even persuaded his victim to change her will so he could reap the benefits, before secretly taking out two life insurance policies, both of which named him as the beneficiary. The builder has now been jailed for 21 months after admitting charges of fraud and theft. Sentencing him at Birmingham Crown Court, the judge said Donohoe abused the woman's trust in 'every conceivable way'. Judge Francis Laird QC said: 'You befriended her, you became a close friend and confidante. Because of your behaviour towards her she absolutely trusted you with her financial affairs. 'You abused that trust. You did so in every conceivable way. She effectively handed over her money to you. You were not a financial advisor. 'However she was an elderly lady, a widow, alone and highly vulnerable to a dishonest individual such as yourself.' The court was told how Donohoe had first befriended the woman when he carried out work on her property in Tyseley in 2007. By January 2011, he had started controlling the woman's finances. During that time, he applied for credit cards in her name and also ran up huge debts. The court heard how the victim also changed her will twice during Donohoe's two-year scam, leaving everything to the defendant. But the widow was unaware that Donohoe had taken out the life insurance policies. Lal Amarasinghe, prosecuting, said Donohoe used the money on trips to the Snowdome as well as on meals and at shops. But Department of Work and Pensions checks soon discovered that the woman's accounts were overdrawn, prompting social services to become involved. A judge at Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) said Donohoe abused the woman's trust 'in every conceivable way'. The builder has now been jailed for 21 months, after admitting theft and fraud . It led to Donohoe being arrested. Police found him in possession of four credit cards, as well as a raft of documentation, in the widow's name. In a statement after the case, the victim said: 'I thought he was a good person but I was wrong. As a result of what Sean did to me I was left with no money and worried about paying my bills months after. I am still shocked and upset that he stole thousands of pounds.' Nicholas Berry, defending, said Donohoe was suffering from anxiety and depression after the break-up of a previous relationship and had got into a financial troubles through gambling. 'He was spiralling into debt and owed his father a lot of money. At that time, quite clearly, he saw the opportunity to fleece the victim in an appalling manner,' he said.","Sean Donohoe, 30, from Wilnecote, Tamworth, befriended woman in 2007 .

"She was among the first Britons to join the terrorists of Islamic State and regularly takes to Twitter to issue violent threats, including one in which she spoke of her wish to become the first woman to behead a Westerner. But despite all that, Khadijah Dare's heartbroken mother Victoria has used her first ever interview to call upon her daughter to return and says she wants her only child in her life. Mrs Dare,  from Lewisham in South London, also revealed that her daughter had been an equally devout Christian as a child but turned to Islam while at college. Scroll down for video . Plea: The mother of jihadi bride Khadijah Dare (pictured) has issued a plea for her to return home . 'She loved church,' said Mrs Dare in an interview due to be screened tonight as part of a BBC documentary. 'She had a Bible, she read the Bible. She would sit there and pray and pray and pray.' Dare, who was born in Nigeria but emigrated to the UK as a child, was originally christened Grace but, says her mother, the 22-year-old changed it after she began attending services at the Lewisham Islamic Centre - a mosque also linked to the Lee Rigby killers. 'When she became Muslim, I would get these phone calls saying, ""Can I speak to Khadijah?"" I said to her, what's that about? She says, ""Oh, that's my name"". It was only the mosque people who called her Khadijah. I don't call her that.' Now living in Syria, Dare, who married a Swedish IS terrorist calling himself Abu Bakr almost as soon as she arrived, has reportedly been widowed. Threats: Dare, who is in Syria, is notorious for threatening to become the first woman to behead a Westerner . Radicalised: Aqsa Mahmood, who calls herself Umm Layth, also appears on BBC2's Britain's Jihadi Brides . Exposed: Mahmood's identity was exposed following a MailOnline investigation . Nevertheless, she continues to spread IS propaganda online and has been accused of encouraging other young women to travel to the Middle East, much like fellow British jihadi bride Umm Layth. Umm Layth, who was unmasked as a Glaswegian teenager named Aqsa Mahmood last year following a MailOnline investigation, has even offered advice to would-be jihadis on what clothes to bring and what they can expect from life with IS. But her family's lawyer, who appears on BBC documentary Britain's Jihadi Brides alongside Mrs Dare and Renu Begum, sister of one of the three missing Bethnal Green schoolgirls, says the reality is very different. 'There's nothing loving about them and there's nothing religious about them because they are ripping the heart out of our communities,' says Aamer Anwar. 'They are like paedophiles. They are groomers. They are getting their claws into people and ripping them away from the families who love and care about them.' Mahmood, who, say her family, was once a 'kind, caring individual' and a 'loving young woman', is now helping to radicalise would-be jihadi brides herself, as well is issuing threats and encouraging Muslims to take up arms. 'Follow the examples of your brothers from Woolwich, Texas and Boston,' read a tweet posted last summer. 'If you cannot make it to the battlefield, then bring the battlefield to yourself.' Another blog post claimed that within two generations, the world would be under the heel of an 'Islamic Empire'. 'Know this Cameron and Obama, your countries will be destroyed and your kuffar [non believers] beneath our feet,' wrote the 20-year-old. 'If not you, then your children or your grandchildren. This Islamic Empire will be known and feared worldwide and we shall follow none other than the law of the one and only Allah. Gone: One of the older female recruits is Kent benefits claimant Sally Jones, 45 . Recruiter: Now using the name Sakinah Hussain, she was caught trying to recruit jihadi brides last autumn . Widowed: Zahra Halane (pictured) and her sister Salma have both been widowed since joining IS . 'This is a war against Islam and it shall be known that you're with them or with us. So pick a side.' Dare and Mahmood are among the 22 British women known to be in Syria but police believe there could be another 40 whose disappearances have not been reported. Those who are there include Zahra and Salma Halane, the Manchester teenagers who have become known as 'the Terror Twins' and 45-year-old Sally Jones, a benefits claimant from Kent who now goes under the name of Sakinah Hussain. 'What they fail to understand is that they've been brainwashed by someone's ideology which is not the same as Islam,' says former radicaliser Yasmin Mulbocus. 'These women need to wake up. They need to discover the real sisterhood of Islam. They need to start questioning. They are brainwashed so bad, they've lost their own soul.' Anwar agrees. 'The best way to defeat radicalisation is to find the ex-radicals and find out what changed them. 'You're [would-be jihadi brides] told that you are going to the Gates of Paradise but when you get to Syria you will find out what Hell is really all about. Because it's there. It's happening now.' As for Dare, she says she will never return home, despite her mother's pleas. 'I want you back, that's what I said [to her],' says Mrs Dare. 'I want you back in my life. She is the only child that I have and the Devil took her away from my life.'","Grace Dare, who now uses the name Khadijah, is with ISIS in Syria .

"These are the sneering faces of some of the 39 criminals currently on the run from a notorious open prison. Among their number are two murderers, as well as drug dealers and fraudsters. Some  have been awol from Ford Open Prison for  as long as 10 years, according to information only now released by the Ministry of Justice. One of the escapees from the 500-inmate jail, is violent killer Robert Donovan, 57. His disappearance only emerged last year, four years after he had walked out of the prison in Arundel, Sussex. AWOL: Murderer Robert Donovan, 57, left,  is considered so dangerous that the public have been advised not to approach him. He disappeared from Ford in 2010, but it took the police four years to alert the public. Fellow murderer Derek Passmore, right, escaped in 2013 after being jailed for beating a disabled man to death in 1996 . Notorious: Ford Open Prison in Arundel, Sussex, was revealed to have the worst record for prison escapes . Murderer Derek Passmore, who beat to death a disabled man in 1996, is still at large after failing to return from day release in June 2013, despite a public appeal a month after his escape. Carer Tom Zolynski stole £10,000 from a pensioner he was supposed to be helping and was jailed for two years in May 2010, but left the prison without permission later that year and has yet to be caught. Goran Durdevic was jailed for 15 months in 2005, at age 28, for using a so-called 'Lebanese loop' to steal a man's credit card at a cash machine. He left the prison without permission in February 2006. In June last year Ford, near Arundel, was revealed to have the worst record for inmates vanishing, with a total of 89 prisoners on the run, dating back to one who had gone missing in the early 1960s. The Ministry of Justice has now responded to a Freedom of Information request and finally revealed the names of 29 missing since 2004 and outline details of a further ten. They include those who failed to return from temporary release and those who simply walked out without permission, known as 'absconds'. Among those who failed to return after a temporary release in June 2010 is 57-year-old Robert Donovan, who was convicted of stabbing a West End theatre manager to death. Police considered him so dangerous that he should not be approached by the public, but not a single appeal was made for help catching him until June last year. Donovan, who was jailed indefinitely at the Old Bailey in December 1974, had been in open conditions for less than a year when he absconded. Leacroft Wallace, left, vanished in 2011, he was jailed for possessing drugs with intent and Malek Riahi, right, was sent to prison for deception offences. He has not been seen since 2006 . Abid Butt, left, was inside for possession drugs with intent and went on the run in 2006 and Ion Popescu, right, was convicted of going equipped for theft. He escaped in 2009 . John Wilson, left, was jailed for alcohol related offences and has been missing since 2010. Jose Praga-Perdomo, right, was jailed for the importing drugs . Arben Nuredini, left, who disappeared in January was jailed for wounding with intent and Mokrane Mahdid, right, who vanished in 2006, was jailed for false instruments . James Demorges, left, who was inside for fraud, disappeared six years ago and Alvin Harris, right,  jailed for importing drugs, has been missing for 10 years. He was 17 when he and his brother Patrick, 19, and David Baillie, 17, robbed and killed Palladium stage manager Edwin Thornley, who was stabbed in the neck with a flick-knife on Hungerford Bridge over the Thames. All three youths admitted robbing him. Robert Donovan was convicted of murder and the other two were convicted of manslaughter and jailed for up to six years. As well as the 25 pictured, the Ministry of Justice named five more men it says are on the run but which Sussex Police, who release the pictures, said were not on its list of missing inmates. Those include fraudster Oluwasegun Adekule, who was jailed in 2007 for his key role in a gang of fraudsters who reportedly stole £2.4 million from clients of Halifax, HSBC and Barclays, including trying to defraud BBC journalist Rageh Omar. He was 26 at the time he absconded in September 2008. Manuel Guio-Ruiz, left, disappeared in 2004 while serving a sentence for drug possession with intent and Tom Zolynski, right, vanished in 2010 after being jailed for theft. He was a carer who stole £10,000 from a pensioner he was looking after . Samuel Rutherford, left, has not been seen for nine years after disappearing while serving his sentence for Importing drugs and Marco Napolitano, right, disappeared in 2006. He was jailed for theft . Thief Goran Durdevic, left, went awol from Ford in 2006 and drug smuggler Oyewale Owolodun, right, vanished the year earlier . Gary Robinson, left, is a drug smuggler, who disappeared eight years ago and Michael Bronson is a drug dealer, who vanished in 2009 . It was 2005 when Oweh Ogbonna, left,  jailed for drug smuggling disappeared and fraudster Ismail Hasko, right,  went on the run in 2010 . Burglar Steven Fortnam, left, disappeared in 2011 and drug dealer Sylvian Monjal, right, went missing six years earlier . Richard John Agar was convicted of unlawfully importing or exporting drugs in 2007, and failed to return from temporary release in 2009, aged 45. It was not his first offence: he lost an appeal in 2000 against a previous conviction for amphetamine supply in Edinburgh. Drug dealer John Umego-Castano had his sentence for supplying Class A drugs cut from 15 years to 13 years in 2006 after the Court of Appeal agreed the amount of drugs involved was not enough to warrant such a harsh sentence. Yet in 2009, aged 41, he failed to return from temporary release, and is still at large. The other two are Sedan Asan, who was convicted of deception and absconded from the prison in 2006, at age 28, and Johnny Watson, who was convicted of supplying drugs and, age 39, also walked out without permission in 2006. Victor Lloyd Mcfarlane, escaped from Ford 10 years ago, when he was serving a sentence for supplying drug . A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Prisoners who abscond, fail to return or commit crime while on release will be sent back to closed prisons.' He added: 'Temporary release can be an important part of rehabilitating offenders but not at the cost of public protection.' Open prisons like Ford are used for prisoners who are trusted to serve their sentences with minimal supervision and perimeter security and are not locked up in prison cells. Prisoners may be allowed to take up employment while serving their sentence and leave the site at designated times to go to their job. The men at Ford get television at 50p per week, hobbies kits and PlayStation. But although they are deemed trustworthy enough not to be locked up in a cell, in June 2014, Ford was revealed to have the worst record for fugitive inmates, with 89 on the run. Sussex Police pledged it was 'determined to find all those still at large'. But at the time it only released the names of those it deemed the greatest risk to the public, saying it could not justify releasing the 'personal information' on the others. Following a Freedom of Information request made in September last year, the MoJ took around six months to respond and did not reveal the names of ten of the 39 prisoners due to 'concerns regarding police investigation and/or risk of harm to the victim'. Glyn Travis, spokesman for the POA trade union for prison workers, today insisted it should not have to take a freedom of information battle to get the names of prisoners on the run. He said: 'The court sentences people to prison because they have lost trust in them. 'So for me, if they walk out of prison, they have broken that trust even further and the public should be made aware that. 'They should say, 'so-and-so has walked out of prison and while we don't consider him a risk to the public, he should be brought back'.' The Ministry of Justice says eligibility for open prisons has now been revised as part of 'significant work' to tighten the system. But Mr Travis said 'major problems' contributing to prisoners running away still needed to be addressed. He added: 'There is constant overcrowding and inappropriate prisoners are being sent to open prison when they obviously pose a serious risk to the public.'","A total of 39 inmates are at large from Ford Open Prison, West Sussex .

"France has joined Italy and Israel in passing laws banning the promotion of extreme thinness in the fashion industry. The health reforms, which include fining agencies employing models with a BMI under 18 and criminalising pro-anorexia web content, have now passed through the upper house of parliament. An analysis of the reforms by Sarah Jackson, a research psychologist at University College London, suggested that censoring images of ultra-thin models may ease their adverse effects on young women, such as concerns about body image and behaviours such as unhealthy eating. But while some have been hailing the legislation as a 'crackdown on anorexia', the laws may be unlikely to have any such effect. The view that anorexia is caused by comparing oneself to catwalk models remains popular. But Rachel Cole-Fletcher,  of Durham University says it is not a lifestyle choice and personality traits are to blame (file photo) Not a lifestyle choice . In Western Europe, around 0.5 per cent of adults are thought to be affected by anorexia nervosa. In around 10 per cent of these cases, the sufferers are men. These figures, however, are likely to be an underestimation. Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness, mostly due to organ failure and suicide. Yet, the illness is often mistaken by many as a lifestyle choice with an external cause. Despite accounts of the disorder pre-dating the fashion industry, the view that anorexia is caused by comparing oneself to a catwalk model remains popular. Likewise, while pro-ana websites insist that anorexia is a commitment, not an illness, they are highly exclusive online communities, created by and for those already showing signs of the illness. The merely curious are not welcome. High levels of perfectionism, a need for organisation and a focus on details are often observed in those with anorexia, studies have shown . Instead, the link between media endorsement of extreme thinness and the development of anorexia is neither simple nor clear. Research mentioned by Ms Jackson did find that women evaluated their bodies more negatively after viewing images of thin models. However, this effect was small and mostly determined by women's pre-existing opinions of their figures – women who were already dissatisfied with their body were most affected. As this effect was only measured at one point in time, the effects of prolonged exposure are not known, but when more images were used there was a tendency for the effect to be smaller. Perhaps, as the authors suggested, these images activated, rather than cultivated, beauty ideals. Whether the effects of media exposure on body dissatisfaction leads to changes in eating behaviour is also unclear. Another study, also cited by Jackson, looked for a link between a person's real-life media exposure and eating disorder symptoms. The results were fairly inconsistent, with some factors – such as body dissatisfaction – only corresponding to some types of media, and others – such as self-worth – showing no relationship. More importantly, the research showed correlation, not causation – it is just as plausible that women already unhappy with their bodies seek out thinness-promoting media more often. After all, if such a simple causal relationship did exist, the pervasiveness of these images in our culture raises the question of why the majority of our population is overweight, rather than underweight. In Western Europe, around 0.5 per cent of adults are thought to be affected by anorexia nervosa, but these figures tend to be underestimated, experts said (file photo) Model ban but no support . Most researchers currently view the cultural value placed on thinness as a 'background risk factor'. Meanwhile, several psychological and biological factors are implicated. High levels of perfectionism, a need for organisation and a focus on details are often observed in those with anorexia. Recent research suggests there is a lower reward response to food in the brain, even after recovery. Some of these factors seem to be influenced by genetic inheritance. Stressful experiences may then influence whether these existing factors then lead to developing the disorder. More than one risk factor will be necessary. So the legislation is likely to have little effect on the prevalence of anorexia in the general population, but it also offers no support to the models themselves. The law requires a medical certificate proving that a model has a BMI of at least 18. This is still underweight, according to the World Health Organisation. Regular weigh-ins have been only vaguely suggested and there's been no mention of an obligation to offer support to a model who fails a weigh-in. While there is some debate over whether models are at a higher risk of developing eating disorders, this career certainly encourages unhealthy behaviour. Thinness of this degree has hugely damaging effects on the internal organs, bones and brain. It can cause obsessiveness and social withdrawal even in psychologically healthy people. France has already lost a high-profile model to anorexia – yet the new laws almost encourage agencies to wash their hands of models who fall ill. Legislation banning models with a BMI under 18 is likely to have little effect on the prevalence of anorexia in the general population, but it also offers no support to the models themselves, experts have argued . In the same way, while pro-ana content is undoubtedly harmful, the new laws punish those who are in need of help. This exclusively punitive approach is likely to drive these sites further undergound. If the measures are enforced – if spot checks continue, weigh-ins aren't cheated and other countries are supportive – they may be a positive move. They may be a first step towards a culture that prioritises health over aesthetics – whether that means a dangerously small or unhealthily large body. Nonetheless, this will mostly benefit the worried well – those who, regrettably, are unhappy with their bodies, but are otherwise unlikely to develop anorexia nervosa. Claiming that these laws address one of the most treatment-resistant mental illnesses is far too optimistic.

"Iona Costello's stepson, George Costello Jr, 45, was staying nearby at the time. He also has a long history of drug arrests (mugshot from April) The stepson of a Long Island mother who went missing with her daughter last month has a long criminal record and was jailed again just days after she disappeared, a report suggests. George Costello Jr is currently in jail in Florida on apparently unrelated charges and has been described by relatives as a 'mixed-up' kid.' Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily were visiting Manhattan when they were last seen on March 30 near their home in the the wealthy seaside village of Greenport. Their car was found in a parking garage on 42nd street in Manhattan, but the pair, who often went into the city for theater and art museums, left no other trace of their whereabouts. Iona's husband died in 2012 from a heart attack, and she is believed to have been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. The New York Daily News have reported Iona's stepson Costello Jr, 45, was visiting Hamptons Bay, New York, at the time, and relatives said he has never got on with the family. He has a long history of drug arrests and is currently in Palm Beach Detention Center following an arrest for a 'domestic dispute' when he returned to Florida. His fiance, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the Daily News  it was a 'weird coincidence', but insists she was with him the whole time. Speaking from the prison, he told the newspaper he was visiting his Hampton Bay home at the time and flew home on April 1, two days after the pair went missing. George Jr, who has at least 10 arrests to his name, according to court records, says he didn't have a close relationship with Iona. He said the last time the pair spoke was at his father and her husband's funeral. 'She's a hardworking lady who loves her horses and takes care of them really well. She's a good mother,' he told the Daily News. Scroll down for video . Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily were visiting Manhattan when they were last seen on March 30 near their home in the the wealthy Long Island village of Greenport . Iona's mother, Diana Malcomson, also insisted George Jr wouldn't want to harm the pair, but said he was a 'mixed-up kid'. Her brother-in-law is also facing a criminal case. John Costello, is  facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York. Iona's brother-in-law John Costello, is facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York . Relatives of the 'quiet Irish family', who own a horse farm on Long Island's North Fork, reported them missing on Tuesday. Iona, who was her late husband George's third wife and inherited his entire estate along with her daughter, had been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. 'She can't sell anything. She can't do anything because everything is in court,' an unidentified relative told the New York Daily News. 'I don't know if she's having a nervous breakdown. I don't know if somebody has kidnapped them,' the unidentified family member said of the Costellos' long absence from their home and farm. Costello's adult children have argued that the will granting the estate to Iona was improperly executed, according to Novick Law Group. A Long Island court sided with the adult children last year, and Iona Costello is appealing. Amanda Hurwitz, one of George's daughters who now lives in Connecticut, refused to comment to Daily Mail Online on the report or her stepmother's disappearance. The widow's trip into New York was originally only supposed to last for several days. 'She said she was going to Manhattan for Easter,' Iona's mother Diana Malcolmson, 80, told Daily Mail Online. Iona Costello's husband George, the co-owner of Costello Marine in Greenport, died from a heart attack in 2012 . The grandmother, who lives in nearby Shelter Island, New York, said police told her that surveillance footage from the parking garage showed Mrs Costello and Emily walking away from their car on March 30, holding suitcases and laughing. She said that she spoke regularly with her daughter, but had not heard about any plans for extended vacations. While trips into New York were fairly normal, Emily being out of school is not. The ninth grader had been scheduled to return to Ross School in East Hampton from her Spring Break this past Tuesday. Police have reportedly told Iona's mother there is surveillance video of them leaving a parking garage laughing . The mother had told workers at her farm that she would be 'back on Tuesday' but did not return on March 31st, April 7th or April 14th. Workers at the horse farm say it is strange for Mrs Costello not to be in contact with them about raising the animals. Southold police Chief of Police Martin Flatley told Daily Mail Online that his force does not expect any foul play. He said that he does not currently have any hard evidence to point to the mother and daughter being in danger. Relative Jane Costello said that calls to both Iona's and Emily's phones go straight to voicemail.","Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily were last seen on March 30 .

"Travel to the tropics today and you’ll experience balmy annual mean temperatures of 30°C (85°F). But travel there 2.4 billion years ago, and it’s likely you would have been subjected to Arctic-like temperatures of -40°C (-40°F). This so-called ‘Snowball Earth’ theory suggests that our planet was once entirely frozen over - and it could have implications for finding life on other frozen worlds like Europa and Enceladus. A University of Cologne scientist led research proposing a new theory. It suggests temperatures at Earth's equator were -40°C (-40°F) 2.4 billion years ago (artist's illustration shown). The reasons why the whole planet was frozen are not understood. But it could have implications for finding life on frozen moons like Europa . The research, led by Dr Daniel Herwartz from the University of Cologne, was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It suggests that the entire Earth was subjected to a ‘deep freeze’, with the oceans turning into ice 1,000ft (300 metres) thick. This means that, were life to survive at the time, it would likely have had to remain in the water deep underground, below this icy crust. On other worlds in the solar system such as Europa, we see a similar icy crust - and are fairly confident that it, too, has a liquid ocean underground. A frozen world, similar to Earth, that is circling just one of a pair of stars could improve the chances of finding alien life. The planet, located 3,000 light years away, is twice as massive as Earth and almost exactly the same distance from its parent star as the Earth is from the sun. Named OGLE-2013-BLG-0341LBb, the planet’s host star shines 400 times less brightly than the sun. It has been described as the real-life version of ice planet Hoth featured in Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back. But astronomers from Ohio State University pointed out that the same planet orbiting a sun-like star would be in the 'habitable zone' where conditions are potentially suitable for liquid surface water and life. And based on this latest 'Snowball Earth', it could suggest there are many more planets that resemble ours 2.4 billion years ago. 'These events are fascinating. We had times where we really had a completely frozen Earth,’ Dr Herwartz told Discovery News. ‘If you go now to tropical regions and you imagine thick glaciers and all the oceans frozen, it’s crazy I think, but it appears to be that this has happened.’ This theory can also help explain a period in Earth’s history known as the Great Oxygen Transition, 2.2 billion years ago. Here, oxygen levels began to rapidly rise from 0.0001 per cent of present levels to the 21 per cent of the atmosphere we see today. Rapid melting across the entirety of Earth could have given rise to these increased levels of oxygen in the atmosphere. Evidence for this latest theory comes from oxygen isotopes studied in rocks in China and Russia. The exact causes for why the entire Earth seemingly froze over are not clear, though. Speaking to MailOnline, Dr Herwatz said before 2.4 billion years ago, the climate of our Earth was ‘normal’ - similar to the climate we have today. And he said a drop in CO2 levels was likely the cause of Earth turning into a snowball. 'When CO2 drops ice caps grow large,’ he explained. ‘Because ice is white, a lot of the incoming sunlight is reflected back to space and so large ice caps cause the earth to cool even further. ‘Climate modelling suggests that at a certain critical point, the Earth freezes over completely. ‘Then, so much sunlight is reflected back to space (causing such a strong cooling effect) that the Earth becomes a snowball.’ The research, led by Dr Daniel Herwartz from the University of Cologne, was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It suggests that the entire Earth was subjected to a ‘deep freeze’, with the oceans turning into ice 1,000ft (300 metres) thick (stock image shown) It may have been that increased glaciation at the poles produced an opposite ‘greenhouse effect’, with the added ice reflecting more of the sun’s light and making the planet ever-more cool, allowing the ice to spread. Volcanic eruptions - or even a supervolcano - could also have reduced the amount of light reaching Earth, allowing temperatures to drop. It appears that volcanic activity was ultimately responsible for helping Earth breaking free of its icy grip, though, increasing global temperatures. In fact, Dr Herwatz said the amount of melting probably caused Earth to go through a ‘supergreenhouse period’. The ‘Snowball Earth’ theory is not set in stone, though - some have instead suggested it may have been more of a slushball. In other words, parts of the planet may have been encased in ice, but open seawater would still have existed in some locations, such as near the equator. In Earth's past the continents were much closer together, and by 1.1 billion years ago they had formed a supercontinent known as Rodinia (left). Some moons in the solar system such as Enceladus (right) are covered in ice today, but believed to have oceans beneath their surface . Whether such an event could happen again, though, does not look likely. Dr Herwatz noted that 2.4 million years ago, the sun was not as strong as it is today, allowing the process to take place. But a second snowball-like even 600 to 700 million years ago, which wasn’t quite as severe, occurred when the sun was almost as strong as it is today. ‘So I don’t know why it should not happen again,’ he said. ‘All you need is an extension of ice caps to a certain threshold level. ‘[But] considering the man made input of CO2 into our atmosphere we are currently heading in another direction, hence a Snowball Earth climate is currently very unlikely.’","University of Cologne scientist led research proposing new theory .

"Obese workers are 'lazy' and 'unable to fulfil their roles' and as a result are less likely to be hired, a new survey has revealed. Almost half of 1,000 British companies questioned said they are less inclined to recruit an applicant after interview if they are obese or overweight. Among the reasons given were that overweight workers 'are unable to play a full role in the business', 'they're lazy', and 'they wouldn't be able to do the job required', the research shows. Beverley Sunderland, managing director, at Crosslands Employment Solicitors, who commissioned the research, said: 'Our research shows that prejudiced attitudes towards hiring obese workers are rife among British employers.' A survey of 1,000 British companies revealed almost half are less inclined to recruit an obese applicant, fearing 'they're lazy', and 'unable to fulfil their roles as required', because of their weight . The findings come in the wake of a European court case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability if it 'hinders the full and effective participation of the person... on an equal basis with other workers', when doing their job. Body Mass Index, calculated from a person's weight and height, is accepted as a reliable indicator of obesity. According to the World Health Organisation, the ideal BMI for most adults is between 18.5 and 24.9. If a person's BMI is 25 to 29.9, they are classed as overweight. At between 30 and 39.9 they are obese and 40 or over is very – or morbidly – obese. Doctors say being overweight or obese can increase the risk of health problems, including heart disease, strokes, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Earlier this year the European Court of Justice's advocate general, Niilo Jaaskinen, who advises the court, suggested that very severe obesity – classified as a BMI of more than 40 – could be considered a disability. But yesterday's ruling does not state what level of obesity would be classed as 'disabled'. It stated: 'It is for the national court to determine whether [an individual's] obesity falls within the definition of 'disability'.' Ms Sunderland said following the case, 'it appears on the face of it that the odds are against you getting a job if you are overweight'. 'But the law is on your side, as discrimination law warns against making ""stereotypical assumptions"" at every stage of the recruitment process and this applies to both existing employees, or people applying for a job,' she added. Given the ruling at the European Courts of Justice, employers now have to find way to accommodate obese workers who fall within this definition of 'disability', while larger job applicants need to ensure they are not discriminated against, Ms Sunderland said. Critics at the time warned it could encourage the overweight to avoid slimming down in the hope of securing a payout. Companies could also face millions of pounds of costs to alter offices and factories, including providing: . The survey revealed 61 per cent of employers were worried about the potential costs to the business of accommodating the side effects of overweight staff. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability, after a case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, pictured, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat . Sixty-three per cent also cited a fear of being taken to court on grounds of discrimination, if the disability needs of obese workers were not met. Just over a quarter (26 per cent) said they were less inclined to hire obese people due to their lack of awareness of the laws linked to employing overweight workers. Yet the lack of understanding of the law could land employers in hot water, Ms Sunderland warned. More than half of employers questioned were unaware that if an obese person tells an employer about their long-term conditions at interview and the company does not employ them, the applicant could try to claim disability discrimination on the basis their obesity prevented them being employed.","Survey of 1,000 firms showed half are less inclined to recruit obese people .

"Veteran actor Robert Hardy is selling his enormous collection of antiques in a £100,000 auction after deciding to downsize his home. The star, known for appearing in All Creatures Great and Small and playing Winston Churchill several times, is auctioning off more than 200 items he has collected over his career. Mr Hardy, 89, is a keen military historian who studied English with J.R.R. Tolkien and is now an expert on the medieval longbow. Sale: Actor Robert Hardy is selling off his collection of antiques including a diorama of the Battle of Agincourt . Cabinets: A pair of early Victorian items of furniture made by Gillows of Lancaster which are set to fetch up to £4,000 at the auction on Saturday . Portrait: A painting of Mr Hardy holding a longbow, reflecting his interest in medieval history . One of the most unusual items featured in the auction of his possessions is a hand-painted limewood diorama depicted the progress of the Battle of Agincourt in 3D. The piece was created by artist L.M. Rendall in the 1960s after being commissioned by Mr Hardy himself, and has an estimate of £4,000 to £6,000. There is also a longbow made from yew with a mother-of-pearl handle, as well as a portrait of Mr Hardy holding the bow, which is set to sell for up to £2,000. The actor is also selling paintings, furniture, swords, flintlock rifles, silverware and a fine collection of crystal chandeliers. Diorama: The 3D model was commissioned specially by Mr Hardy from artist L.M. Rendall in the 1960s . Close-up: The piece was rendered in amazing detail showing the progress of the battle in 1415 . Luxurious: A view of many of the items of furniture and other antiques which are being sold . Dozens of books, some dating back to the 17th century, are included in the auction which is set to take place this Saturday. A total of 238 lots are being sold by Dominic Winter auctioneers at its saleroom in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. Mr Hardy, who lives in the Cotswolds, said that he was sad to sell his collection. 'Downsizing and losing a great part of a treasured library makes for sadness,' he said. 'Entrusting it all to Dominic Winter and Co has taken away much of the pain, and through them I wish anyone who comes to possess anything that was mine as much joy and pleasure as it has given me through the years.' Historical: An early 20th-century painting of Alfred the Great rebuilding London, by Frank Owen Salisbury . Auction: The objects are being sold at Dominic Winter in Gloucestershire on Saturday . Pride: Mr Hardy pictured in 2012 with the longbow and other objects from his collection . He has built up the haul of antiques thanks to his interest in classic literature and military history. Mr Hardy was taught by Tolkien and C.S. Lewis when he studied English at Magdalen College, Oxford, and he has published two books on the history of the longbow. He was also consulted as an expert during the raising of the Tudor shipwreck the Mary Rose. Mr Hardy, a close friend of Richard Burton, worked with top actors including Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud and Judi Dench during his early days as a Shakespearean specialist. He found national fame playing vet Siegfried Farnon in All Creatures Great and Small, the hit BBC drama which aired between 1978 and 1990 and also starred Lynda Bellingham. Star: Mr Hardy, left, is known for his role as vet Siegriein the BBC's All Creatures Great and Small . Role: He has frequently played Winston Churchill in a series of television dramas . New generation: Mr Hardy appeared as Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge in the Harry Potter films . The actor is well known for portraying Winston Churchill in a number of television performances, and has also played Churchill's fellow Second World War leader Franklin D. Roosevelt. More recently, he introduced himself to a younger generation of viewers with an appearance in the Harry Potter films, where he played Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic. Mr Hardy was forced to retire from stage acting two years ago, when he suffered a fall while playing Churchill again in The Audience, a West End play about the Queen which starred Helen Mirren. However, he has insisted that he will continue to do television work despite his advanced age.","Robert Hardy, 89, is a military enthusiast who studied English literature under J.R.R. Tolkien .

"Labour's plans to change rules allowing wealthy foreigners to lower their tax bills is causing London property deals to fall through and homeowners to sell up, estate agents have claimed. Ed Miliband initially suggested he would 'abolish' the non-domicile status on Wednesday should his party take power in the General Election on May 7, but it later emerged he is effectively proposing a time limit on it of between two and five years. Although Labour aides suggested this would raise as much as £1billion, it seems the announcement has already had a negative impact on the capital's property market. Scroll down for video . Rule change: Ed Miliband joined crowds in Warwick, where he announced his non-dom plans on Wednesday . Non-domicile status allows people living and working in Britain to only pay tax on their UK income, but not earnings from overseas. Ed Mead, executive director of London-based estate agents Douglas & Gordon, said there has been a huge increase in valuations because of Wednesday's announcement - 37 in a month compared to the usual figure of about six. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'These are people who are saying ""we have finally had enough and we are going to value with a view to selling up and leaving"". 'These people spend a lot of money in the economy. I do very much fear for the top end of the market.' It's claimed the announcement has already had a negative impact on the capital's property market . Mr Mead, who has been working in the London property market for 35 years, explained it's not just the top end that will be affected. He added: 'The London market is unique - it's pulled from the top up. 'If you cut strings that's holding the market up, everything else falls down.' Charles McDowell, an independent agent hired by rich families in the capital, told the Financial Times that two deals he was involved in had fallen through this week because of Ed Miliband's non-doms plan, while two families asked him to sell their homes. He told the paper: 'My clients feel under attack, they are not going to invest in London any more.' Non-doms must prove that they regard a foreign country as their real home, but Mr Miliband argues that the tests 'are not very rigorous' and can be granted to people who have a burial plot or property abroad. Newspaper reports suggested that non-dom rules would be scrapped by Labour altogether. But  it emerged Labour would allow 'real temporary residents' to take advantage of the rules - with the time limit to be consulted on. Luxury property: Ed Mead, executive director of London-based estate agents Douglas & Gordon, said there has been a huge increase in valuations because of Wednesday's announcement . One Hyde Park: Mr Mead says he fears for the top end of the market but 'if you cut strings that's holding the market up, everything else falls down' In his speech, Mr Miliband said that everyone who has made Britain their permanent home should pay full UK tax on all their income and gains. 'It is not fair. It is not just. It holds Britain back. We will stop it. The next Labour government will abolish the non-dom rule,' he said. The Tories pointed out that a five-year grace period would exempt up to six in every ten non-doms from the crackdown anyway, because many do not stay longer than five years. Tax advisers say driving non-doms away would in fact cost the Treasury significant sums. With non-doms paying around £8billion in tax and national insurance a year, it is claimed that Labour's proposal could in fact create a huge hole in Treasury coffers. Within hours of announcing the policy, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was forced to admit he did not actually know how much extra cash the measure would raise. In a further embarrassment, it later emerged that just three months ago he himself had said such a move would be counter-productive – saying it would result in the country losing money. In a video that emerged yesterday, Mr Balls can be seen telling a local BBC radio station that abolishing the status altogether 'will probably end up costing Britain money because some people will leave the country'.","Labour plans to change rules that allow foreigners to lower their tax bills .

"Dubai is renowned as the playground of the rich and famous. It is a melting pot of decadence in the Middle East with year-round sunshine, some of the best hotels on the planet, and shopping opportunities to seriously damage the credit card. Despite the restrictions of local religious laws, the champagne-fuelled party life has come to somewhat define Dubai as a holiday destination. Dubai: It's still 'bling' but the natural habitat of the mega-wealthy has a developing cultural underside . Because of this, I have always regarded this UAE state as the natural habitat for the types of mega-wealthy who like to splash their cash; Premier League footballers, nightclub owners, rappers and reality TV stars - the Rooneys and the cast of The Only Way Is Essex will continue to flock to Dubai. So I was surprised to discover that Dubai has a rapidly developing cultural underside. In recent times, the place has attracted more unlikely visitors - A-listers including Emily Blunt, Cate Blanchett, Lily Allen, Karl Lagerfeld and Sarah Jessica Parker. Blunt was guest of honour at the recent Dubai International Film Festival, following in the footsteps of the Oscar-winning Ms Blanchett, who attended in 2013. Lily Allen was in town in November with The Verve's Richard Ashcroft to perform at Dubai's first-ever Party In The Park at the Media City Amphitheatre. And although Lily was ordered to censor her lyrics - 'They told me to cover up and not swear!' she announced on stage - punters said the relaxed atmosphere, cool crowd and outdoor, grassy setting made the festival feel like Dubai's answer to Glastonbury. Lily Allen performed at Dubai's first Party in the Park . There is now the annual Dubai International Jazz Festival. This year, Sting and James Blunt performed in February. And work is also under way to build Dubai's first opera house in The Lagoons area. The 2,500-seat venue is anticipated to be complete in 2017. Karl Lagerfeld showed his Chanel Cruise collection in Dubai, while Sarah Jessica Parker decamped from Manhattan to launch her shoe collection in The Mall of the Emirates in December. And with Western shopping meccas Bloomingdales and Harvey Nichols now established, and US emporium Macy's on the cards to open in the next few years, the retail scene also caters for more sophisticated customers. According to Cressida Meale, deputy editor of fashion magazine Grazia Middle East, there is even an underground fashion scene emerging in the city's industrial area, Al Quoz. 'It has pop-up fashion shops and cool Dubai designers,' says Meale. 'There really is another shopping side to Dubai, away from the malls.' There are also several trendy art galleries in this area. So why the sudden cultural shift? Two things seem to have happened in recent times. Firstly the party scene has relocated an hour down the road to Abu Dhabi, thanks in part to the launch of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and Ferrari World (the world's first theme park devoted to the Italian motors). Second, Dubai was also recently made host to the global Expo 2020, an honour of which it is very proud. The Government is pumping millions into creating the infrastructure for the global mega-event. So Dubai has upped its game, and with great results. Now art, music and fashion events are near-weekly fixtures on the calendar. Of course, all this has not stopped the partying - there's just a more sophisticated crowd of revellers. Branches of Western nightclubs lead the way, starting with Mayfair's most famous one, Mahiki. Art exhibitions are on the rise such as the Mojo art gallery in Al Quoz district in Duba (above) Since the club opened its doors in Jumeirah Beach Hotel three years ago, Movida and Pacha have arrived too. Do the clubs worry about Abu Dhabi stealing their party crown and cliental? Apparently not. The general consensus is that Abu Dhabi has a lot to learn from Dubai. Indeed, Mahiki recently took the party to Abu Dhabi - and arguably the greatest VIP guest of all, Prince Harry. In November the nightclub hosted a pop-up venue on a yacht for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, and, of course, the party-loving Prince couldn't resist sinking a few rum cocktails on board. But when it comes to hotels, Dubai has always been ahead. I was lucky enough to stay at the world-famous Jumeirah Burj Al Arab. World famous: The Jumeirah Burj Al Arab towers over the malls and souks of Dubai . Not only did my visit coincide with the UAE's National Day, it was also the architecturally unique hotel's 15th birthday. I have never seen a fireworks display and laser show like it. I was completely bowled over by the world-class level of service at the suite-only hotel, and even had my own butler on hand for the duration of the stay. The Al Muntaha restaurant, in the perpendicular pod that juts from the side of the building on the 27th floor, not only served the most exquisite fish, but the bartender made a mean martini too. It's little wonder the hotel that prides itself as 'the world's most luxurious' has a regular roll-call of royalty and A-listers staying. Many arrive by helicopter, landing on the helipad perched on top of the sail. Apparently it is used nearly every day. I had to slum it with a chauffeur driven Rolls-Royce Phantom picking me up at the airport. I'll be sure to book the chopper next time... The Best of Burj package costs from £2,850 per couple and includes two nights' B&B in a two-floor suite (minimum stay two nights), with private butler, dinner both evenings at Burj Al Arab's signature restaurant, massages and set of Hermes amenities.

"A Wisconsin sex offender traveled to the Middle East to try and join ISIS, but came back after he failed to cross the Turkey-Syria border, authorities have claimed. Joshua Van Haften, 34, of Madison, was arrested Wednesday night at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago after returning on a flight from Turkey. He has now been charged in a criminal complaint with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Joshua Van Haften, 34, of Madison, Wisconsin (pictured left in his mugshot on Wednesday and right in 2010 when he registed on the sex offender's list) has been accused of flying to ISIS in a failed attempt to join ISIS . The criminal complaint, which had been under seal since Oct. 28, alleges that Van Haften talked to people about his plan before leaving the United States in August for Istanbul. The complaint cites Facebook posts from Van Haften that said he was unable to cross the border from Turkey into Syria. In one post, Van Haften complained that the people who were supposed to help him just wanted his money, that he had almost no cash left and that he was dropped off on a road in the country and never picked up. Wisconsin court records showed several previous convictions for Van Haften, including felony battery in 1998, second degree felony sexual assault in 1999 and disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, in 2007, online court records show. He was apprehended at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Wednesday after getting off a return flight from Syria (file picture) All of the offenses occurred in Rock County. Van Haften was sentenced to three years' probation on the battery conviction in 1998, but his probation was revoked in 1999 and he was sentenced to a year in jail. He was sentenced to eight years' probation on the sexual assault charge in 1999, but that was revoked in 2000. He was then sentenced to seven years in prison. Assistant Attorney General Carlin from the Department of Justice said stopping people from traveling to the region to join the Islamic State is a 'top priority'. She said in a statement: 'Stemming the flow of foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria and holding accountable those who attempt to provide material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations remains a top priority for the National Security Division.

"They may look like inventions straight out of a sci-fi film, but this collection of designs were very much real and developed in a top-secret British war lab more than 70 years ago. Ministry of Defence 1, also known as ‘Churchill’s Toyshop’, was a  weapons laboratory set up in 1939 by Winston Churchill - a firm believer in the importance of science and technology in warfare. He encouraged his scientists to trial even the most absurd of inventions - many of which never made it beyond the drawing board - but some were so successful that they played a vital role in ending World War Two. Scroll down for video . Winston Churcill is pictured gives his 'victory' sign as, wearing his famed Curchillian hat, he made a polling day tour of his constituency during the election in 1945. Churchill was the Conservative candidate for Woodford, Essex, but lost in the elections . 1. THE PANJANDRUM: A GIANT WHEEL COVERED IN ROCKETS . The Atlantic Wall was a series of robust fortifications built after 1942 by the Nazis to defend against an anticipated Allied invasion. Churchill was born in Blenheim Palace into the blue-blooded dynasty of the Dukes of Marlborough. He was an enthusiastic soldier, fighting in several wars before entering politics. Churchill was made prime minister of Britain in May 1940. He survived several strokes in later life, and on his death, he had one of the largest state funerals in history. It posed a significant obstacle for Allies, and so a potential solution to create a breach large enough to allow a vehicle through was dreamed up by one of Churchill’s military think-tanks. The panjandrum was an unlikely-looking weapon, made up of two large wooden cartwheels with a ton of explosives sandwiched between them inside the axle. Cordite rockets were to propel it at predicted speeds of up to 60 miles (97km) per hour, which even without the deadly force of the explosives it carried, was pretty terrifying considering it weighed around 4,000lbs (1,800kg). After extensive trials, the prototype had a disastrous final test in which it veered dangerously off course and disintegrated in the sea. It was promptly canned. The panjandrum, pictured, was an unlikely-looking weapon, made up of two large wooden cartwheels with a ton of explosives sandwiched between them inside the axle . 2. THE TIME PENCIL: A HIDDEN DETONATOR WITH SIGHTS ON THE FUHRER . Otherwise known as ‘pencil detonators’ or officially as ‘Switch, Number 10, Delay’, these were pencil-shaped timed fuses with a vial of corrosive copper chloride at one end. They were inserted into explosives and used as a 'time delay' to set off a bomb. They could be set to delay for between 10 minutes and 24 hours. To activate it, the vial was crushed so the copper chloride would begin to dissolve a metal wire. Once the wire snapped, it released a spring that propelled a striker down the hollow tube to the percussion cap, to detonate the explosives it had been inserted into. These were used extensively during covert operations by the SAS in Africa. One of these detonators was used in the 20 July plot of 1944, in the briefcase-bomb attempt to kill Hitler. This hidden detonator used a vial of corrosive copper to dissolve a metal wire, propelling a 'striker' down a hollow tube and detonating explosives the pencil was attached to . 3. THE LIMPET MINE: LIKE A SEA MINE, BUT WITH A MAN ATTACHED . The idea of using a human torpedo to attach explosive charges had been around since the end of World War One. Churchill’s version was attached by frogmen who used the most powerful magnet in the world at the time to attach around 4.5lbs (two kilograms) of explosive to an enemy ship, capable of punching a large hole in the hull. Divers would carry the limpet mines underwater and attach them to ships, causing devastating damage when they exploded. They were used in the war to devastating effect. Seven Japanese ships were sunk or disabled by Allied commandos alone, using limpet mines in Singapore Harbour, 1943. Churchill’s 'human torpedo' used the most powerful magnet in the world at the time to attach around 4.5lbs (two kilograms) of explosive to an enemy ship, capable of punching a large hole in the hull .

Steel and aluminium were at a premium during the war, so when inventor Geoffrey Pyke, who worked at Combined Operation Headquarters (COHQ), was considering a way of protecting Atlantic convoys beyond the reach of aircraft cover, he realised the answer was ice. Specifically, he considered creating huge flotillas carved out of icebergs that could house aircraft and provide a runway. The problem was that icebergs tend to roll over, so Pyke’s answer was a combination of wood pulp and ice, which he called ‘pykrete’. This wouldn’t sink, was much stronger than ice and wouldn’t shatter, so it could easily be carved into shape. However, it never came into being. Pyke encountered a series of engineering problems that ultimately required the use of some steel in Habbakuk. Plus, the invention of long-range aircraft fuel tanks and the use of airfields in the Azores made it redundant. Geoffrey Pyke's radical idea was to build huge flotillas carved out of icebergs that could house aircraft and provide a runway - although they never came into being . 5. THE STICKY BOMB: A DEADLY EXPLOSIVE YOU (SOMETIMES) CAN’T OUTRUN . This was a kind of grenade consisting of a glass sphere filled with more than 1.5lbs (half a kilogram) of nitroglycerine, covered with an extremely sticky adhesive and encased in metal. Its handle contained a five-second fuse and a safety pin that, upon being pulled, released the metal casing and exposed the adhesive. The adhesive was added to allow the bomb to remain attached to an enemy tank for the few seconds of delay before the bomb exploded. In theory, the sticky bomb could be attached to a passing tank, although in practice tanks often proved too dirty or wet for the bombs to stick. Despite this, 2.5 million were made and used between 1940 and 1943. The Stick Bomb is shown being assembled in 1943. This was a kind of grenade consisting of a glass sphere filled with more than 1.5lbs (half a kilogram) of nitroglycerine, covered with an extremely sticky adhesive and encased in metal . 6. ARTIFICIAL HARBOURS: A POP-UP INVASION AID TO BRING THE TANKS ASHORE . ‘Mulberries’, or artificial harbours as they were otherwise known, were portable, temporary harbours designed specifically in World War Two to help the Allies unload the heavy cargoes associated with a large-scale invasion. In the years leading up to the D-Day landings, it had become apparent that any attempt to land en masse on the Atlantic coastline of Western Europe would require the use of the French harbours. And to do that, the Allies would need to depend on penetrating the Nazi Atlantic Wall, which could not be done. Instead, the Mulberries were to be transported and assembled off the French coast, providing mobile port facilities including cranes, roads and piers. ‘Mulberry A’ and ‘Mulberry B’ were successfully used for the invasion of Normandy in June 1944. The American Mulberry A was destroyed by storms but the British Mulberry B served for six months after D-Day before being decommissioned. ‘Mulberries’ (one pictured), or artificial harbours as they were otherwise known, were portable, temporary harbours designed specifically in World War Two to help the Allies unload the heavy cargoes associated with a large-scale invasion . 7. THE PIAT: A ONE-MAN ARTILLERY BARRAGE (WHEN IT HIT ANYTHING) By the middle of World War Two enemy tanks had become increasingly well armoured, to the point that they were impenetrable to the outdated infantry grenade launchers. The Projector, Infantry, Anti-Tank (PIAT) was a portable mortar system that used a powerful spring to arm and launch a  bomb weighing 2.5lbs (1.1kg) with a shaped charge up to 360ft (110 metres) away. They were first issued to British forces in 1943 and used throughout the war by the Allies. Although not entirely reliable, they were quite capable of taking out enemy tanks when they hit their targets and detonated.

"A violent Jamaican drug dealer who evaded deportation for years before he launched a frenzied hammer and knife attack on a young woman in front of her six-year-old daughter could spend the rest of his life behind bars. Lloyd Byfield, 48, pursued a relationship with 26-year-old Leighann Duffy before he armed himself with a claw hammer and a large red handled kitchen knife and smashed his way into her flat in Walthamstow, east London, on September 1 last year. After pleading guilty to murder, he was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 26-and-a-half years by Judge Nicholas Cooke who told him he may never be released. Monster: Violent drug dealer Lloyd Byfield (left) who evaded deportation for years launched a brutal and frenzied knife and hammer attack on Leighann Duffy, 26, when he burst into her flat in Walthamstow, London . Judge Cooke told Byfield he must have had a 'heart of stone' to have killed Ms Duffy despite the presence of the young girl who was herself attacked when she tried to intervene. During the Old Bailey hearing, Judge Cooke also expressed his 'unhappiness' at the failure of authorities to deport Byfield back to Jamaica when he attacked another woman with a chisel and was jailed for burglary in 2005. He said the murder could have been prevented if he had been sent back to Jamaica then. Byfield came to the UK in 2000 and was granted indefinite leave to remain on June 29, 2004 after getting married to a British woman despite being in another relationship with the mother of his child, Patricia White. Nine days before leave was granted, he stabbed Ms White with a chisel. Two months later, he broke into her husband's home and ransacked it. In March 2005 he was jailed for 30 months after pleading guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and burglary. He was ordered to be deported on May 29, 2007. At the hearing, Judge Cooke said: 'I do not know whether when you were in custody any steps were taken to minimise the risk which was represented to women, particularly those with whom you had a relationship. 'It is on any view essential that when men are sentenced for crimes of domestic violence the underlying risk to women is addressed. If it was, it was not successfully addressed. 'You were to be deported but for reasons which cannot be explained to me that was never actioned with the result you were here and able to kill a woman.' Byfield claimed he was in love with Ms Duffy and that she was sleeping with other men. But Judge Cooke said: 'That is not love. Love is caring and cherishing. This was obsessive, possessive, brutality mirroring a wholly wrong attitude to women. 'This was the pinnacle of domestic violence, a scourge which effects the lives of women and children.' Byfield was arrested days after the knife attack when he stopped a PCSO in Walthamstow High Street (pictured) saying he was wanted by the police. He told the officer 'the devil came into my head' Byfield had previous convictions for dealing cannabis in Jamaica and continued to do so in the UK, the Old Bailey heard. He had been staying with a friend in Hackney in the days leading up to the killing but was thrown out on August 31 last year. Byfield repeatedly tried to contact Leighann Duffy but she did not answer his calls until the next day. Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC said: 'It seems that Miss Duffy had some sort of relationship with this defendant. 'The defendant appears to have become fixated with Leighann Duffy in the weeks leading up to the murder.' Byfield was captured on CCTV travelling from Hackney to Walthamstow in the early morning of September 1. He appears to have spoken to Miss Duffy several times up until 2.33pm and launched his attack some time before 3pm. He banged 18 times on the front door of the flat and then burst into the victim's living room and stabbed her in the arm and neck. When she begged him to stop, he replied: 'Shut up, I don't love you any more. I hear you are sleeping with other men.' Her six-year-old daughter tried to intervene but was hit on the arm and forced away. Witnesses saw Ms Duffy stagger out of her home bleeding heavily shouting 'help me, help me' as the killer fled the scene. She was taken by London Air Ambulance to University College Hospital but died of her injuries two days later. A post-mortem at Walthamstow Mortuary gave the cause of death as a stab wound to the neck. The six-year-old girl received treatment at the scene for an injury but did not need to go to hospital. The murder weapons were recovered from the scene and Byfield was quickly identified as a suspect, police said. During the Old Bailey (pictured) hearing, Judge Cooke expressed his 'unhappiness' at the failure of authorities to deport Byfield back to Jamaica when he attacked another woman with a chisel in 2005 . He was arrested days later when he stopped a PCSO in Walthamstow High Street saying he was wanted by the police. He told the officer: 'I've done it, I'm not going to fight it. When you love someone, you are not supposed to hurt them but love can make you do stupid things. I think the devil came into my head.' Despite confessing to the officer, he later refused to answer questions. However, forensic evidence at the scene, phone records and witness accounts provided 'overwhelming evidence' of his guilt, police said. Byfield, of no fixed address, showed no reaction as he was led to the cells today. Members of the victim's family shouted 'scumbag' and 'I hope you rot in hell' from the public gallery. Leighann's mother Ann Kerr said in a victim impact statement read out to the court by the prosecutor: 'The day Lloyd Byfield broke into Leighann's house and attacked and murdered her completely ripped an entire family apart and our family will never be the same again. 'Leighann was a joyous woman who loved to laugh. Since Leighann was murdered the whole family has suffered immense depression with terrible recurring nightmares.' Detective Chief Inspector Glen Lloyd, from the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: 'This was a despicable attack on a woman at home with her young child - a place where she was entitled to feel safe. 'Byfield has shown callous and murderous intent by forcing his way in and then proceeding to inflict fatal injuries on Leighann Duffy in a pre-planned attack. 'Byfield was motivated by jealously as he had previously wished to pursue a relationship with Duffy.'","Lloyd Byfield, 48, launched hammer and knife attack on Leighann Duffy, 26 .

"Every second of the day you are subjected to radiation from compounds in soil, buildings and even your own body. But for people who fly frequently, cosmic radiation can increase this exposure significantly. Now there is an app that records your personal radiation to reveal how much you are exposed to from from medical examinations, changes in your location, and flights. The TrackYourDose app (pictured) was developed by Germany-based firm esooka and uses a mathematical model developed by scientists and meteorologists. The £1.49 ($1.99) iOS app keeps a record of a user's personal radiation including exposure from changes in a person's location and flights . The TrackYourDose app was developed by Germany-based esooka. It uses a mathematical model developed by scientists and meteorologists from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Germany and the University Oulu, Finland. Since 1997, PTB has studied the cosmic radiation at typical flight altitudes and used this to calculate radiation levels. To to do this, PTB's scientists developed a carry-on 'flight case'. Using the case, PTB's scientists measured more than 2,500 points at flight altitudes between 5 miles (8km) and 7.5 miles (12km) worldwide between 1997 and 2006. This covered geographical location, the flight altitude and solar activity. 6 µSv: Typical radiation from a dentist's X-ray . 10 μSv: Average daily natural radiation . 40 μSv: Radiation from flying from New York to Los Angeles . 100 µSv: Radiation from a 10-hour flight across the North Atlantic . 2,100 µSv: Annual radiation of a typical person in Europe . 3,000 μSv: Radiation from a mammogram . 3,600 μSv: Average annual radiation of a US citizen . 50,000 μSv: Maximum allowable yearly occupational dose in the US . 100,000 μSv: Lowest yearly dose linked to increased risk of cancer . 2,000,000 μSv: Severe and potentially fatal . It can measure all the relevant types of radiation, in particular neutron radiation produced in the atmosphere. Using the TrackYourDose app, users enter the details of the airports they are flying from and to and the date they are travelling. The current solar activity for the flight is then inputted, using a neutron monitor of the University of Oulu in Finland. In addition to tracking cosmic radiation from air travel, the app accounts for gamma radiation and cosmic radiation on the ground and medical examinations with ionizing radiation such as X-rays or CT scans lead to radiation exposure. The measurement is called the 'ambient dose equivalent' and is recorded in microsieverts (µSv). In the US, this is often measured in a unit called rem and one sievert is equivalent to 100 rem. A ten-hour flight across the North Atlantic, for instance, results in a radiation exposure of between 50 µSv to 100 µSv. By comparison, an X-ray at a dentist exposes patients to 6 µSv, depending on the type of X-ray. In 2012, the total annual radiation exposure of a typical person in Europe, through naturally occurring radiation, came to about 2,100 µSv. The same year a radiation monitor tracked 131µSv per hour at the site of the Fukushima power plant. While the average radiation of someone in the US is 3,600µSv. Experts studied the cosmic radiation at flight altitudes between 5 miles (8km) and 7.5 miles (12km) worldwide between 1997 and 2006. A TrackYourDose user enters their flights details and solar activity for the flight is inputted, using a neutron monitor from the University of Oulu in Finland . A 10-hour flight over the North Atlantic, for instance, results in a radiation exposure of between 50 µSv to 100 µSv. By comparison, an X-ray (stock image right) exposes patients to 6µSv - depending on the X-ray, while a mammogram (right) produces 3,000 μSv. A dosage of 2,000,000 μSv is considered severe and potentially fatal . Airline pilots are at risk of deadly skin cancer because they are exposed to cockpit radiation similar to levels from tanning beds. Pilots flying for an hour at 30,000ft get the same amount of radiation as 20 minutes on a tanning bed. And researchers believe the levels could be higher when pilots are flying over thick clouds and snow fields, which can reflect UV radiation . A team from the University of California measured the amount of UV radiation in airplane cockpits during flights. The cockpit radiation was measured in the pilot seat of a general aviation turboprop airplane through the acrylic plastic windshield at ground level and at various heights above sea level. Sun exposures were measured in San Jose, California, and in Las Vegas around midday in April. They then compared them with measurements taken in tanning beds. While short-wave UV-B ultraviolet radiation cannot easily penetrate glass and plastic windows, long-wave UV-A is much more likely to get through. Both kinds of UV can cause skin ageing and cancer. Approximately half of this dose comes from X-rays, mammograms, CT scans and similar. The other, natural half occurs from radioactive compounds in soil and building materials like concrete and brick. The small amount of mineral potassium in the human body is also  radioactive. Of this natural radiation, around nine per cent comes from cosmic radiation. Particles from space interact with the atmosphere and Earth's magnetic field to generate cosmic radiation. Sources are said to include gamma ray bursts, solar flares and supernovae. It is what's known as ionising, which means particles can alter charged particles from atoms that can potentially cause chemical changes in body tissue. Exposure to this kind of radiation is more significant at higher latitudes and near the magnetic poles, and many planes take polar routes to cut journey times. This exposure is so significant that in 1994 US pilots and cabin crew were classified as 'radiation workers' and the maximum allowable yearly occupational does is 50,000 μSv. Last year researchers from the University of California found that pilots flying for an hour at 30,000ft get the same amount of radiation as 20 minutes on a tanning bed. And researchers believe the levels could be higher when pilots are flying over thick clouds and snow fields, which can reflect UV radiation . The lowest yearly dose that has been linked to an increase in cancer risk is 100,000 μSv, while a dosage of 2,000,000 μSv is considered severe and potentially fatal.","The TrackYourDose app was developed by Germany-based firm esooka .

"The Eiffel Tower has been closed after workers walked out in support of the unions strike against the government's austerity measures. The nationwide strike follows action by French air traffic controllers which involved a two-day walkout starting yesterday. Now workers at the most visited paid monument in the world have joined the walkout in a solidarity with the thousands taking to the streets across the country in union-led protests against public spending cuts. Signs were placed at the foot of the Eiffel Tower warning that the landmark was closed due to strike action . There are an average 25,000 ascents at the tower every day, and at €15.50 (£11.25) a ticket, the closure will cost Paris tourism almost €387,500 (£280,000) in entry fees, excluding gifts bought and food and drink sales. Speaking to The Local, union representative Stephane Dieu said that '90 per cent' of staff had voted to strike and that signs had been placed at the foot of the tower to ensure 'tourists don't hang around for nothing.' The marches nationwide with a main rally in Paris are a test of how much support unions can muster over spending curbs which they claim undermine public service and purchasing power to the detriment of the euro zone's second-largest economy. Charles de Gaulle Airport, pictured, and other French hubs are being affected by strike action . Local media said staff who man Paris's Eiffel Tower would keep it shut it until 6pm local time as part of the strike. Representative of CGT union, one of the unions who voted to strike, Stéphane God, told AFP that the Tower is expected to be shut for 18 hours in total . Unions said they expected tens of thousands of marchers to join the main rally in Paris by the end of the day. The strike by air controllers has been called because the French air traffic union says their controllers are expected to retire later than their counterparts elsewhere in western Europe. The walk-out is one of a series planned this month, with more industrial action from April 16 to 18 and another walk-out between April 29 and May 2. Plans for the original strike on March 25 were suspended after the fatal Germanwings crash in the French Alps. The Eiffel Tower is due to reopen to the public at around 6pm this evening . Local reports claim turnout across the country is mixed, with just 1,000 taking to the streets in Strabourg, while Toulouse reported 8,000 attending demonstrations. 'We are here ... to get a change of direction from this government which claims it is left-wing,' said CGT official Pierre Tommasi of a march which included hospital, research and transport sector staff. As well as being the most popular paid-for landmark in the world, the Eiffel Tower is also the most popular spot in the world for a selfie picture. Tourist attraction site AttractionTix analysed social media to find mentions of travel hotspots alongside the world 'selfie', and have compiled a list of the most popular places to pose for a self-taken self portrait. At the top of the list was the Eiffel Tower in Paris, with more than 10,700 posts found so far in 2015, ahead of Disney World in Orlando, Florida and the world's tallest building - the Burj Khalifa - in Dubai.","Strike actions comes a day after French air traffic controllers walked out .

President Barack Obama's top spokesman, Josh Earnest, refused to engage speculation today about Leonhart's employment status nor would not put the weight of the White House behind her. Pressed to say whether the president retained confidence in his drug czar, Earnest said, 'We continue to have concerns about the material that was presented in the inspector general report that raised legitimate questions about the conduct of DEA officers.' Earnest was referring to the allegations of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct at . the DEA, the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of . Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that were examined in . a March report by the Justice Department's Inspector General. In a case study, the Inspector General said DEA's internal . affairs office in 2009 and 2010 received allegations from . 'former host-country police officers' that several DEA agents, . including senior supervisors, had 'solicited prostitutes and . engaged in other serious misconduct' while stationed in the . unnamed country. U.S. officials said the country was Colombia. The report said that 'sex parties' financed by 'local drug . cartels' took place over 'several years' inside offices leased . by the DEA. A DEA supervisor told the Inspector General's office . that it was 'common for prostitutes to be present at business . meetings involving cartel members and foreign officers.' The Inspector General's report also said 'prostitutes in the . agents' quarters could easily have had access to sensitive DEA . equipment and information.' It did not explicitly allege that . such materials had been compromised to traffickers. From left to right: Leonhart, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz and FBI Associate Deputy Director Kevin Perkins are sworn in to testify. Leonhart said there was 'no evidence' that sensitive information had been leaked but it's 'absolutely' possible that information had been compromised . The House Oversight aide who spokes to Reuters said the committee's leaks . inquiry would examine the bureaucratic culture and . leadership at the DEA and other Justice Department investigative . agencies. The events with prostitutes took place between 2001 and . 2005, but U.S. officials said the DEA did not investigate them . until years later. Leonhart has also been accused by the Inspector General of not giving out stiff enough penalties for misconduct. Supplemented by two U.S. government reports, Leonhart's . testimony raised concern among the committee's members that . agents might have leaked secrets about their investigations that . found their way to the Colombian drug lords. 'It is incredibly concerning that, according to the DEA . itself, there is a clear possibility that information was . compromised as a result of these sex parties,' Elijah Cummings, . the committee's top Democrat, told Reuters. He described the DEA agents' actions as 'truly breathtaking recklessness' in a statement. The panel's members issued a statement after Leonhart's appearance saying she had 'lost the confidence' of the committee. Leonhart 'has been woefully unable to change or positively influence the pervasive “good old boy” culture that exists throughout the agency,' they said of the second woman to hold the job. 'From her testimony, it is clear that she lacks the authority and will to make the tough decisions required to hold those accountable who compromise national security and bring disgrace to their position,' the group of 22 Republican and Democratic Members of Congress wrote. Oversight committee officials disclosed to Reuters excerpts . from a once-confidential internal DEA report which quoted an . agency informant alleging that U.S. agents who took part in the . parties had compromised sensitive information. One informant, identified by the committee as 'Cooperator . 2,' was quoted in an excerpt from the DEA report alleging that . he believed a second informant ('Cooperator 1') had 'gained . information from the U.S. agents by 'getting their guard down' through the use of prostitutes and paying for parties.' The report says Cooperator 1 'bragged about the parties with . prostitutes and how he 'sold' the relationship/closeness with . the agents' to Cooperator 2. According to the report, Cooperator 1 also 'stated he could . easily get the agents to talk.'","Anticipated departure stems from concern that agents of the federal drug agency divulged secrets at sex parties with prostitutes .

"A leader of the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood has had his death sentence confirmed by a Cairo court this weekend. Mohamed Badie and 13 other defendants were handed their sentences as 37 people, including an American-Egyptian citizen were jailed for life. The defendants found guilty of plotting unrest from their headquarters in a sprawling Cairo protest camp in the months after the military overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013. Scroll down for video . Upheld: Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie, pictured at a trial earlier this year, has had his death sentence confirmed by a Cairo judge . Judge Mohamed Nagy Shehata, known for his harsh rulings in cases involving the Muslim Brotherhood, also sentenced two Islamists who have fled the country to death. Among those sentenced to life in prison is Mohamed Soltan, an American-Egyptian man who has been on a hunger strike over his detention for more than 14 months. Soltan's family called for Mohamed's immediate release in a statement after the verdict, charging that there was no evidence against him. His father Salah Soltan was among the 14 detainees sentenced to death. The U.S. embassy in Cairo said in a statement that it was 'gravely concerned' about Mohamed Soltan and would 'continue to monitor his case closely and to provide him with all possible support.' Sentenced: Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader Badie (front) and his fellow defendants were found guilty of plotting unrest in the months after the military overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013 . Ruling: Egyptian Judge Mohammed Nagi Shehata reads the verdicts in a cases in Cairo, on Saturday . The rulings can be appealed before the Court of Cassation, which has overturned dozens of other death sentences, including against Badie. So far Egypt has executed one Islamist sentenced to death after Morsi's overthrow, following his conviction of involvement in the murder of a youth during violent protests in July 2013. Judge Shehata read out a Koranic verse that stipulates amputation and crucifixion for outlaws, before rendering his verdict on Saturday. At a previous session, he had sought the opinion of the country's mufti, the Islamic legal authority who has an advisory role under Egyptian law, on the death sentences. Known as the 'Rabaa Operations Room' case, the prosecution accused the defendants of organising months of unrest and protests against the ouster of Morsi, a senior Brotherhood figure himself now on trial. The Rabaa al-Adawiya protest camp in Cairo was dispersed by police on August 14, 2013 in a 12-hour operation that left hundreds of protesters and about 10 policemen dead. Supporters of Egypt's ousted president Mohamed Morsi stand their ground as Egyptian security forces move in to disperse them by force from the Rabaa al-Adawiya protest camp in Cairo in August 2013 . Mohamed Soltan was shot in the arm during the dispersal, and he was arrested days later as police hunted down Islamist activists who had fled the protest camp. Police moved in to disperse the camp after weeks of failed European and US-brokered negotiations with the Brotherhood, who publicly insisted on Morsi's return. The Islamist was the country's first freely elected president and he ruled only for a year before the army toppled him, spurred by massive protests demanding his resignation. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the former army chief who toppled Morsi and then won an election, has pledged to eradicate the Brotherhood. The government has blacklisted the movement as a terrorist organisation amid a spike in militant attacks that have killed dozens of policemen and soldiers. The deadliest attacks have been claimed by jihadists in the Sinai Peninsula and in Cairo, and the Brotherhood insists it is committed to non-violence. But decapitated and driven underground, the Islamist movement is believed to have radicalised with members adopting militant tactics against policemen.","Confirmed death sentences for Muslim Brotherhood leader and 13 others .

"The family of a Massachusetts woman who died from melanoma likely caused by her love of tanning are campaigning for a change to laws governing sunbeds. Glenna Kohl of Barnstable spent years in the sun as a Cape Cod lifeguard and countless hours laying in indoor tanning beds while at college. She was diagnosed with melanoma just after graduating from a Rhode Island college in 2005. Three years later, at just 26 years old, Glenna would be dead after a painful cancer battle. Now, her parents want the world to know the very real dangers posed by tanning even to the very young. Sad: Glenna Kohl of Barnstable spent years in the sun as a Cape Cod lifeguard and countless hours laying in indoor tanning beds while at college. She was diagnosed with melanoma just after graduating from a Rhode Island college in 2005 . Started in high school: Glenna was an avid tanner starting in high school and would sit in the sun some 40 hours per week every summer while working as a life guard in Cape Cod. In college, she tanned frequently in sun beds . Glenna was diagnosed with stage III melanoma after she found a golf ball sized lump in her groin just before graduating from college in 2005 . 'No one in our family knew what melanoma was,' Glenna's mother, Colleen Kohl, recalled to Cosmopolitan (via ELLE) 'We did a lot of crying.' The dreaded diagnosis came after Glenna, at just 22, discovered a golf ball-sized lump in her groin while working out at the gym one day. She would eventually see a doctor and get a biopsy. Physicians would trace the cancer back to a mole Glenna had removed years earlier, but which doctors had failed to identify as melanoma. By then, she already had stage III melanoma. But Glenna was prepared to fight. 'Whatever I have to do to fight cancer, I'll do,' her father Bob recalls his daughter saying. Because the cancer had spread to her lymphatic system, doctors removed 13 lymph nodes from her groin. Less than a year later, Glenna found a small lump in her abdomen and was told her cancer had progress to stage IV. Glenna was given more powerful drugs, but the cancer continued to spread. She tried experimental treatments with terrible side effects, but they were no use. Glenna died in November 2008, three years after her diagnosis--and her final tanning session. 'As health-conscious as Glenna was, she didn't connect tanning with skin cancer,' said Glenna's mother, who's now working to make sure others will make that connection before it's too late. 'Glenna's not here to inform people of the dangers,' Colleen told Cosmo. 'so we're going to continue her work for her.' Since their daughter's death, Colleen and Bob have launched the Glenna Kohl Fund for Hope in order to 'increase awareness of the Cape Cod community to the importance of early detection and prevention of melanoma and to support those fighting this deadly disease.' h/t YouTube/Maryellen Maguire-Eisen .

Glenna died in November 2008, three years after her diagnosis--and her final tanning session. Thanks in part to the group's efforts, the state of Massachusetts in 2014 passed a bill banning indoor tanning for those under 16 and requiring express consent from parents for those aged 16 or 17. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer with 9,000 people dying each year from the mostly preventable disease. The Melanoma Research Foundation says exposure to tanning beds before age 30 increases a person’s risk of developing melanoma by 75 percent. Doctors recommend doing regular skin checks for new moles and seeing a doctor if any change in size, shape or color. Doctors also recommend applying at least 1 ounce of sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or more to exposed skin and reapplying every two hours, more if swimming or sweating. Children in particular should be protected because bad sunburns in childhood are thought to greatly increase risk later in life.

"Breast cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer among American women . The U.S. spends $4billion (£2.7billion) a year on unnecessary medical costs due to mammograms generating false alarms and on treatment for breast tumors unlikely to cause problems, a new report has revealed. The study, published in the Health Affairs journal on Monday, has estimated the figure for women aged 40 to 59. It is made up of $2.8bn resulting from false-positive mammograms and another $1.2bn attributed to breast cancer overdiagnosis -treatment of tumors that grow slowly or not at all and are unlikely to develop into life-threatening disease. Breast cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer among American women, claiming nearly 41,000 lives a year. Annual mammograms starting at 40 years old have long been considered standard for preventive care, because cancer is easier to treat if detected early. But recently there has been disagreement about regular screening for women in their 40s. Study authors Mei-Sing Ong, a research fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, and Kenneth Mandl, a professor at Harvard Medical School, say their findings indicate that the cost of breast cancer overtreatment appears to be much higher than previously estimated. Their $4bn figure is the midpoint of a range that depends upon assumptions about the rates of false-positive mammograms and breast cancer overdiagnosis. Apart from the financial cost of screening tests and treatment, false positives and overdiagnosis expose women to risks from additional medical procedures, not to mention psychological distress. It is not uncommon for mammograms to turn up some apparent abnormality that has to be resolved with more imaging tests or a biopsy. 'We're hoping that the financial cost of this problem will help cast into greater relief the human cost,' said  Mandl. 'The two messages together are powerful. The fact that this is not only a problem, but a very costly problem we hope will accelerate the attempts to try to fix the screening practices.' But another expert defended those practices, and called the study one-sided. 'There was no attempt to balance the costs with the benefits,' said Richard Wender, who heads prevention, detection and patient-support efforts at the American Cancer Society. 'I strongly feel that every study that looks at the downsides of any screening test has to be balanced with the benefits.' The American Cancer Society recommends yearly mammograms for women starting at 40, while a government advisory group - the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force - recommends that regular screening begins at 50. The study found that women aged 40 and 49 were more likely to have a false-positive mammogram, compared to women in their 50s. Early detection: Annual mammograms starting at 40 years old have long been considered standard for preventive care, because cancer is easier to treat if detected early . The American Cancer Society recommends yearly mammograms for women starting at 40, while a government advisory group says regular screening should begin at 50 . Wender questioned the assumptions behind the new study, saying that the authors made a 'very selective choice of estimates' for the rates of false positives and overdiagnosis. 'There is no debate about the benefits of mammography,' he said. Mandl responded that the assumptions in his study are supported by other research, and that by definition there is no medical benefit to mammograms that produce false-positive results. The study was based on billing data from a major U.S. insurer, including more than 700,000 women aged between 40 and 59 in all 50 states, from 2011 through 2013. The U.S. spends much more on healthcare than any other country, but lags behind other economically advanced societies on life expectancy and certain other health indicators. That has prompted strong interest among insurers, employers and government officials in comparing the effectiveness of competing treatments, tests and medications. Cancer treatment may end up being one of the most closely followed issues in the broader debate over healthcare costs and benefits. A different study also published in Monday's Health Affairs found that cancer death rates were lower in countries that spent more on cancer care, and that countries that increased spending the most made more progress in reducing death rates.","Study estimates yearly figure for women aged 40-59 .

"David Cameron has admitted he will have failed as Tory leader if he does not win a majority at the next election. The Prime Minister said voters were not ‘fully sure’ about the Tories at the last election, but claimed they would back the party this time. He said he only needed 23 seats to win a majority, before adding: ‘If I fall short of those 23 seats I will feel I have not succeeded.’ David Cameron has admitted he will have failed as Tory leader if he does not win a majority at the next election . The Prime Minister said voters were not ‘fully sure’ about the Tories at the last election, but would back them this time . Mr Cameron made the remarks in an interview with the BBC’s Evan Davis in the second of a series of special election interviews. The PM also revealed that nothing made him ‘more angry’ than the Tories being called the party of the rich and admitted there were people who did not pay tax in Britain who ‘damn well should’. Mr Cameron’s remarks came after the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted the Tories were getting rattled because they knew they could not win an outright majority next month. Polls have consistently put the Tories and Labour Party neck and neck with just three weeks to go before polling day. But Mr Cameron insisted voters would come round to the Tories in the final days of the campaign. He said: ‘At the last election when we came close I think frankly people were very worried about the state of the economy, we were teetering on the brink and they weren’t fully sure we had all the ideas and plans. ‘What I would say is this time people can see a track record. An economy turned round, more people in work, the deficit paid down, Britain on the brink of something special. ‘This time I believe they can put their trust in me and in the Conservative Party to deliver that better future for the country.’ The PM also revealed that nothing made him ‘more angry’ than the Tories being called the party of the rich and admitted there were people who did not pay tax in Britain who ‘damn well should' Mr Cameron made the remarks in an interview with the BBC’s Evan Davis in the second of a series of special election interviews .

The Tories have said details of this will be set out after the election, and Mr Cameron said: ""What we're proposing is totally affordable and doable."" Despite his planned welfare cuts, Mr Cameron said the Tories were not the party of the rich. He said: 'Look there will be people watching this programme who go out, who work damn hard every day, they pay their taxes. 'They don’t pay their taxes so that people who can work choose not to. You know, the reward sometimes for irresponsible behaviour can drive people mad – can drive me mad and that’s one of the reasons to reform welfare.' He said that accusations that the Conservatives are ""the party of the rich"" make him ""more angry than almost anything else"". He said: 'What infuriates me so much about this is I think of what we’ve done. We’ve taken three million of the lowest paid people out of tax. 'It’s the people at the bottom end that I care about. That’s what this government has been about – more good schools for children from low income backgrounds getting people into work who’ve been unemployed.’","PM said voters were not ‘fully sure’ about the Tories at the last election .

"Six soldiers have finally been put to rest in a cemetery - more than 100 years after they were killed in the first months of World War One. The soldiers were given a burial with full military honours in an emotional ceremony which included the hymn Jerusalem in Flanders Fields, Belgium, this morning. Little has been discovered about the soldiers, as no relatives have been found, and their graves will be labelled as ‘Known Unto God’ - a description on headstones of all unknown soldiers, which was chosen by author Rudyard Kipling. Honoured: Soldiers carry the casket of a British World War I soldier during a reburial ceremony at Prowse Point Cemetery in Belgium .

Ceremony: Soldiers fold the flag on the casket of a British soldier, who was killed in October 1914 in Belgium . However, their uniforms gave a little hint at who the men had been in life: two served with The King’s Own Lancaster Regiment and two with The Lancashire Fusiliers - which both sent soldiers to attend this morning's service. The bodies of the six soldiers were discovered in a farmer's field in Comines-Warneton, near Le Touquet in Belgium, in 2008 and 2010. It is thought they had been given a field burial after they were killed in October 1914, near the city of Ypres. The area was one of the key battlegrounds at the start of the war, due to its position on Belgium's north coast, and would continue to be so throughout the four year conflict. The First Battle of Ypres, however, raged from October 19 to November 22, leaving 7,960 British soldiers dead, 29,562 wounded, and 17,873 missing, according to MilitaryHistory.com.

"Lorenzo Simon was today found guilty of murder after killing his tenant then hacking his body into pieces . A landlord who chopped his friend up and stuffed the body parts into suitcases which he dumped in a canal was today found guilty of murder. Lorenzo Simon, 34, forced victim Michael Spalding, 39, to decorate his flat before attacking him when he refused to work any longer. He then dismembered the handyman using a hacksaw and put Mr Spalding's body parts and tools into two suitcases. Simon, with the help of his girlfriend Michelle Bird, 35, then threw the suitcases into a canal which they weighed down using broken concrete slabs. Today he was found guilty of murder after a jury took 15 hours to decide by unanimous verdict at Birmingham Crown Court. Bird was cleared of murder and manslaughter but admitted assisting an offender following the four-week trial. The court heard Simon murdered Mr Spalding, known as Spud, by stabbing him in the neck at the flat they shared in Smethwick, Birmingham, on April 26 last year. He then hacked the body up and stuffed the head, limbs and tools into a suitcase. Police found his remains when a narrow boat owner spotted one suitcase, containing Mr Spalding's torso, floating in the Birmingham Canal on May 5. It was examined by a Canal Trust contractor on May 12, who opened the case to discover the gruesome evidence. Police divers recovered the second case which contained Mr Spalding's head, limbs and tools - below Pope Bridge, Smethwick, on May 16. Further searches of the canal bed uncovered a hacksaw which was used to saw off Mr Spalding's head. Using futuristic 3D scanning technology experts were able to show a perfect jigsaw fit between the charred bone and a severed limb found in the suitcase. The same technique - which provides image resolution 43,000 times more detailed that a hospital CT scan - proved a link between the hacksaw and lacerations found on other bones. Mr Spalding's body parts were found inside this suitcase, which was dumped in the Birmingham Canal . A second suitcase (pictured) containing Mr Spalding's grisly remains was discovered 11 days later . Drag marks were also found on the towpath near Pope's Bridge where Simon and Bird dumped the suitcases into the canal. Unemployed Simon, who has convictions for robbery, burglary, theft and supplying drugs, moved to Derby in a bid to evade police but was arrested with Bird on May 19. He denied knowledge of Mr Spalding's death, claiming he threw him out following a row over a car crash, but later admitted assaulting him during a fight. Neighbours reported seeing a bonfire in the garden and when officers raided the home they discovered part of a humerus bone inside the drum. Detectives later heard accounts from neighbours who told of 'aggressive, nasty' arguments coming from the flat. One recalled Simon saying: 'I want this place finished, I've got to live here, you are taking the p**s'. 3D scanning technology was able to prove a link between this hacksaw and lacerations found on Mr Spalding's bones . Mr Spalding was heard to reply: 'I'm tired, I'm hungry, I want to go home. I've been at it all day'. Adjourning the case until next Wednesday for sentencing, Justice Kathryn Thirlwall said: 'Lorenzo Simon you have been convicted of murder. As you know the sentence for murder is life imprisonment. 'The question is the minimum amount of time you should serve before the consideration of parole.' Speaking after the verdict, Detective Inspector Harry Harrison, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Michael was exploited in life by Lorenzo Simon and Michelle Bird and they afforded him no dignity in death. When police raided the home, parts of a humerus bone were discovered inside this charred drum . 'On the contrary, they treated him in the most despicable manner in order to conceal their crime. 'Simon accepted Michael as a tenant on the agreement he used his considerable handyman skills to do up the flat. 'But he treated him like a slave, working him past midnight and then waking him early in the morning to continue working. 'They were only allowed out with his say-so and given just one meal a day, usually pizza and chips. 'Michael finally broke and complained at their treatment. We believe that, combined with a car accident where Simon accused him of being responsible for damaging his VW Passat, led to the fatal attack. 'Simon said he hit Michael in the back and that he fell to the floor dead within seconds and claimed to have disposed of the body in panic. 'Bird said she was on an errand to buy alcohol at the time of the killing but later admitted helping her boyfriend in the aftermath. 'However, we were able to provide compelling evidence to the jury that this was a vicious murder and that Simon went to considerable lengths to try and cover his tracks.'","Lorenzo Simon, 34, forced tenant Michael Spalding to decorate his flat .

Oshun Kong (left) made with coriander, ginger, lemongrass and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Courgette, lime, sour cherries and strawberries in the Oshun Tang (right) The fruit bowls include Oshun Native made with acaí pulp, banana and honey; The Oshun Tang made with courgette, lime, sour cherries and acai pulp; the Oshun Kong featuring acaí pulp, banana, lemongrass, ginger, coriander and honey; and the Oshun Maya with acaí pulp, raw cacao, cinnamon, orange and avocado. Liane Holey, founder of the cafe said: ‘Brazil’s streets are filled with vendors blending acaí pulp with fresh bananas and then topped with honey and granola to create an innocuously addictive berry bowl. ‘Oshun Cafe wants the UK to celebrate this way of eating acaí, not as powder, dried supplements or in smoothies and pasteurised juices which have significantly smaller amounts of Açaí and preserved nutrients.” The acaí berry is a rich purple fruit indigenous to the Amazon rainforest. For hundreds of years, the small dark berries have been integral to the diet of native Amazonian people. The Acai Berry Bowl Cafe will serve four types of berry bowls. The cafe is open from seven days a week . Oshun Maya with cinnamon, raw cacao, orange and avocado with nested popcorn . The berries taste like blueberries and dark chocolate, with a distinctly earthy aftertaste. They are a favourite of celebrities such as Victoria Beckham, Oprah Winfrey and Matthew McConaughey. Due to their high level of antioxidants the berries are considered a superfood.They also contain high levels of manganese and Omega and are renowned for their weight loss qualities. Oshun Native - acaí pulp, banana and honey. Oshun Tang: courgette, lime, sour cherries and acai pulp . Oshun Kong: banana, lemongrass, ginger, coriander and honey. Oshun Maya: acai berries, raw cacao, cinnamon, orange and avocado . Speaking about the potent powder, food blogger and nutritionist Deliciously Ella said: 'Acai is unbelievably rich in antioxidants, with one of the highest levels ever tested (eight times that of blueberries and 10 to 30 times that of red wine,) as well as vitamin E and omega-3s, all of which work to stop free radical damage and keep your body. 'It’s also amazing for keeping your skin glowing and slowing down the signs of ageing.' The large seed from each berry is removed and the remaining Açaí pulp (along with its nutrients) is frozen within 24 hours of being harvested, due to the fresh berry’s short lifespan. In Brazil, acai berry bowls are eaten around the clock. Melt Room, which only serves toasties - or 'melts' as they are known - will open in Soho, London in May . Cashing in on the trend for single-item menu restaurants, Melt Room, which only serves toasties - or 'melts' as they are known - will open its doors in May. The menu will offer a variety of sandwiches, from the classic grilled cheese which will set you back £4.50 to more upmarket fillings such as slow-cooked lamb shoulder with mustard dressed greens. Nik Williamson of The Porridge Cafe . The menu is currently being finalised but there will approximately be four breakfast toasties or 'melts' as they will be called, and six signature melts . The 12-seater cafe will also serve seasonal specials and 'hero melts' with unique cheeses. Melt Room follows on the heels of Old Street's Porridge Cafe, Simply Crispy in Belfast which serves crisp sandwiches and Brick Lane's Cereal Killer Cafe . The Porridge Cafe - from the founders of The Bow Street Kitchen Nik Wiliamson and Elly Harrington - opened in early March and serves 25 types of porridge made from 11 different grains. Prices range from £2.35 for a bowl of basic porridge to £7 for the more hearty versions, with meat and vegetable toppings. The cafe serves both sweet and savoury versions of the traditional breakfast dish. In December 2014 self-confessed cereal obsessives Alan and Gary Keery launched the UK’s first cereal cafe featuring 120 cereals, 20 types of toppings and 12 varieties of milk. The identical twins’ establishment opened in Brick Lane, London and offers a menu of over 100 cereals from around the world. The duo came under fire when they first opened their cafe, for charging £3.20 for a bowl of cereal. The single-item cafe movement is not just confined to London. Belfast's Simply Crispy which opened earlier in January was the brainchild of businessman Andrew McMenamin who had planned to keep his pop-up going for just four weeks.

Belfast's Simply Crispy which opened  in January is the brainchild of businessman Andrew McMenamin . But with diners queuing down the street to get their hands on the snacks, which have sold out every day, the cafe will now stay open and could even expand to other shops in Northern Ireland, Dublin, or London. 'We have managed to sell out every day - not the crisps though, the bread, the baps. We can't get our hands on enough fresh baps because everything flies out of the door,' Mr McMenamin said. Moo’d, opened by best friends Zoe Blogg and Jen Gibb in Leeds in February this year, offers 100 different cereals as well as ‘cocktails’ consisting of mixed varieties of different brands. Not wanting to be left behind, two rivals are racing to become Manchester's first cereal cafe. Black Milk Cereal Dive has confirmed it will open in Afflecks Palace this month, and according to Twitter, Cereal Central MCR is 'coming soon.' The acai berry is a rich purple palm fruit indigenous to the Amazon rainforest. For hundreds of years, these small dark berries have been integral to the diet of native Amazon people. The berries are packed with amino acids, as well as vitamins A, B, C and E and minerals such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper and zinc. The fruit perishes quickly after being picked, so to help preserve its goodness it is often made into acai berry juice, supplements or powder, which is often whizzed into a smoothie. According to some sites selling acai products, the berry's fibre and essential fatty acid content contribute to its ability to burn fat more efficiently, process food more quickly, cut down on cravings, and boost metabolism.","Oshun Cafe serves four variations of Brazilian superfood, costing £6 each .

"A farmer has been forced out of her home after a neighbour repeatedly exposed himself to her. Mandy Dunford, 54, was followed around her farm in the North Yorkshire Moors by 67-year-old Kenneth Ward, naked apart from socks and boots. The military historian even performed sex acts in front of her. Ward was jailed for five years in 2011 after admitting 11 counts of exposure and numerous firearms offences. Farmer Mandy Dunford, 54 (right), feels forced to leave her home after neighbour Kenneth Ward, 67 (left), who was jailed for exposing himself to her in 2011, was released from prison and allowed to return to his home . Police had discovered of a cache of weapons, including machine guns, in his home. A judge at Teesside Crown Court also imposed a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, banning the flasher from being within 200 metres of Miss Dunford. But while the former police officer believed her nine-year ordeal of harassment was over, Ward has now been released – and has successfully appealed to have the restraining order overturned. It means he will be able to return to his cottage next door to Miss Dunford’s farm in Chop Gate, North Yorkshire. As a result, she said she feels forced to leave. ‘I feel yet again that the offender has been given more rights than the victim,’ the farmer said. ‘My punishment for his crimes has been far worse than anything he has ever faced – I’m losing my home so that he can return to his … I expected to live here for the rest of my life with my animals around me.’ In a hearing held since Ward’s sentencing, a new boundary was drawn up allowing him to approach Miss Dunford’s farm from all sides. She added: ‘It means he can follow me around with only the width of a wire fence between us. ‘When I heard the order had been changed … I was horrified and I knew my only option was to pack up and leave. I will be forced to abandon my home and my life just so that he can return … I can’t see the justice in that and I want to know why the rights of a man who tortured me for so long are more important than mine.’ Miss Dunford’s problems with Ward began when she put a gate across a lane shared by their properties. Ward was jailed for five years in 2011 at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) after admitting 11 counts of exposure and numerous firearms offences. However, he has now been released and allowed to return home . She said: ‘He first started exposing himself to me around 2002 and would peer in through my windows with his wild staring eyes. ‘He’d run around the house at night shouting and tapping on the windows … he’d come right up to me and follow me around wearing nothing but boots and socks. ‘Sometimes he’d climb a ladder and expose himself over the wall of his cottage and once he confronted me on the lane and aimed a rifle at me. I turned and ran and heard five shots go off … I went to the police to report him but their response was hopeless.’ Ward and his brother also left piles of maggot-infested animal carcasses outside her home. Police finally arrested him after Miss Dunford filmed the harassment and showed them hours of footage.","Mandy Dunford forced out of home after neighbour exposed himself to her .

"Just a day after being released from jail, the man who was beaten by cops following a two-and-a-half hour chase on horseback has spoken out to detail his painful arrest. Helicopter cameras caught a swarm of cops kicking and punching 30-year-old Francis Pusok more than 80 times on Thursday, after he fled his southern California home when they tried to arrest him for identity theft charges. In an interview with NBC 4 on Monday,  Pusok revealed that he had been handcuffed for '99 per cent' of the beating and that near the end of the scarring experience a deputy whispered into his ear 'This isn't over'. Scroll down for video . Scarring experience: Francis Pusok (left) spoke for the first time on Monday, four days after he was beaten up by cops in footage taken from a helicopter. His girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner, pictured center . When San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies arrived at Pusok's house on Thursday, he said he  fled 'because any contact with police has been negative for me'. As the chase was coming to a close about two and a half hours later, video shows Pusok falling to the ground as he is hit with a taser and two deputies approach. The officers then start to assault Pusok, and later claimed that his taser had been ineffective due to his loose clothing - even though Pusok is clearly seen convulsing from the electric shock in the helicopter footage. On the run: Pusok fled his house in San Bernardino County on Thursday after Sheriff's deputies showed up to arrest him on identity theft charges. He led police on a more than two-hour long chase, part of it on horseback . On the ground: At the end of the chase, police officers shot Pusok with a taser and he fell to the ground. Pusok claims they handcuffed him within 15 seconds and then continued to beat him despite the fact he was lying helpless on the ground . Cruel: The helicopter continued to record the first two cops beating Pusok up as more deputies swooped in . Under investigation: In the aftermath of the disturbing video, 10 officers have been placed on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated . Pusok estimates that within 15 seconds of the first taser hit, the cops had him in handcuffs but says they continued to assault him and yelled 'stop resisting' even though he was laying face down on the ground. He says the officers went on to tase him two more times after he was in handcuffs. Pusok remembers the cops 'hitting me every place that they could hit me - anywhere and everywhere.' 'I thought I was being beaten to death,' said Pusok.. 'I was wondering, ""When is it going to stop?""' Bruised: Pusok sports a painful black eye in his booking photo. He was released from jail on Sunday . After the incident, Pusok was arrested on suspicion of evading, stolen property, reckless driving and theft of a horse. He was treated for his injuries while being held at West Valley Detention Center where he was released Sunday night at bail. A court hearing has been scheduled for June 16, but San Bernardino County Prosecutors said Monday that they had not yet made a decision on whether to file formal charges against Pusok. Meanwhile, 10 officers - including a sergeant and a detective - involved in the incident have been placed on paid leave as the FBI starts an investigation into whether excessive force was used in the arrest. San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said last week that he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video and that an internal investigation is underway into  the deputies' actions. A criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out, he said. However, he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid. In his interview on Monday, Pusok said he thinks his prior run-ins with police may have sparked their violent backlash. Indeed, Pusok's lengthy criminal record includes charges of obstructing an officer and resisting an officer, as well as attempted robbery, animal cruelty and fighting or offensive words. Deputies have been called to Pusok's home before, during which he threatened to kill a deputy and shot a puppy in front of his family, Sheriff McMhaon said. Disturbing: San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon says he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video and that he has launched an internal investigation . However, Pusok's pregnant girlfriend, Jolene Bindner, says some of the prior charges against her longtime partner have been trumped up. Bindner told NBC that the charges he threatened to kill a police officer are 'absolutely not true. I was there the whole time.' She also said that Pusok, father of their three children, was arrested in 2002 for driving at unsafe speed on a sidewalk but that he was only riding a bicycle at the time. What concerns Bindner the most though was the one deputy's alleged whispered threat of 'This isn't over' at the end of the beating. 'That concerns me because we have children together and I don't want any kind of retaliation against me or my children,' she said. Doing better: After visiting her longtime partner in jail on Sunday, Pusok's girlfriend Jolene Bindner said he was on the road to recovery . Threats: The couple share three children together and have another on the way. Bindner (left) says she is concerned about a deputy who whispered 'This is not over' to her boyfriend at the end of the beating . Pusok's attorney Jim Terrell said his client's criminal history has nothing to do with any possible excessive force case. 'If it wasn't for that helicopter and the camera...they would be charging him with 10 counts of battering a police officer,' Terrell said. 'That's how it rolls here, that's what goes on every single day.' Pusok's beating came as recent violent episodes by officers dealing with suspects have hit the headlines, including the killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend. Scott, 50, who was unarmed, was shot dead by 33-year-old Officer Michael Slageras he ran away from him during a traffic stop. Slageras has since been arrested and charged with murder. The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement saying it is 'deeply troubled by the video images' and applauding McMahon's call for an investigation.","Francis Pusok, 30, was arrested Thursday after a hours long chase with police in San Bernardino County, California .

"Fruit juices made from so-called superfoods such as cranberries and pomegranates often have more sugar than a can of cola, officials have warned. While the drinks are said to have health benefits, some brands contain more than a day’s recommended intake of sugar in a single 300ml serving. The Local Government Association, which represents councils that are responsible for public health, accused soft drink firms of ‘dragging their heels’ when it comes to minimising sugar in their products. Ocean Spray Cranberry Classic juice drink (pictured left) was found to have 11g of sugar per 100ml, which is more than the amount in a can of Coca-Cola (right) It said children under the age of ten get almost a fifth of their sugar intake from soft drinks. In a survey, the organisation found that some cans of fizzy drinks contain almost twice the recommended daily sugar limit for adults. Even some fruit juices contain more than a single day’s limit in a single serving – surpassing a can of Coca-Cola. Ocean Spray Cranberry Classic juice drink was found to have 11g of sugar per 100ml, while PomeGreat ‘Super Juice’ had 12.1g. Both exceed the 10.6g per 100ml in a can of Coca-Cola – but do not come close to the 15.1g per 100ml in Old Jamaica Ginger Beer. A 300ml serving of any of the four drinks would breach the 25g daily sugar limit recommended by the World Health Organisation. Juice businesses insisted the study is misleading because it does not differentiate between unhealthy added sugar – such as monosaccharides and disaccharides in fizzy drinks – and natural sugar found in fruit. Cranberry juice is frequently promoted as a health product which is said to ward off urinary tract infections. And pomegranate juice has been linked to resistance to prostate cancer and heart disease. The LGA is calling for a fifth of the VAT raised on sugary drinks, sweets and takeaway food to go to councils to pay for public health schemes. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, Tory leader of Warwickshire county council and chairman of the LGA’s Community Wellbeing Board, said: ‘It is wholly unacceptable for one normal-sized can of soft drink to contain double the recommended daily limit. ‘Products like these are fuelling the obesity crisis and helping wean a generation of overweight children. ‘We are calling on the sector as a whole to step up and show more corporate responsibility.’ A spokesman for Ocean Spray said cranberries are naturally low in sugar, so sweetening is required. Vitamin Water is promoted for its health benefits, but drinks contain four teaspoons of sugar per 330ml . She added: ‘We offer consumers a range of reduced sugar options including our Cranberry Classic Light product . ‘We’ve made and continue to maintain a firm commitment to low-sugar innovation, and through product formulation, price promotion and portion sizes we seek to offer the best choice in flavours, calories and formats.’ Adam Pritchard, chief executive of PomeGreat, accused the LGA of distributing misleading research. He said his product does not include refined sugar, which the WHO says is more harmful than naturally occurring fruit sugars. PomeGreat instead includes pinitol, a natural compound which stops blood sugar levels rapidly rising. Mr Pritchard said: ‘To lump us in with big fizzy drinks companies is just misleading. ‘We are a small company competing with huge multinational businesses which are just chucking sugar into drinks because it is cheap. ‘We use a much more healthy natural sweetener which costs 2.5 as much as refined sugar. It is not the same thing.’","Fruit juices made from so-called superfoods such as cranberries and pomegranates are lauded for health benefits .

"Nasa has released the first close-up views of the north pole of dwarf planet Ceres from the Dawn spacecraft. Dawn arrived on 6 March, the first time a spacecraft has orbited a dwarf planet, and is now preparing for the key science phase of the mission. However, the images have not yet revealed what the mystery ‘bright spots’ on the surface of the world are, which have gripped the attention of scientists and the public alike. Nasa scientists in California have released new images of Ceres (shown). They were taken by the Dawn spacecraft from a distance of 21,000 miles (33,000km). The spacecraft is beginning to move closer and closer to Ceres. And it will soon study the whole planet - including its mystery bright spots . The latest images were taken on 10 April from a distance of 21,000 miles (33,000km), and are the highest-resolution views of Ceres so far. The spacecraft is currently on the side of the planet that is mostly shrouded in darkness, but over the coming months it will see more of the world in light. And it will also see Ceres in better and a higher resolution. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. It is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star, allowing ice to melt and reform. Nasa's Dawn spacecraft has been making its way to Ceres from the asteroid Vesta since September 2012. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres because it is seen as being a record of the early solar system, and may also have shifting ice on its surface. Ceres is the largest body in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, with an average diameter of 590 miles (950km). Dawn has been using its ion propulsion system to rendezvous with the dwarf planet since leaving the giant asteroid Vesta in 2012. Its first ‘science orbit’ will begin on 23 April, with the spacecraft remaining a distance of 8,400 miles (13,500km) away until 9 May. After this, it will begin making lower and lower orbits to get better views of the surface. The mission will allow scientists to study the last major body between Earth and Jupiter that has yet to be explored. 'The mission is so exciting, because we're exploring the last uncharted world of the solar system,' Dr Marc Rayman, Dawn chief engineer and mission director at JPL told MailOnline. 'For me the opportunity to travel to this distant alien world that has been known of for two centuries, a mysterious world of rock and ice, perhaps with subsurface liquid water maybe stored as ponds, lakes or oceans, is very exciting.' Shown above is an animation of Ceres rotating as Dawn observed its north pole. Ceres is about 2.8 times further from the sun than Earth, and a day on the dwarf planet lasts nine Earth hours. Credit: Nasa . Dawn (artist's illustration shown) has been using its ion propulsion system to rendezvous with the dwarf planet since leaving the giant asteroid Vesta in 2012. Its first ‘science orbit’ will begin on 23 April, with the spacecraft remaining a distance of 8,400 miles (13,500km) away until 9 May . In the next few weeks and months, the dwarf planet will be studied in great detail. But the most impressive images will be returned in December, when Dawn starts one of its lowest science orbits. It will be at an altitude of just 225 miles (360km) above the surface - below the orbital height of the International Space Station around Earth - allowing it to get high resolution images of the surface. The primary science mission for the spacecraft will last until June 2016 - by which the team expects to have achieved all of its scientific goals -and it is unlikely the spacecraft will be extended beyond that date, as it will probably start running out of fuel by then. This map-projected view of Ceres was created from images taken by Nasa's Dawn spacecraft during its initial approach to the dwarf planet, prior to being captured into orbit in March 2015. Differences in morphology and color across the surface suggest Ceres was once an active body . Perhaps of most interest, though, are the mystery bright spots on the surface. These are thought to possibly be expanses of ice inside a crater on Ceres. Based on new infrared images released by Nasa the other day, it appears that the pair of spots have different thermal properties - suggesting they have different origins. They could also be towering ‘water volcanoes’, but more observations will be needed to confirm or deny this. 'The bright spots continue to fascinate the science team, but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source,' said Chris Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles. These images, from Dawn's visible and infrared mapping spectrometer (VIR), highlight two regions on Ceres containing bright spots.

"Gemma Redhead was left terrified after her former partner telephoned her after he was released from prison, following a conviction for raping her . Brutally raped at knifepoint and left fearing for her life, Gemma Redhead believed her ordeal was over after her attacker was jailed. But as she attempted to rebuild her life, the young mother had a sickening reminder of the attack – from the man who carried it out. After he was released from prison, having served only half his sentence, he defied a restraining order to phone her. Miss Redhead said the 46-second call ‘reawakened all of the fear and terror of the attack’, leaving her unable to sleep or eat. ‘As soon as I heard his voice I realised who it was, and it disturbed something deep down inside of me,’ she said. Miss Redhead, 33, who has waived her right to anonymity, was left with post-traumatic stress disorder after being repeatedly raped by her former partner, Philip Kirby. She endured eight years of violence at the hands of bullying Kirby and his attacks became so brutal she lived in fear every day, thinking he would kill her. In August 2010 the mother-of-four, who has a child with Kirby, decided to break up with him. After they separated, Kirby, 32, refused to acknowledge the end of their relationship and begged Miss Redhead to take him back. He continued to harass her and eventually forced his way into her home before subjecting her to a harrowing ordeal. After the first horrifying attack, Miss Redhead begged him to leave, but he told her: ‘I’m already going to jail for a long time so what difference does it make?’ before raping her again. Kirby, of Newcastle, initially denied rape. But on the first day of his trial he changed his plea, admitting four counts of rape. In April 2011, he was jailed for eight years with a five-year extended licence period. He was also handed a restraining order which banned any contact with Miss Redhead for the rest of her life. Meanwhile she began counselling, including cognitive therapy, and medication to help her overcome her post-traumatic stress disorder. But she says her hopes of rebuilding her life have now been shattered. She said: ‘It is a daily struggle and an ongoing battle to deal with this. After his initial arrest I was hopeful for the future and felt free and that I could begin to rebuild my life. Philip Kirby had been sentenced to eight years in prison but was released after three years, and phoned his former partner. The rapist had been banned from contacting her for life and will now not be released until 2023 . ‘I now feel it will never be so and he will not leave me alone.’ Referring to the chilling phonecall, Miss Redhead added: ‘But at the same time I was not surprised. I had always felt as though he would come after me once he was released.’ She said Kirby had tried to ‘destroy’ her and she feared he would continue to harass her for the rest of her life. ‘We tried so hard to rebuild our lives after he virtually destroyed it,’ she said. ‘He will never leave us alone. We just can’t escape him. We feel trapped by his behaviour. Why can’t he just leave us alone to get on with our lives? I just want my family to be left in peace.’ Miss Redhead described herself as being in an ‘extreme state of anxiety’ since the phone call from Kirby. She said: ‘I will no longer go outside on my own. I can’t eat or sleep and when I do sleep I have constant nightmares and flashbacks. I am really scared. Ms Redhead was left with post traumatic stress disorder after the attack. She is pictured (above) with Kirby during their relationship . ‘Despite telling probation he wouldn’t contact me, he has. Prison has not been a deterrent for him. I feel very fearful of what he would do next. ‘I am still full of fear. I would like to be free of fear and not constantly worrying about his next release date.’ After the phone call Kirby was hauled back to court and he admitted breaching his restraining order. On Friday, Newcastle Crown Court heard that Kirby was released from prison in November last year and after drinking vodka he decided to contact his victim last month. He was sentenced to a further six months and will not be released until 2023, serving his full jail term. Judge Deborah Sherwin said: ‘What makes this matter particularly bad is the effect she suffered at your hands originally. ‘It is not part of my function to sentence you again in respect of that but it is the legacy of that, that she feels vulnerable and afraid, therefore any phone calls made by you would have a greater effect on her than they might do to any other person.’","Philip Kirby was jailed for eight years in 2011 for raping Gemma Redhead .

"A city's communications boss has been fired after she allegedly stopped a tourism photo shoot with a black and an Asian model and told the photographer they were 'not the image I want for the city'. Rosemary Taylor, communications director of the City of Brookhaven in Georgia, made the 'racist' remark to hired photographer Nelson Jones at the local Cherry Blossom Festival two weeks ago . After witnessing Mr Jones capture a test shot of models Dominique Jackson, 18, and 19-year-old Khamlee Vongvone at the event, she apparently went over to him and referenced the two girls. She reportedly told him: 'This is not the image I want for the city of Brookhaven'. The girls' mouths 'dropped' and, moments later, they and Mr Jones were asked to leave the festival by a city official. Scroll down for video . Models: Rosemary Taylor has been fired after she allegedly stopped a tourism photo shoot with Dominique Jackson (right), 18, and Khamlee Vongvone (left), 19, and said they were 'not the image I want for the city' Sacked: Taylor (pictured) communications director of the City of Brookhaven in Georgia, made the 'racist' remark at Cherry Blossom Festival, which photographer Nelson Jones had been hired to take pictures of . Now, Ms Taylor, who had been in the high-profile position for less than a month, according to her LinkedIn page, has been fired by officials for exhibiting 'conduct unbecoming of a city employee'. In a statement, Brookhaven’s leadership told WSB-TV: 'Rosemary Taylor was relieved of her duties as the city's communications director after she exhibited conduct unbecoming of a city employee.' However, Ms Taylor has released her own statement, in which she claims she was wrongly accused in the incident, which occurred between March 27 and 29, and says Mr Jones was 'unprofessional'. In the release, seen by the Atlanta Journal Constitution, the sacked employee writes: 'Racism had absolutely nothing to do with my interactions with the photographer and his hired models.' She adds: 'It had all to do with a lack of professionalism on behalf of the photographer, a conflict of interest, misuse of city funds and money spent unnecessarily. Ms Taylor says she had already decided to hire another photographer after deciding that Mr Jones's work was 'simply not acceptable' - and had not discussed hiring models as part of the festival job. Day of the incident: Dominique (left) and Khamlee (right) are pictured in a test shot just minutes before Taylor approached them and Mr Jones. The trio were then asked to leave the event by a city official, it is reported . Communications director: Taylor (pictured in her LinkedIn photo) had been in the high-profile job for the City of Brookhaven for less than a month when she was fired for exhibiting 'conduct unbecoming of a city employee' 'When I questioned [Mr Jones] about the models and why he was posing them in the VIP tent, against the festival's branding, as if it was a photo shoot, he got agitated and defensive,' she writes. 'My mistake was getting agitated back, as he continued to tell me he was the official photographer and he had hired top models and this was going to be good for the city. I told him it wasn’t.' Mr Jones told WSB-TV that he was pleased Ms Taylor had been fired by the City of Brookhaven on Monday, adding that both he and the models had considered her remark racist and offensive. According to her LinkedIn page, Ms Taylor has previously worked for CBS, People Magazine and ABC. In January, she left her job as Senior Communications Manager of the City of Johns Creek. An internal investigation into the incident is ongoing. Offended: Mr Jones said he was pleased Taylor has been sacked, adding that both he and the two models had considered her remark racist and offensive.

"The book Sex by Numbers: What statistics can tell us about sexual behaviour was released this week and it's a must-read for anyone fascinated by who really does what, where, when and how in bed. The author, David Spielgalhalter, a Cambridge University professor, sets out to investigate various sexual statistical claims and separate myth from reality. It's prompted me to do the same. Scroll down for video . Scientists who reviewed 20 different studies of penis size, including 15,521 measurements of penises from around the world found some surprising results. Since no other part of the human body is more shrouded in myth and folklore than men's most precious part, it seemed the penis was the most deserving subject to study. Here's what the latest research has to say: . So, it is really six inches? A new paper in the British Journal of Urology International is based on the results of scientists who reviewed 20 different studies of penis size, including 15,521 measurements of penises from around the world. Most importantly, it was based only on studies where the penis had been measured by a trained health professional (surprise, surprise: men aren't terribly honest or accurate when they measure it themselves). The result: most men fall within just a couple of centimetres of each other, with most measuring around 5.2 inches in length when erect with a 4.6 inch circumference. If he wants to DIY, the correct way to measure a penis is to use a cloth measuring tape, not a straight-edged ruler. He should measure while it's erect and measure the side facing his stomach, pushing the tape down to press against the pubic bone (so he's not measuring fat!). Tracey investigate various sexual statistical claims and separates myth from reality . The average time between penetration and him ejaculating (for heterosexual couples) is nine minutes. This was the result of a European study of 1,100 couples from 44 countries. Each couple attempted intercourse at least twice a week for eight weeks and used a stop watch, clicking it on the minute he penetrated and clicking stop immediately after ejaculation. Previous studies settled on between two or three minutes duration; another rated the 'ideal time' of intercourse for both men and women at between three and 13 minutes. The more he exercises, the stronger his erection. A new study in the Journal of Sexual Medicine looked at how physical activity affected erectile functioning. Men who exercised the most (18 hours a week) had the highest sexual functioning scores. Watching porn doesn't affect his ability to perform. Two reputable online surveys found no link between the use of pornography and erection problems, despite popular perception that watching too much porn leads to ED (erectile dysfunction). What does make sense (though, again not proven) is that men who have difficulties turn to porn as a way of experiencing sex without embarrassment. Great sex does not depend on a big penis. A study including opinions of 25 highly respected sex therapists identified eight elements that make up the best sex you can possibly expect. Guess what? The penis didn't even get a look in. The myth that big hands/big feet/big nose means a big penis has no scientific proof or evidence supporting it whatsoever. But height did make a difference: the taller the man, the longer his penis is likely to be. Bald guys have a stronger sex drive. This may well have legs. The myth says bald men are more virile than men with hair because they have more testosterone in their body (which can cause hair loss). The testosterone/hair loss link is proven. Baldness is caused when hair follicles become exposed to too much dihydrotestosterone (DHT) which is a chemical produced by the male hormone testosterone. Testosterone is also the chemical responsible for his libido. The average number of erections per day for most men is seven. But five of these occur while he's asleep. The penis has a safety-valve that ensures a man can't ejaculate and urinate at the same time. The average quantity of semen ejaculated is 3ml. The average speed of ejaculation is 28 miles per hour. The amount of blood in an erect penis is ten times more than when it's flaccid. It shoots from 9ml flaccid to 90ml erect. One testicle hangs lower than the other to avoid them getting squashed when he walks! Eighty-five percent of men find their left testicle is lower and larger.

"Chaos over Labour's plan to target wealthy foreigners has left even Ed Miliband's own family baffled. Mike Keen, the Labour leader's cousin, said he was 'officially confused' over whether or not the party was actually promising to scrap non-dom rules. Mr Miliband used a speech yesterday to say he would 'abolish' the 200-year-old rule for non-doms, but in January Ed Balls said it would cost the country money. Mike Keen, the Labour leader's cousin, said he was 'officially confused' over whether or not the Ed Miliband was actually promising to scrap non-dom rules . Mr Keen posted on his public Facebook page that he needed someone to explain to him just what the Labour policy was . Non-domicile status allows people living and working in Britain to only pay tax on their UK income, but not earnings from overseas. They must prove that they regard a foreign country as their real home. But Mr Miliband argues that non-dom tests 'are not very rigorous' and can be granted to people who have a burial plot or property abroad. Newspaper reports suggested that non-dom rules would be scrapped by Labour altogether. But  it emerged Labour would allow 'real temporary residents' to take advantage of the rules - with the time limit to be consulted on should they take power in the General Election on May 7. In a speech in Warwick yesterday, Mr Miliband said that everyone who has made Britain their permanent home should pay full UK tax on all their income and gains. 'It is not fair. It is not just. It holds Britain back. We will stop it. The next Labour government will abolish the non-dom rule,' he said. He was backed by Mr Balls, the shadow chancellor, who told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'We're going to change it, abolish it and it will raise a lot of money.' But it emerged in a January interview Mr Balls said: 'I think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing Britain money because there will be some people who will then leave the country.' The contradiction was seized on by the Conservatives, who produced an internet graphic showing Mr Balls' two quotes. Mr Keen, a retired GP, posted the image to his Facebook page, adding: 'Can someone explain this to me please, I am now officially confused.' In January shadow chancellor Ed Balls warned: 'I think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing Britain money because there will be some people who will then leave the country.' A friend suggested he 'ask a certain member of your family I am sure he will give you chapter and verse on it and invite him into the group I am sure we won't abuse him to much'. Mr Keen asked his friends on the site: 'What would you say to my lil cuz if he were on here?' Announcing the policy, Labour aides suggested the change in the rules, which date back to the 18th century, would raise as much as £1billion. But tax advisers immediately disputed this, saying driving non-doms away would in fact cost the Treasury significant sums. With non-doms paying around £8billion in tax and national insurance a year, it is claimed that Labour's proposal could in fact create a huge hole in Treasury coffers. Last year Mr Keen declined to say if he was planning to vote for his cousin. He told the Sunday Times: 'Ed's my cousin and I have known him all my life. That's all I can say. I don't talk about politics on the doorstep.' And he suggested that voters think David Miliband would have made a better Prime Minister. He said: 'The people out there will say David would have made a really good prime minister. That's the general feeling out there. People don't take the piss out of him. They wouldn't dare. People wouldn't take the piss out of Dave.'","Mike Keen revealed he was 'officially confused' in public Facebook post .

"This eighteen-month-old boy pulled a rice-cooker brimming with boiling water down on his head, burning deep scars into his face and leaving him almost blind. As a crack team of surgeons from the Australian charity, Interplast, worked last March to save the sight of little baby Seng, from Vientiane, Laos, inspirational burns survivor Turia Pitt watched on. Turia was deeply moved by the plight of the baby with big, brown eyes. That's because she knows that if she lived in a country like Seng's, she wouldn't be here. Foreign doctors wouldn't have been able to save her from the flames that nearly killed her by lashing 64 per cent of her body with burns in 2011. 'I wouldn't have survived,' she said during a candid interview ahead of hosting a fundraising gala on Thursday which aims to raise funds for more volunteer medicos to head overseas to save lives and livelihoods. 'If I was from Laos or Bangladesh, no ifs or buts, 100 per cent I would have died.' Scroll down for video . Stronger than ever and inspired by a little burned baby: Turia Pitt (pictured), who experienced burns to 64 per cent of her body during a September 2011 ultramarathon through the Kimberley, Western Australia . Burned by boiling water: Little baby Seng (left) is pictured being operated upon by surgeons in Laos (right) in a desperate attempt to save his sight. Turia Pitt witnessed the operation . Seng's sight was saved by keen doctor volunteers from Interplast. Turia told Daily Mail Australia Seng was 'for sure' one of her inspirations in working for Interplast . Fitter and stronger than ever: Turia Pitt's recovery from the horrific burns that left her clinging to life is inspirational. She recently ran a half-marathon and beat the time she ran before the 2011 Kimberley blaze . Turia, who has been operated on more than 200 times since she was caught in the flames, believes Australians take their medical system for granted. Her remarkable recovery is a case-in-point. Few would have thought she would be more athletic now than she was before she was seared with burns while running the Kimberley ultra-marathon three-and-a-half-years ago. 'I'm fitter now than I was before!' Turia told Daily Mail Australia. Nervous about medical complications, Turia was 'dumbfounded' when she ran a half-marathon last month at a quicker pace (1hr 45mins) than her time before she was burned (1hr 50mins). The only difference was that she needed to douse herself in water every 5km, as her skin has lost the ability to keep her temperature stable. Powered by a fierce determination to prove herself, Turia Pitt is fitter than ever, embarking on a ferocious fitness program in a bid to compete in the 2016 Melbourne Ironman. The six-day-a-week program features three major planks, working on the burns victim's already impressive cardio fitness, strength and flexibility. If it sounds daunting, never fear - even Turia admits she struggles with staying motivated sometimes. 'All of us make excuses, don't we? I think it's a normal thing to do... I think it's part of being human.' THE PROGRAM . CARDIO : 2 x 2.5k swims per week and she runs around 30kms a week . STRENGTH: 2 personal training sessions per week, involving conditioning exercises including box-jumps and squats . FLEXIBILITY: 2 yoga sessions each week, 'just to get a good stretch' 'Maybe I've got something to prove... I think I am more motivated' Asked about what motivates her to keep so fit, she told Daily Mail Australia there are bigger obstacles in life than running a marathon. 'Maybe I've got something to prove.... I think I am more motivated,' she said, revealing her intense, six-day-a-week training regimen. She is hoping to compete in the 2016 Melbourne Ironman. 'Compared to what I've been through, things like doing a marathon are rather minor by comparison.' There were many dark moments during her recovery, she said - ones that required her to draw upon not only her own strength, but that of others. Turia experienced many dark moments during her recovery that required her to draw upon not only her own strength, but others as well . Her partner Michael Hoskin (left, pictured during a hike recently) has been Turia's most steadfast supporter throughout the entire ordeal . On Thursday, Turia will hold a gala to raise funds for the same charity that saved Seng's sight, Interplast. She will also provide an update on how Seng is progressing . 'There were terrible moments when I just wanted to give up,' she said. Not self-conscious: Turia Pitt has always taken pride in her appearance . Only recently she had a scare on the operating table when she stopped breathing while surgeons were attempting to install her new nose, terrifying her partner, Michael Hoskin, and mother Celestine Vaite, who been by her side throughout the entire journey. 'I guess I was really blessed because I was surrounded by a really good support team, my partner (Michael), my family, my friends, the doctors, the nurses, even my local community of Ulladulla. 'In those really hard times I did draw strength from the people around me'. Given the nature of her work with Interplast, appearance was another topic Turia dwelled upon while talking to Daily Mail Australia. She said she has always taken pride in her appearance, which hasn't changed. The burns don't concern her - instead, they are something she is accustomed to. 'Let's say you're at a party and you're self conscious and you think your arse looks big,' Turia said. 'Every time someone looks at you, you going to think, ""they're thinking my arse looks big"". 'But if you aren't really thinking that at all, you won't see it. 'I'm not looking for people who are looking at me. 'But then, if I was really self-conscious, I'd probably notice it a lot more - because I'm sure there are people who do look at me.' Years after the disaster, life is something close to normal now for Turia, who lives life according to a simple creed. 'All I do is wake up and try and get the most out of each day,' she said. 'And that's kind of what I've always done.' As for baby Seng, it is understood his big, brown eyes can see again - perhaps allowing him to live a life with the same clarity of purpose as Turia. 'All I do is wake up and try and get the most out of each day,' Turia Pitt told Daily Mail Australia. That is the simple creed by which she lives her life .","Baby Seng, from Laos, is the little boy who touched Turia Pitt's heart .

"The family of a man shot dead by a reserve deputy who confused his weapon for his Taser has slammed the gunman's decision to take a month-long vacation to the Bahamas while out on bond. Robert Bates, 73, appeared in Tulsa district court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter in the death of Eric Harris, who was killed during a botched sting on April 2. Despite the charges, the judge said that the retired insurance executive, who is out on $25,000 bond, is allowed to take a previously planned vacation to the Bahamas, NBC reported. Harris' family reacted to the decision in a statement released by their lawyer. Heading to court: Robert Bates, left, is seen walking to court on Tuesday morning with his attorney Corbin Brewster, right, before he entered his not-guilty plea in the death of Eric Harris earlier this month . 'Mistake': The 73-year-old reserve deputy claims he mistakenly pulled out his gun instead of his Taser and shot dead the man as he fled the scene of an undercover operation on April 2 . 'Whether intended or not, Mr. Bates' vacationing in the Bahamas at this time sends a message of apathy with respect to the shooting and Eric's life,' they said. 'At a time when we are still mourning the death of a loved one that he shot down in the street, Mr. Bates will be relaxing and enjoying his wealth and privilege.' It is not clear when he is leaving for the holiday but Bates will next appear in court on July 2. Bates has previously visited the Bahamas with the sheriff, Stanley Glanz, and another reserve deputy and paid for part of Glanz's trip. Bates, a Tulsa County volunteer, shot Harris, 44, after the man was confronted during an undercover gun-sale operation and ran past him. Video of the incident shows Bates chasing after Harris. In an attempt to subdue him, Bates went to grab his Taser, but was unaware he had actually pulled out his gun instead. In the video, which was released by the sheriff's office, Bates can be heard shouting 'Taser! Taser!' When the gunshot goes off, he says: 'I shot him! I'm sorry.' The fatally-wounded man can be heard saying: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man' before adding: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath!' In separate news conferences on Monday, the county sheriff and lawyers for Harris' family disagreed on whether the reserve officer should have been allowed to conduct police work. Sheriff Stanley Glanz said Bates, his longtime insurance agent and former campaign manager, had been properly trained and passed annual firearms certifications required by the state. Charged: Bates (left in his mug shot) shot Harris (pictured right) and faces four years in prison if convicted . Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' Dan Smolen, a lawyer for Harris' family, said the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office violated a number of its internal policies by letting Bates carry his personal handgun after training with another weapon. Smolen also said the department failed to keep a permanent record of Bates' training, in violation of local policies. Records Bates released during the weekend showed that the volunteer officer was trained on a .45, not the weapon used in Harris' death. Bates, who sold his insurance business for $6 million in 1999, was trained to be a Tulsa Police Department patrolman in 1964 but left in 1965. He was out of law enforcement for 35 years, returning for volunteer work in Florida in 2000 before joining the Tulsa County force in 2008 and making a number of donations to the agency. He also was Glanz' campaign manager during the 2012 election. During an appearance on the Today show last week, he apologized to Harris' family. Anger: Harris' son Aidan Fraley (pictured right with his uncle Andre Harris a week after his father's death), has said  the  police officers who allowed Bates to become a cop should be held accountable for his death . Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . 'First and foremost let me apologize to the family of Eric Harris,' he said. 'I rate this as number one on my list of things in my life that I regret... I still can't believe it happened.' He also insisted that, despite keeping his gun and Taser on different parts of his uniform, it was easy to confuse the two. 'This has happened a number of times around the country, I have read about it in the past,' Bates said. 'I thought to myself after reading several cases, 'I don't understand how this can happen'. You must believe me - it can happen to anyone.' Harris' son responded by saying that the volunteer deputy was too old to be on the police force. 'He should have been in a retirement home, not out there on the scene killing my dad,' Aidan Fraley said, NBC reported.","Tulsa reserve deputy Robert Bates was silent as he appeared in court in Tulsa on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to 2nd-degree manslaughter .

"Kenyan special forces took at least seven hours to respond to the brutal massacre at a university where nearly 150 people were killed by Islamist militants, according to reports. Elite troops were called in from Nairobi to Garissa, some 225miles from the capital, to aid in the pre-dawn attack on the university, but soldiers did not arrive until the afternoon, local media claims. The critique comes as one of the four gunmen responsible for the brutal mass-murders has been identified as a lawyer son of a Kenyan government official. Government representatives have defended the long response time, comparing fighting terrorism with being a goalkeeper as 'they only remember the one you missed'. Scroll down for video . Slow response: Kenyan elite troops were called in to aid in the pre-dawn massacre where 148 people were killed, but did not arrive until just before 2pm . Nation in mourning: A woman  cries after she has viewed the body of a relative, one of the 148 people killed in Thursday's attack on a university, at Chiromo funeral home, Nairobi . This picture of a classroom strewn with dead bodies has emerged revealing the true horror of the massacre . Kenya's elite Recce Company in Nairobi were called in as soon as the first reports of Thursday's attack emerged, which took place around 5.30am at Garissa University College. However, as troops were flown in from the capital, help did not arrive at the scene until just before 2pm, Kenyan newspaper Nation reports. 'This is negligence on a scale that borders on the criminal,' the Nation wrote in its editorial on Sunday, recalling how survivors said 'the gunmen, who killed scores of students with obvious relish, took their time.' Some journalists based in Nairobi who drove to Garissa after hearing the first reports of the attack arrived before the special forces, who came by air. Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed defended the slow response time to the massacre, where 148 people were killed, using a football analogy. Paraded: The naked bodies of the alleged attackers were driven around Garissa before the pickup truck parked at a primary school . In the primary school playground, hundreds gathered to look at the bodies of the men accused of being the attackers . 'Fighting terrorism is like being a goalkeeper,' she said. 'You have 100 saves, and nobody remembers them. They remember that one that went past you.' Interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka also dismissed the criticism. 'If you look at how we responded it was not bad at all, say, compared to Westgate,' he told the Nation. 'It takes time to assess and make the decisions, escalating it from National Security Advisory Committee to the National Security Council and then to scramble the elite units, get them to the airport and fly them to Garissa which is a two hour flight. There were many moving parts.' Earlier today, the interior ministry revealed the identity of one of the four gunmen responsible for the massacre on Thursday. Abdirahim Mohammed Abdullahi was the son of a government chief in Mandera County, Interior Ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said. The chief had reported his son missing last year and said he feared that he had gone to Somalia, said Njoka. Abdullahi graduated from the University of Nairobi with a law degree in 2013 and was viewed as a “brilliant upcoming lawyer,” according to someone who knew him. It is not clear where he worked before he disappeared last year, Njoka said. Yesterday, the decomposing bodies of Abdullahi and his three accomplices accused of carrying out the brutal massacre were paraded in front of a large crowd at a primary school today. The authorities drove the naked, bloated corpses of the four alleged terrorists around the town in a pickup truck from the mortuary to Garissa Primary School. A crowd gathers outside the morgue to catch a glimpse of the corpses of the alleged terrorists who killed 148 . Members of the public gather outside the mortuary window to view the bodies of the alleged attackers in the mortuary . People gather to catch a glimpse of the bodies of the alleged terrorists at the hospital mortuary in Garissa . Hundreds of people, some grieving for the loved ones they lost in the siege, gathered in the sweltering heat to catch a glimpse of the men who are believed to be responsible. Pictures of the crowds and the bodies piled onto the vehicle are being shared on social media. Four attackers died at Garissa, but only Abdullahi has been named. It was hoped that crowds viewing the corpses might identify them. Earlier in the day, security forces rescued Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, who spent two days hiding in a wardrobe at Garissa University College and drinking body lotion to survive. Survivor Ms Cheroitich, who hid under a pile of clothes, spoke about her ordeal following her rescue. She told reporters that she was initially too petrified to come out of the wardrobe, but a lecturer she knew eventually convinced her that police officers were not the al-Shabaab gunmen - 50 hours after the barbaric attack began. Kenyan troops searching the building were alarmed when they heard sounds coming from inside a wardrobe. A police officer said: 'She kept asking for reassurance from the security forces they were not al-Shabaab before she could come out. 'She was given milk and rushed to the Garissa hospital, where she is being observed before being given counselling.' Speaking later in hospital, the survivor said she told officers from inside the wardrobe: 'How do I know that you are the Kenyan police?' 'I was just praying to my God,' Ms Cheroitich, a Christian, said. Four other survivors from the massacre at Garissa University College were found yesterday. A photograph from inside one of the classrooms at the university has emerged, showing at least 12 bodies strewn across the floor, which is covered in blood. At least three people appear to have been huddled in fear in the corner of the room when they were murdered by the militant Islamists. Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, emerged after two days of hiding inside wardrobe at the university, and was initially too petrified to believe police officers were not al-Shabaab gunmen . Today survivor Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, who spent two days hiding and drinking body lotion to survive, was rescued . The terrorists raided the university early on Thursday morning, overwhelming guards and murdering people they suspected of being a Christian. A total of 148 people were killed in the  siege, with the gunmen shooting and beheading those who could not recite the Koran. Most of those killed were students but two police officers, one soldier and two watchmen are among the dead. Kenya's interior minister, Joseph Nkaissery said the four terrorist gunmen had strapped themselves with explosives. When officers shot at them, they exploded 'like bombs' and shrapnel injured officers. Kenyan security officials  said dozens of hostages were freed and four of the gunmen, believed to be armed with AK-47s, were killed. The Interior Ministry said five suspects had been detained, some while trying to flee to Somalia, where al-Shabaab is based. Four were Kenyans of Somali origin, and the fifth was Tanzanian, the ministry said. Officials said all three were associates of Islamist teacher Mohamed Mohamud, who is believed to have masterminded the attack. There is a £145,000 bounty on his head.

Relatives are reunited with their loved ones who survived the attack (centre) at Nyayo stadium in Kenya's capital Nairobi . A woman who survived the attack (centre) is reunited with relatives at Nyayo stadium in Nairobi today . The interior ministry said the three suspects arrested at the border had coordinated the attack. Two people were detained at the university, including a security guard and a Tanzanian man. 'We suspect the Tanzanian, who was hiding in the ceiling, was one of the combatants,' ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said. 'He had ammunition with him when he was arrested on Thursday night. We suspect the guard facilitated the entry (into the university).' In a chilling warning today, the terrorist group said more attacks like the university massacre were planned. 'Kenyan cities will run red with blood,' al-Shabab said in a statement, according to the SITE intelligence monitoring group. The militants said the barbaric attack was in retaliation for killings carried out by Kenyan troops fighting the rebels in Somalia. 'This will be a long, gruesome war of which you, the Kenyan public, are its first casualties. 'No amount of precaution or safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety, thwart another attack or prevent another bloodbath.' Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said today that those behind the attack were 'deeply embedded' in Kenya, and called on Kenyan Muslims to help prevent radicalisation. 'Our task of countering terrorism has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities,' he said in a televised speech. 'Radicalisation that breeds terrorism is not conducted in the bush at night. It occurs in the full glare of day, in madrasas, in homes, and in mosques with rogue imams.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"It's a dog-eat-dog world out there, as French restaurateurs have discovered. A report to the French government is urging eateries and customers to embrace 'le doggy bag' in a bid to reduce the staggering amount of food thrown away each year. Socialist MP Guillaume Garot, the author of the study, said while the popular US practice was previously 'unthinkable' for snooty diners and chefs, a change in attitudes could save France up to €20 billion (£14 billion) a year. French diners have previously seen doggy bags - popular in America and the UK - as 'embarrassing', but one MP has said increasing their use would stop the country wasting huge amounts of food . Chefs in France have treated takeaway bags with contempt, seeing them as 'degrading' towards their dishes . The MP has put forward 36 proposals including promoting 'doggy bags', which allow customers to bring their leftover meal home with them, as a way of stopping the rampant food waste in France, a report in The Daily Telegraph says. Throwing still-edible food away, the study continues, costs the average French  household €400 (£285) a year. Mr Garot accepts that there is a cultural obstacle stopping diners asking for takeaway bags, with proud chefs seeing it as 'degrading' towards their carefully-crafted dishes. But the scale of the food wastage problem in France means something must be done to stop the 'almost automatic' habit of waiters and cooks throwing away leftover food, he adds. Throwing away still-edible food is costing the country up to €20 billion each year, the MP's study has found . A UN report found 1.3 billion tons of food was wasted globally each year, the equivalent of a third of food produced. Cash-strapped France is attempting to save money after its position in the Eurozone worsened considerably in 2014, a year that saw higher unemployment, an increase in the public deficit and a decrease in investment. French start-up company TakeAway told the newspaper introduced the 'doggy bags' - or 'le gourmet bag', as one union boss has suggested calling them - is considered 'a bit embarrassing'. But a recent poll revealed that 75 per cent of French diners would consider making the most of the bags to enjoy the rest of their dinner later on.","Chefs should embrace 'le doggy bag' to stop edible food going in the bin .

"For a self-professed champion of women's rights, ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry has a funny way of showing it. The 28-year-old has been suspended from the network for a week after being caught on camera telling a parking lot attendant she should 'lose some weight, baby girl', adding 'I'm on television and you're in a f---ing trailer, honey'. But according to her blog, the former model is dedicated to helping women feel 'comfortable in their own skin'. In a self-aggrandizing rant, McHenry tells her readers she is 'taking a stand' against 'sexist'  commercials that focus on 'appearance alone'. It is an almost unrecognizable tone from the one she took on April 6, when she raged at towing company clerk Gina Michelle: 'Just being here makes my skin crawl... Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Women's rights champion? Britt McHenry encourages her blog readers to 'be the woman with a voice, not the sex-ed up body without one'. She said she  posted this selfie as an example of female empowerment . Pious: Just eight days before her outburst, McHenry lectured her Facebook followers on the impact of words . Vicious: ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry has been suspended for one week and could face further punishment after video surfaced of her berating an Advanced Towing employee in Arlington, Virginia . Glamorous: Originally from New Jersey, McHenry is a sideline reporter for ESPN based in Washington D.C. Pictured is Gina Michelle, the clerk abused by McHenry and told she needed to lose some weight . McHenry uses her blog post to lament the pressure put on women to appear a certain way. She describes a cheeseburger advert that features an almost naked woman, writing: 'When so many females fight for gender equality in pay and opportunity–still to this day in 2015–an advertisement like that only sets women back generations.' 'Women,' she pontificates, 'can be comfortable in their own skin... Be the woman with a voice, not the sex-ed up body without one.' Regaling her own life story, McHenry tells readers: 'Even at 18, and yes as a model once, I never fathomed resting on appearance alone. 'In a pre-Instagram era, I was more worried about putting my nose in a book rather than flaunting it (and other female assets) in a portfolio book. 'If a Champion Sportswear ad helped pay for my student loans, great. But, I wanted to be an attractive AND intelligent woman.' She closes with a rallying cry against the cheeseburger ad that inspired her diatribe: 'Put the burger down during the big game's party and pick up some chips and salsa. It will be my silent act of solidarity.' It seems her activism waned as she came face-to-face with mother-of-three Gina Michelle at the Advanced Towing Company after her car was removed from the parking lot of a Chinese restaurant in Arlington, Virginia. The verbal attack on April 6 was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office. 'I’m in the news, sweetheart, I will f-----g sue this place,' McHenry can he heard saying in the video. The parking attendant can be heard in the video warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. McHenry seems unfussed, responding: 'That’s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this. 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' The parking attendant patiently replies: 'Well lets get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money… with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' After a few more comments, including telling the woman she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos I'm on television and you're in a f-----g trailer, honey.' Finally, before walking away, McHenry says: 'Lose some weight, baby girl.' Caught red-faced: Incredibly, McHenry was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant, however continued to insult the woman's looks, education and job on-camera . Unhappy customer: Britt McHenry leaving the towing company and flipping a finger to the cameras . She's outta there: ESPN immediately responded by suspending McHenry, but only for one week . The towing company told TMZ 'she was in the wrong' but insists there are no hard feelings towards McHenry. In a statement emailed to DailyMail.com, a spokesman said: 'Parking enforcement is contentious by nature. 'At the same time, neither Gina, our lot clerk, nor our company, have any interest in seeing Britt McHenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments. 'Ms McHenry is our neighbor, and, as she said, to paraphrase, made remarks that were out of line. She is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment. 'Gina is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family. Gina holds no ill will toward Ms McHenry. 'As a small business, we saw no benefit to releasing the video, except to highlight personal attacks employees in jobs like towing, public parking enforcement and others sometimes encounter. The video was not licensed or sold to anyone.' There is now a petition to have McHenry fired from her role in Washington, D.C., slamming the sportscaster as 'derogatory, classist and body-shaming.' The Change.org petition reads: 'Currently McHenry is serving a mere 1-week suspension for her outburst. 'By retaining Britt McHenry as a prominent public figure of Sports Media, ESPN Inc. and other networks effectively send a loud public message condoning this type of cruel behavior. 'The comments captured in the video represent an unacceptable attitude of hatred for lower-income Americans and individuals whose features do not match traditional beauty standards. 'Britt McHenry lost her credibility as a professional journalist when she shamelessly broadcasted this hatred both to the victim in the video and to a global audience of thousands who now bear witness to it. 'Continuing to support Britt McHenry directly threatens not only her potential future victims, but also the integrity of ESPN, the field of American sports media, and journalism as a whole. As the video, obtained by Live Leak, spread online, ESPN, which is owned by Disney, was forced to react. A spokesman confirmed McHenry had been suspended for one week. It is unclear whether a more serious punishment will be handed down. Disney has so far refused DailyMail.com's request for a comment. McHenry, who appears impeccably groomed on camera, berated Michelle for her appearance and her job . The apology: McHenry offered up this note as the video of her awful attack spread online Thursday . The backlash: Twitter users mocked McHenry's arrogance and emphasis on appearance . A petition has been launched to see McHenry removed from the network following her outburst . Hundreds of people have reacted to the incident on Twitter as ESPN refuses to comment further . Right after the incident took place, McHenry took her Twitter account to rant about how Adanced Towing is 'corrupt'. She has since deleted the tweet. On Thursday, she turned to social media again to apologize for her actions, saying it was an 'intense and stressful moment' for her. She posted online:  'In an intense and stressful moment, I allowed my emotions to get the best of me and said some insulting and regrettable things. As frustrated as I was, I should always choose to be respectful and take the high road. I am so sorry for my actions and will learn from this mistake.' However, her apology has done little to quell the tirade of fury, and the following day weight discrimination groups began speaking out against McHenry. 'It was extremely sad,' James Zervios, vice president of marketing and communications for the Obesity Action Coalition, told the New York Daily News. 'This is not something that should be socially acceptable. 'It shows that weight bias is something that’s very common in our society.' According to The Big Lead, McHenry was eating Hunan Chinese restaurant on Wilson Boulevard in Arlington when her car was towed. Advanced Towing has been berated in the past with users complaining of double charges and unfair car removals. The firm has an F rating on the Better Business Bureau site.","ESPN reporter Britt McHenry was filmed berating tow clerk Gina Michelle .

"It was Ava Gardner's 'little London retreat' and now a slice of it could be yours for an eye-watering £500,000 per year. The Hollywood siren called the building, just a short walk from Harrods in London's exclusive Knightsbridge, home until her death in 1990. Now this newly refurbished five bedroom, five bathroom apartment gives renters the chance to walk in the footsteps of the legendary screen star. Spread over 3,054 square feet it boasts two spacious reception rooms, a study and a modern state-of-the art kitchen and breakfast room. Scroll down for video . Ava Gardner called 34 Ennismore Gardens her 'little London retreat' and now a slice of it could be yours for £10,500 per week . Through the key hole: The apartment features two stunning reception rooms and renters can boast that the buildings corridors were once graced by the screen icon . Luxury: The apartment, which is a short walk from Harrods and Hyde Park, boasts a total of five bedrooms and five bathrooms . Screen icon: Ava Gardner pictured with a cigarette in hand looks happy and relaxed in her 'little London retreat' The beauty, who was the second wife of crooner Frank Sinatra, moved to London in 1968 and made 34 Ennismore Gardens her primary residence for over 20 years. She once said of the property: 'I love the history and grandeur of my little London retreat, some say it is too big for me alone, but I love the space.' The grand apartment, in the same building where Gardner lived, is entered through a sweeping entrance hall. The master bedroom suite has walk in wardrobes and there are also two further bedroom suites and two guest bedrooms. The apartment has views of beautiful private gardens and renters will also enjoy access to the large private garden square. Reaching the pinnacle of Hollywood fame in the 1950s,  Gardner was listed 25th among the American Film Institute's Greatest Female Stars. She starred in films such as The Killers, 55 Days at Peking and The Night of the Iguana. The pin-up girl of her era, Gardner had high-profile marriages to Mickey Rooney and Frank Sinatra; and it was her marriage to Sinatra that was credited for his Oscar-winning performance in From Here to Eternity, which re-launched his singing career. The apartment in her building is being offered for rent by Tunstall Property for £10,500 per week, which equates to £546,000 per year. The homes along Ennismore Gardens have a long history, built in 1870 as part of the redevelopment of Kingston House, a Palladian mansion dating back to the 18th Century, belonging to Elizabeth Chudleigh, Duchess of Kingston. Dinning in style: Spread over 3,054 square feet it boasts two spacious reception rooms, a study and a modern state-of-the art kitchen and breakfast room .

Tasteful: Another of the apartments five bedrooms decorated in neutral shades of grey . Screen siren: The Hollywood actress was the second wife of singer Frank Sinatra. Their union only lasted two years because they were both 'high-strung people', Gardner later claimed. The mansion and its estate was later sold to William Hare, Baron of Ennismore, in 1837, but was sold off for development following his death, with the street and private gardens named to commemorate him. Once completed the five-storey homes along Ennismore Gardens, designed with Porticos and Corinthian Columns, commanded a premium of £17,000 per year. Mark Tunstall, Managing Director of Tunstall Property, commented: 'This property is just steeped in history, with corridors once graced by Ava Gardner. It is in a quiet yet well-connected pocket of prime central London and with five bedrooms provides space for all the family. 'The location is hard to beat, with Hyde Park and Harrods on the doorstep, as well as the Royal Albert Hall and museums and bistros of South Kensington a short stroll away. This home meets every requirement, providing; space, amenities and location.'","Five bed apartment in Hollywood siren's former building in Knightsbridge available to rent for £10,500 per week .

"There are some very high expectations for the JJ Abrams-directed Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens when it hits theaters on December 18. The space epic is already being predicted to rake in a global $500m on its opening weekend, according to a Tuesday article from The Hollywood Reporter. That's more than the $483m record set by the final Harry Potter film - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 - in 2011. Scroll down for trailer . The film could make over $2 billion: Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens  released its trailer on Thursday to a packed audience at California's Anaheim Convention Center; here Harrison Ford appears as Han Solo alongside Chewbacca . 'If it pleases the fans of the old movies and also appeals to kids, watch out,' box-office analyst Phil Contrino told the publication. 'Force Awakens will hit $1 billion without blinking. If it's really good, it could cross $2 billion.' Already Disney and Lucasfilm are working overtime to drum up interest in the scifi extravaganzat that's full of Stormtroopers, Jedis and lightsabers. Ancient: The opening shot of the trailer reveals a speeder on the planet Jaku, where a crashed Star Destoyer and X-Wing are buried in the sand . The second trailer was released on Thursday to massive fanfare at the Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim. The one minute 51 second trailer was unveiled by Abrams with stars Fisher, Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac and John Boyega looking on. The clip is the first time Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford, has been seen on film since 1983's Return of The Jedi. He is joined by Chewbacca at the end of the trailer and heard saying, 'Chewie, we're home.' Burned: An unknown pair of hands hold the melted mask of Darth Vader, apparently retrieved from his funeral pyre at the end of Return Of The Jedi . Familiar? A hooded unknown character with a robotic arm, possibly Luke Skywalker, is seen reaching for R2D2 . Passing it down? We see a lightsaber - which looks exacly like Luke's from A New Hope - being handed over, strongly suggesting Skywalker has had a child . Fly boys: An X-Wing squadron is seen racing along above water . Red leader: Oscar Isaac whoops as X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron, still bearing the rebel insignia on his helmet . Amboee Brand Intelligence is reporting a global debut of $533.2 million to $539.5 million. They're basing their prediction on how well the Star Wars trailer is trafficking online. And they are impressed by how it has done much better than the trailers for both Furious 7 and Fifty Shades Of Grey, which have been massive international hits. In trouble: Daisy Ridley plays Rey and John Boyega is Finn - they are seen fleeing a pursuing TIE Fighter on the Jaku . New baddie: The mysterious wielder of the much-discussed crucifix lightsaber is revealed, using the Force while wearing a mask . It is already being assumed that Force Awakens will get the widest release ever, meaning at least 4,500 locations in North America. The Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart vampire saga Twilight: Eclipse went out in 4,468 screens. Disney did not comment to the Reporter. And the competition won't be stiff either. The other films coming out that weekend are Sisters, Universal's Tina Fey-Amy Poehler comedy. New Empire: The new Stormtroopers form ranks in front of a new insignia that is reminiscent of the old Imperial one . New look: Modern TIE fighters are seen flying in formation above the desert planet, possibly in pursuit of Finn and Rey . The trailer opens on what appears to be the newly revealed desert planet Jaku (or Jakoo), as a speeder races across the sands we see an ancient downed Star Destroyer and a skeletal X-Wing, which clearly crashed there from orbit decades ago. We then see a an unknown pair of hands holding the mangled mask of Darth Vader, melted and disfigured from the Sith lord's funeral pyre at the end of Return of the Jedi. We hear a voice - believed to be Mark Hamill's - reprising a line from the 1983 film: 'The force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it. My sister has it.' Ambush: A base filled with Stormtroopers and TIE fighters comes under attack from unseen assailants . Revealed: Fans already knew Boyega's character was a Stormtrooper - or at least posed as one - since November's first teaser trailer . A hooded figure with a robotic arm, very likely Luke Skywalker, reaches out and lays a hand on R2D2 as John Williams rising score plays in the background. We then see a lightsaber changing hands between two more unseen characters, as the voice finishes: 'You have that power too' - a strong suggestion Luke Skywalker has had a child. The lightsaber itself looks exactly like the one Luke inherited from Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope, but lost when Darth Vader cut off his hand above at the climax of The Empire Strikes Back, suggesting the weapon was somehow retrieved from below Bespin's Cloud City. Upgrades: A number of ships from the old Imperial fleet are seen, including this Star Destroyer . Elite: One of the most intriguing images from the trailer was this unknown troop, wearing a black version of the Stormtrooper armour . Then in a flurry of quick scenes we see Oscar Isaac as pilot Poe Dameron flying with a squadron of X-Wings above water; His helmet and flight suit still bear the Rebel insignia from the original series. Suddenly a hooded figure swinging the much-discussed 'crucifix lightsaber' at the camera; before John Boyega and Daisy Ridley as Rey and Finn are seen fleeing a TIE fighter blasting at them from above the desert planet, while the new rolling droid BB8 trudles speedily beside them. Passenger: The rolling droid BB-8 is spotted inside the Millennium Falcon, peeking around a corner . She gets into more than she bargained for: Rey gets involved with Finn and also crosses paths with Isaac's character, it was learned . It is then we get our first proper look at the masked villain wielding the red lightsaber as he performs a Force push, while Stormtroopers mill about him in amid a fiery background. We then appear to get a glimpse of what has become of the Empire - a squadron on the new look Stormtroopers form rank in a snow-covered location beneath a new black and red insignia reminiscent of the old Imperial one, surrounded by gun batteries and parked TIE fighters, while a sole figue can be seen on a stage way in the background. Immediately we get to see the new look TIE fighters in action as a pair fly in formation above the sand, before a base filled with the former Imperial troops and falls under attack. Helping hand: This appears to be the moment Finn and Rey meet - as both actors confirmed in the Q&A they become allies in the film . Bucket of bolts: Fans got to see the Millennium Falcon in action once again, as it is pursued by two TIE Fighters . Executor? The ship is chased into the inverted ruins of a Super Star Destroyer, which also appears to have crashed on the desert planet . One of the TIE fighters seems to attack its own base, suggesting it was commandeered by whomever the troops are fighting against. As the explosions rock the base we see one Stormtrooper remove his helmet to reveal John Boyega, a plot point fans were aware of having spotted him in the uniform in the fist teaser trailer back in November. As the trailer continues, more and more evidence of surviving elements of the supposedly toppled Empire are revealed, including at least one operating Star Destroyer, although all the ships seen appear to have been modified or updated in the decades that have past since Return Of The Jedi. I have you now: The TIE fighter pilot fires upon the Millennium Falcon as it chases the ship that once belonged to Han Solo . Homage: This shot is a clear nod the pursuit of the Falcon through the second Death Star at the climax of 1983's Return Of The Jedi . One of the most intriguing shots was of a new character wearing a black version of Stormtrooper armour, perhaps some sort of elite troop, who wore a cloak over one shoulder similar to fan favourite Boba Fett. This image is followed by one of BB-8 peeking around a corner in thr interior of a ship that is surely the Millennium Falcon. During the Q&A session at the fan panel in Anaheim, John and Daisy had confirmed that their characters form an allegiance and the trailer appears to show that moment as Rey stand's above an exhausted Finn - presumably after fleeing from the Tie fighters - and extends an arm in friendship. In character: The actors in costume for the adventure; Daisy wore the same style of togs Mark Hamill wore as Luke in the first Star Wars . A new look: Several scenes from The Force Awakens were shared; this one shows Boyega in his Stormtrooper outfit . The penultimate shot of the trailer shows the Millennium Falcon - whose pilot is as yet unknown - being pursued across Jaku by a pair of TIE fighters, presumably the same ones that were chasing Finn and Rey. They chase the ship, once (and possibly still) owned by Han Solo into the belly of an enormous ruined inverted Super Star Destroyer. In one of the teasers many nods to the original films besides, the sequence mirrors the final battle above Endor when the Falcon was flown into the heart of the second Death Star. During the panel, JJ talked about his love of the franchise. 'I was 11 years old when Star Wars come out,' he said. 'That moment transported me. It was the first time a movie made me laugh that way.... the film was brilliant and had such heart and the biggest thing for me was that it had such hope. 'Shooting in Abu Dhabi was an incredible thing. Shooting Star Wars is a Western and a fairy tale... shooting in Abu Dhabi was just that,' he added. They were generous with their photos: JJ is seen here giving direction to Daisy who was atop a platform . Everyone loves a good creature: The audience cheered when JJ flashed this image where he is working with Chewbacca on set . He is still rolling along: Abrams (left) and Kennedy (right) with the tech guys who make R2D2 work .

"A California homeowners' surveillance video captured footage of three burglars who broke into their house, including one who stared directly at the camera. In the video, released by the Los Angeles Police Department, two men and one woman can be seen entering a San Fernando Valley home in the mid-afternoon. The burglars get into the house through the kitchen, peeking and even tip-toeing around as they walk through the living room of the empty home and disappear into what seems to be a hallway.

"Jailed millionaire Robert Durst pleaded not guilty Tuesday to the newest charge against him - a federal charge of possessing a gun after a felony conviction. U.S. District Judge Lance Africk set a trial date for June 22. Durst is an estranged member of the wealthy family that operates 1 World Trade Center. He also faces a murder charge in California and two state weapons charges in Louisiana - one of possessing a .38-caliber revolver after a felony conviction and one of possessing the firearm along with an illegal drug: about 5 ounces of marijuana. Claiming innocence: Suspected murderer Robert Durst appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded guilty to a new charge of gun possession. Pictured above leaving federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana in handcuffs after the court appearance . Durst pleaded guilty to two federal charges in Pennsylvania in 2004: possessing a firearm while a fugitive and while under indictment. However, his lawyers say those convictions don't make it illegal for him to carry a gun under Louisiana law. The weapons arrest has kept Durst in New Orleans even though he waived extradition to California, where he's charged in the December 2000 death of 55-year-old Susan Berman, a longtime friend -allegedly because she was going to talk to investigators about the disappearance of his first wife in 1982. He was arrested early March 15, less than 12 hours before HBO aired the final segment of 'The Jinx,' in which - off camera in a bathroom but with the microphone still live - Durst whispers, 'There it is. You're caught!' After about 10 other short sentences and disjointed phrases, he says, 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' Durst was arrested last month on suspicion of the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman. The two pictured together above . It's believed that Durst killed Berman because she was about to speak to investigators about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife Kathleen McCormack. Pictured together above . Tuesday's hearing had its own bizarre moment when prosecutor Mike McMahon asked Durst if he understood the maximum penalties he faced if convicted. Durst responded: 'And you are?' Durst's attorney and the judge then explained to him who McMahon was. Durst is being held without bail in a state prison where the Orleans Parish mental ward is located, because the sheriff's office says experts found him a suicide risk. Defense attorneys and prosecutors met with a different federal judge last week to discuss another federal matter: whether two FBI agents and a state trooper on an FBI task force should be held in contempt of court for failing to show up at a hearing last week before the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court magistrate. Federal prosecutors moved that part of the case to federal court Monday; Durst's attorneys have not filed their response and have said they would not comment until they do. Durst's lawyers say his arrest in New Orleans was timed to coincide with the conclusion of 'The Jinx.' Durst had registered at the Marriott under the name Everette Ward and was lying low while HBO aired the final chapter of his life story. Authorities said they found a passport, a head-and-chest latex mask, a handgun and marijuana in his room. His lawyers say it was searched illegally.","The former heir to the Durst real estate empire was hit with new felony gun possession charges on Tuesday .

"You could have fried an egg on David Cameron’s upper lip yesterday afternoon when he appeared in sunny Bristol. The PM was speaking in a rather peculiar building – an almost empty science park on the city’s outskirts, its round atrium area filled with party activists. The space was uncomfortably hot and Mr Cameron was looking straight into a merciless, piercing, armpit-moistening sun. The prime ministerial upper lip was soon glistening. Attack of the sweats! David Cameron worked up a sweat as he made a visit to Poole in Dorset and sunny Bristol. Pictured: The Prime Minister speaks with Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota over lunch in a sun-drenched garden . It was such a glorious bank holiday, why on earth did Tory high command not scrap their plans, strip down to shirts and chinos and campaign on the beach at Weston-super-Mare? They might at least have found some swing voters there. But there is something clinical, immutable, rigid, unspontaneous so far about this Tory campaign. Well, all the parties’ campaigns, really. Strategists with precious plans have plotted every minute of every low-risk day and the politicians look more remote from the electors than ever. Mr Cameron was appearing alongside George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, both of them in weekday suits. On some news-management grid many moons ago it had been decided that tax was to be the theme of the day. I suppose no one guessed it might be high-summerish weather. Bank holidays are usually washouts. And so tax remained the dish du jour. The day was hailed as ‘Money Back Monday’ because it was the start of the financial year and the new, more generous tax allowances for the low-paid meant an extra £600 in people’s pockets. Mr Cameron had spent the morning in Poole, Dorset (where veteran Lib Dem MP Annette Brooke is retiring) and apparently ate a hot dog while he was there. One of the reporters who had been on his campaign bus said he had met ‘at least two voters’. He arrived at the Bristol and Bath Science Park at 4.40pm. As his battle bus approached the destination, one of his police bodyguards made plain his feelings by being spectacularly sick, poor soul. Perhaps the copper had been food taster for the hot dog. Everyone getting off the bus looked a bit green. The audience had been waiting for some time, broiling slowly in the building’s atrium. What a soulless place it was, of antiseptic design with bleached wood and long, lifeless corridors. Vast windows. An airport-style exterior. We could have been anywhere in the world – the middle of Texas, the plains of central France, or at a yet-to-open business hotel in Bulgaria. Prime Minister David Cameron and George Osborne make a speech at the Bristol and Bath Science Park . During his Bristol visit, Mr Cameron read a speech and said there was a ‘moral’ case for the Tories’ policies . Bristol has a handful of seats, local Tory MPs being Chris Skidmore, Charlotte Leslie and Jack Lopresti. Might it not have made more sense to hold a rally underneath Clifton suspension bridge – somewhere that at least had a resonance with the city? A tanned Mr Cameron dutifully made his prepared speech, saying that there was a ‘moral’ case for the Tories’ economic policies. Fetch that, Mr Archbishop of Canterbury. It was ‘frankly immoral to spend money like it grows on trees’. He said he and the Tories would spend money on ‘your family, your future’ rather than on ‘bureaucracy or bloat or the latest crackpot Government scheme’. This innovative use of ‘bloat’ as a noun was repeated three times. Don’t vote bloat. Maybe it should be their new slogan. After ten minutes he let George Osborne make a speech. Eeek. George stepped into the glare and you have seldom seen a man look so deathly pale. Shades of the sepulchre on Easter morning. A brief session of questions saw Mr Cameron being asked about recent Lib Dem eruptions – Nick Clegg calling Mr Osborne ‘a very dangerous man’ and Danny Alexander alleging that the Tories are not interested in helping the poor. Mr Cameron said it was inevitable that ‘you’ll find the minor parties saying increasingly desperate things’. He was unfazed by ‘the odd noise-off from a deputy’. Or should that be noise-off from an odd deputy?","David Cameron enjoyed visit to Bristol with Chancellor George Osborne .

"Arrest: Timothy Rogalski allegedly repeatedly called Sandy Hook Elementary School on Tuesday . A man has been arrested for repeatedly calling Sandy Hook Elementary School and accusing staff members of staging the 2012 school massacre. Timothy Rogalski, from Wallingford, Connecticut, called the school on Tuesday morning and left four messages on its office answerphone. The fifth time he called, he spoke to an administrative assistant. In the calls, the 30-year-old accused staff of being behind the December 14, 2012 shooting that left 20 children and six female educators dead, according to police in Monroe. He also said the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2014 were fake, police said. Authorities traced the calls back to the home Rogalski shares with his father, about 40 miles from where the 2012 attack unfolded, and he was arrested. 'I don't think I said anything that horrible,' Rogalski said at a court appearance on Wednesday, NBC Connecticut reported. He has been charged with harassment and disorderly conduct and is being held on $2,500 bond. He was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation and not to contact anyone at the school. He will next appear in court on April 22. Arrest: The calls were traced to his home in Wallingford, pictured, which is about 40 miles from where the shooting unfolded in Newtown in 2012. He was taken into custody and charged . Rogalski allegedly made the calls to Sandy Hook Elementary, which is operating temporarily in Monroe as a new school is built to replace the old one, and two other nearby schools. The original site of the school was demolished a year after the shootings. The gunman's home, where he shot dead his mother before going on the killing spree at the school, was also torn down in earlier this year. Rogalski's arrest does not mark the first time threatening calls have been made about the killings. In the days following the 2012 school shooting, Wilfrido Cardenas Hoffman, 31, looked up Newtown residents' phone numbers from his home in Venezuela and made more than 90 calls. Authorities said that in a few calls, Cardenas claimed to be the Sandy Hook shooter, Adam Lanza, and threatened to kill the person he had phoned. Terror: Responders gather at the scene of the mass school shooting in Newtown on December 14, 2012. The shooting left 20 children and six educators dead, as well as the gunman's mother . 'This is Adam Lanza. I'm gonna (expletive) kill you. You're dead. You're dead. You hear me? You're dead,' he said, according to authorities. Deirdre Daly, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, said the conduct of Cardenas was reprehensible. 'These threatening calls, just two days after the tragedy, compounded the collective suffering of all of the citizens of Newtown and needlessly stressed law enforcement resources at a critical time,' she said. He was arrested in 2014, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year in prison.","Timothy Rogalski 'called the school five times and accused school staff of staging the shooting that left 20 children and six educators dead'

"Sellers are now wildly over-valuing their houses by around £74,000 – forcing buyers to barter them down, analysis shows. A study found that Britons selling their properties refuse to admit the housing market has cooled and mistakenly believe they are sitting on a goldmine. Buyers must now increasingly treat asking prices as a starting point for negotiations as sellers demand silly prices, it is claimed. Sellers are now wildly over-valuing their houses by around £74,000 – forcing buyers to barter them down, analysis shows . While average sale prices are about £207,000 in the UK, advertised asking prices are typically £74,000 higher at £281,000. Researchers analysed sold price data from the Office for National Statistics, Land Registry, Halifax and Nationwide and compared it to asking prices on the UK’s largest property website Rightmove. Online estate agent eMoov said many sellers still believed they were selling at the market’s peak and were routinely over-pricing their property, encouraging buyers to put in cheeky offers. A report said: ‘Previous high demand in many areas caused house prices in England and Wales to soar, with many sellers now looking to cash in as a result of a particularly buoyant market. ‘But as the market begins to cool, those looking to sell are doing so at increasingly unrealistic prices.’ Last year, house prices rose by 8 per cent, according to Halifax, peaking at 10 per cent over the summer. But forecasts suggest prices will grow at a fraction of this rate this year. The study said a recent fall in activity in the housing market had also prompted some estate agents to over-value properties in a bid to secure custom from depleted numbers of sellers. It said some agents ‘overvalue a property on purpose to win the business and get the seller on their books’, knowing the price must later be knocked down significantly before it sells. Russell Quirk, of eMoov.co.uk, said: ‘Unfortunately it’s a common place practice in the high street sector. ‘The agent is driven by a percentage fee so they will overprice a property to try their luck, win the business and increase their profit margins. A study found that Britons selling their properties refuse to admit the housing market has cooled and mistakenly believe they are sitting on a goldmine . ‘Understandably the seller opts for the agent that claims they can get the highest price, as we are all motivated, to some extent, by money. ‘Then as regular as clockwork the agent will ring them a few weeks down the line and ‘advise’ on a lower asking price in order to sell. ‘But it is, in part, down to the seller. ‘If someone has it in their head they should achieve x amount, they will list at this regardless of what advice they receive.’ A survey of 2,000 sellers in England and Wales, carried out by eMoov, found that that more than half of sellers would list their property at a price recommended by their agent. But over a third said they would list at a higher price than this, while only one in 20 said they would go lower than the recommendation. A third of sellers also said getting the highest price was the most important factor, while a quarter said their priority was securing a buyer with stable finances. A seventh of respondents said not missing out on purchasing a new home they liked was the most important issue. Andrew Montlake, of mortgage brokers Coreco Partners, said: ‘Estate agents say their biggest battle at the moment is trying to get sellers to agree to a realistic figure because they are reluctant to accept that prices have come down. ‘At the start of last year, we had the perfect storm. The economy was recovering and buyers and sellers who had done nothing for five years leapt into action. ‘Lenders wanted to lend and the market went crazy, with almost every property receiving a ridiculous number of offers. ‘But we are now in a more sensible market and the buyers are back in control. There is no longer the same demand.’ He added: ‘The difficulty is trying to get vendors to put their home on the market for a realistic price to get buyers through the door. ‘Once they have interest in their property, they may find the price is pushed up if buyers enter into a bidding war.’","Study shows UK sellers refuse to admit the housing market has cooled .

"North Charleston police are facing growing accusations that killer cop Michael Slager would have got away with a cover up had a bystander video not emerged - as questions emerge over his colleagues' conduct after the shooting. Seven of Slager's fellow cops responded to his call forback-up after the shooting - as handcuffed Walter Scott lay dead or dying with five bullet wounds to the back. But the fact that his wounds were to the back do not feature in subsequent accounts of the shooting given to the media, or in the force's incident report filed after the shooting. Officers also told an internal report that they gave Scott CPR, but the video only shows them checking his pulse and standing over his body. One officer is also present when Slager picks up an object - allegedly his Taser - and puts it near Scott's body. Scroll down for video . Questions: Officer Clarence Haberdashem searches Walter Scott's handcuffed body in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. He later told colleagues that he administered CPR . Scott's father said of the incident: 'It would have never come to light [had video not emerged]. They would have swept it under the rug, like they did with many others.' Slager's former attorney had initially claimed that the officer fired on Scott during a struggle for his Taser and had felt threatened. 'When confronted, Officer Slager reached for his Taser — as trained by the department — and then a struggle ensued,' David Aylor said. 'The driver tried to overpower Officer Slager in an effort to take his Taser. [He] felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon.' On Wednesday North Charleston Mayor Keith Sumney refused to answer a question on Slager's fellow officers' culpability, saying it would be addressed in the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division [SLED] investigation. There are also questions over discrepancies between responding officers' version of events in an internal incident report and what the witness video shows. It is not known what accounts those officers gave to the subsequent SLED investigation. The video of the shooting shows Officer Clarence Haberdasham was the first to arrive on scene as Scott lay handcuffed on the ground. As Haberdasham arrives, Slager runs back to position where he fired the fatal shots and appears to retrieve a dark object - claimed to be his Taser - and places it next to Scott's body. Haberdasham dons a pair of blue gloves, checks Scott's pulse, goes through his pockets and speaks on his radio and then walks away. Radio records show that an officer reported that Scott had gunshot wounds to the chest and right side and was 'unresponsive'. He later added that the vicitm had wounds to the back. Both Slager and Haberdasham stand over Scott's body, which remains handcuffed and face down. The same officer's account of events as reported in the NCPD incident report obtained by BuzzFeed is two sentences. The second reads: 'I attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and directing the best route for EMS and fire to get to the victim faster.' Aftermath: Officer Slager is pictured standing over Walter Scott and feeling for a pulse after he put the man's fallen body in handcuffs. According to police reports, officers performed CPR on the 50-year-old father - but the cop was not filmed giving any medical assistance . POLICE VERSION . Police officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday. He said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light. He said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager. The officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement. According to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott. At that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said. He added that his actions were in line with procedure. Police then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser.' His department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim. WHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS . Slager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back. The footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body. Footage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him. It is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse. A black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid. They are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim. The report is signed off by Sergeant James Gann. He states: 'I arrived on scene and observed that Officer Haberdasham was administering first aid to the driver. I exited my vehicle and assisted Officer Haberdasham with first aid and CPR to the driver.' He says they continued to give CPR until EMS arrived and Scott was pronounced dead. There is no evidence in Feidin Santana's video that Scott received CPR. A second video of the scene shows two other police officers arriving at the scene and getting out a medical kit. But they do not give CPR. Six other officers' version of what happened after the shooting is recorded in the incident report. They were: R. Terrell, J Bariss, M Cooper, R Killin, B Williams, and Sgt Webb. They all say that they heard Slager's call for help and arrived at the scene later. Gann says the crime scene was handed over to SLED, who then concluded their crime scene investigation that day. Edward Bryant III, president of the North Charleston NAACP, also told the Los Angeles Times that he suspects North Charleston cops have covered up other shootings. He said; 'This incident fits a pattern of abuse that has gone on for years. There is a code of conduct to cover their behinds. We call it Code Blue.' Marc Moria, President of the president of the National Urban League, told the Washington Post: 'But for this video, this would have been another coverup, another fabrication, another lie told by a police officer when the police officer was clearly in the wrong.' The discrepancies were also discussed on MSNBC's Morning Joe this morning. Host Joe Scarborough said: 'That cop is two feet away when he dropped the taser next to the dead body. I'm sorry, what cop is okay with that?' Mika Brzezinski added: 'There should be more charges' After Officer Michael Slager was charged with murder on Tuesday and terminated from the North Charleston Police on Wednesday, his department released his personnel file. Some 100 pages including his job application, training records, firearm test scores and work appraisals were published online. Among the details were that Slager had graduated from Lenape High School in Medford, N.J, in 2001 and was a waiter at an Italian restaurant before he joined the U.S. Coast Guard in 2003. He spent six years with the Coast Guard working as a mechanic and engineer and then became involved in security on board vessels. He was hired by the North Charleston Police Department in December 2009 and attended the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy for a nine-week training course. Major Florence McCants told Yahoo News that Slager 'didn't create any issues nor was he an award winner in any of the categories'. Slager also took course in first-aid and use of a Taser, according to his personnel records.","Growing questions over the conduct of Michael Slager's fellow officers .

The pair often go to shows and museums in New York City, but relatives have filed a missing person report after Emily did not return to her East Hampton school from Spring Break . Relatives of the family, who own a horse farm on Long Island's North Fork, reported them missing on Tuesday. 'She said she was going to Manhattan for Easter,' Iona's mother Diana Malcolmson, 80, told Daily Mail Online. The grandmother, who lives in nearby Shelter Island, New York, said police told her that surveillance footage from the parking garage showed Mrs Costello and Emily walking away from their car on March 30, holding suitcases and laughing. She said that she spoke regularly with her daughter, but had not heard about any plans for extended vacations. Iona Costello also has family in England, though they have not heard from her, according to Southold Local. While trips into New York were fairly normal, Emily being out of school is not. The ninth grader had been scheduled to return to Ross School in East Hampton from her Spring Break this past Tuesday. Iona Costello's husband George, the co-owner of Costello Marine in Greenport, died from a heart attack in 2012 . Police said that they do not expect foul play and have no hard evidence suggesting that the Costellos may be in danger . The mother had told workers at her farm that she would be 'back on Tuesday' but did not return on March 31st, April 7th or April 14th. Workers at the horse farm say it is strange for Mrs Costello not to be in contact with them about raising the animals. Southold police Chief of Police Martin Flatley told Daily Mail Online that his force do not expect any foul play. He said that he does not currently have any hard evidence to point to the mother and daughter being in danger. Relative Jane Costello said that calls to both Iona's and Emily's phones go straight to voicemail. Police still say they do not expect any foul play in the case, though workers at the Costello's North Fork farm say that she would normally be in contact about the business's affairs . Workers at the farm, which also includes cows, said that Mrs Costello told them she would be 'back on Tuesday' Mrs Costello was a well-known equestrian in eastern Long Island, according to the East Hampton Star. Iona's husband George, co-owner of construction company Costello Marine in Greenport, died at the age of 63 a heart attack in 2012. The pair had married in 1999. It is not believed that the Costellos owned any property in New York, according to Chief Flatley, though authorities are now looking at a wider circle of relatives that may know about their movements in the city. A spokesperson for the NYPD said that city police are working in conjunction with Southold officers, but have not yet received any sightings of the mother and daughter. Southold Police have asked anyone who sees Mrs Costello or her daughter to contact them at 631-765-2600.","Iona Costello, 51, and her daughter Emily, 14, missing since late March .

"The last thing many people would expect to discover when delving into their gran's past, is their successful career as a pin-up girl. Helen Dunn, 78, wasn't ever expecting to relive her daring past, but was surprised when she opened a copy of the Sunday Mercury newspaper to find a photo of herself starring back. The mother-of-two and grandmother, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, was flicking through the newspaper when she spotted herself on the cover of a raunchy lads' mag from 1955. Helen Dunn, 78, was shocked to discover her cover images for vintage lads mag Span, when she opened the Sunday Mercury newspaper . Vintage beauty: The grandma, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, was only 17 years old at the time of the cover shoot . The cover was featured as a part of collector Tim Beddow's 'antiques rudeshow' collection of 700 vintage men's mags, the Birmingham Mail reports. And there Dunn was - under her model pseudonym, Sherry Morris - on the cover of top-shelf British magazine, Span. The cover image shows Dunn, who was just 17 years old at the time, perched seductively on a stool with her legs slightly crossed. Naughty or nice: Helen made all her own costumes for the raunchy shoot for Span, including the fur muff (pictured right) 'I was always outgoing' - Helen didn't mind the risqué nature of the shoot, in which she posed seductively for the camera . The 78-year-old wears an off-the-shoulder top, and her stockings and suspenders are in full display. In an interview with the Birmingham Mail, the glamorous gran admitted that she was shocked to see the images. She said: 'When I saw the picture I was absolutely shocked. 'I shouted, 'That's me! I think it's great, I have no secrets.' Back in the day, Dunn had a brief stint as a model, before she went on to marry a professional footballer three years later: Manchester United's Alan Dunn. Dunn (pictured right) went on to marry Manchester United footballer Alan Dunn (left), just three years after the cover shoot . The grandmother recalls her modelling days with a fondness, and remembers the shoot clearly. Helen had even made her own outfit, including the fur muff. She had posed in the garden of local photographer Royston Campbell after a friend of Helen sent him images. 'He was a gentleman, a very nice man,' she recalls. 'Nothing iffy about him at all. 'I always made my own outfits, even the umbrellas. The picture was originally for a Christmas calendar. 'Back in the day, I wasn't bad looking and didn't have a bad figure' - Helen looks back on her modelling days . 'I suppose the magazine was looked on as a little risqué, but it really didn't bother me. I didn't think about it. I was always outgoing. When breaking the news to her two grown-up children, Helen had no worries about how her former career would be perceived. She admitted: 'You know what? They think it's great.' 'Back in the day, I wasn't bad looking and didn't have a bad figure.'","Helen Dunn opened Sunday Mercury newspaper, saw raunchy pics .

"It was the maths problem designed for 14-year-olds that baffled people around the world. For those who did not manage to work out the cryptic clues that were designed to lead them towards the fictional Cheryl's birthday, then the answer was July 16. Those who were able to reason their way to this answer followed a series of logical steps that allowed them to rule out the other dates given as part of the question. The question, 'So when is Cheryl’s birthday?' was one of 25 questions set in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad. At first, it appears impossible to answer without more information but pictured is the method used to work it out . The question, 'So when is Cheryl’s birthday?' was one of 25 questions set in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad. It asked: Albert and Bernard just became friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates: May 15, May 16, May 19, June 17, June 18, July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15 and August 17. Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively. The puzzle asked: Albert and Bernard just became friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates. May 15, May 16,  May 19 . June 17, June 18 . July 14, July 16 . August 14, August 15, August 17 . Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively. Albert: I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know that Bernard does not know too. Bernard: At first I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know now. Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl’s birthday is. So when is Cheryl’s birthday? Albert said: 'I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know that Bernard does not know too. Bernard said: 'At first I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know now.' Albert said: 'Then I also know when Cheryl’s birthday is.' To reach the answer, it is possible to work through the information both men known to rule out nine of the dates in a number of steps. First, we know Cheryl has already told Albert the month of her birthday, and Bernard the day. Each of the men does not know what the other has been told. So, for Albert to be 'certain' that Bernard cannot know the answer - as suggested in the first statement he makes - we can deduct that the birthday cannot possibly be in May or June. This is because in the months of May and June there are numbers (dates) that only occur once across the four months - namely May 19 and June 18. If Albert had been given May or June as the month, there is no way he could be sure Bernard did not already know the birthday as  Bernard might have been the number 18 or 19. For Albert to be 'certain' that Bernard doesn't know, Albert must have been given a month that does not contain one of these 'unique' dates - i.e. July or August. The problem was posted on Facebook by ‘Hello Singapore’ television presenter Kenneth Kong, and went viral as people posted their various solutions to the problem. It was set for 14-year-olds in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiads (SASMO), which were held on April 8 (stock image of exam room shown) Albert's disclosure now gives Bernard the clue he needs to work out the birthday for himself. Bernard only knows the number of Cheryl’s birthday, but from Albert’s statement he has now also ruled out both May and June. This is because he realises Albert has ruled out May and June because of the 'single number' aspect above. As Bernard says he knows the date, we can whittle it down further to three dates by ruling out the numbers that appear in duplicate. If Cheryl had told Bernard that her birthday fell on the 14th of the month, then he could not have worked out the date at this stage. However, as he states that he now knows the date, we can rule out July 14 or August 14. This leaves just three dates to chose from - July 16, Aug 15 and Aug 17. Following Bernard's statement, Albert is then apparently also able to deduce the date of Cheryl's birthday. This means her birthday must be the only remaining date in the month he was originally told. Given that there are two dates left in August and one in July, it has to be the July date. So the answer is July 16. Organisers of SASMO said the question was set to filter out the most intelligent of participants. This year around 28,000 students from countries across the world including Singapore, China and the UK took the test .

"Property prices are predicted to fall by up to 10 per cent in some states with economists tipping a housing surplus in 2017. In a new report, Goldman Sachs predicts population growth will slow to 1.25 per cent over the next three years due to low birth rates, high death rates and falling net migration. This is significantly lower than widely-used Australian Bureau of Statistics population predictions of between 1.7 and 1.8 per cent - which Goldman Sachs analysts Tim Toohey and Andrew Boak label as 'too optimistic'. This will create an oversupply and see property prices fall by between 5 and 10 per cent in markets where construction supply has been strong – particularly inner-city Melbourne and Perth – according to BIS Shrapnel managing director Robert Mellor. Scroll down for video . A new housing development at 88 Alfred Street in Milsons Point, on the lower north shore of Sydney, with panoramic views of the harbour . Sydney will be one of the only markets not to be hit by an oversupply of housing in the next three years, according to economists . Property prices are predicted to fall by up to 10 per cent in some states with economists tipping a housing surplus in 2017 . 'It is correct to talk about the markets going to go from chronic undersupply to the fact there will be excess supply developing in a number of markets,' Mr Mellor told Daily Mail Australia. 'One market we've been concerned about for quite a long time is inner city apartments in Melbourne, such as in Docklands, Southbank and the CBD. 'While there might be a shift in demand patterns with renters wanting to live closer in, it's not going to be sufficient. 'Supply will swamp the amount of demand and lead to excess supply, and you're going to find a substantial reduction in rents and the risk of falling values.' Mr Mellor said there is a likelihood Perth, Canberra and Adelaide will see declines. 'Perth is seeing a substantial turnaround in supply at the moment and a reduction in underlying demand,' he said. 'Even in markets like Adelaide construction has been relatively strong and as a result there could be some excess supply. Goldman Sachs predicts population growth will slow to 1.25 per cent  due to low birth rates, high death rates and falling net migration . Property prices could fall by between 5 and 10 per cent in markets where construction supply has been strong . This new housing development is at 8 Bank Street in the West End, Brisbane. Brisbane will also be relatively stable, economists say . 'Canberra has a significant excess supply because of overbuilding of inner city apartments.' He added that there was no risk of oversupply in Sydney. 'In Sydney the underlying level of demand is so strong relative to supply, and the fact this is a market where there hasn't been enough building. There is very little risk of excess supply developing in this market in the next three years to five years. 'Brisbane does have some risk that problems could occur but then again the timing of that is going to be dependent on how much more supply comes into that market over the next couple of years.' Goldman Sachs forecast a 75,000 underlying surplus of established homes across Australia by the end of 2017. The report predicts that Australia's population will be 530,000 smaller ABS estimates for 2017. 'It is correct to talk about the markets going to go from chronic undersupply to the fact there will be excess supply developing in a number of markets,' BIS Shrapnel managing director Robert Mellor said . In Sydney the underlying level of demand is so strong relative to supply, and  there hasn't been enough building activity, he said . Goldman Sachs forecast a 75,000 underlying surplus of established homes across Australia by the end of 2017 . This is tipped to reduce potential economic growth from 2.9 per cent to 2.5 per cent for the 2015-2017 period. 'A lower ""potential"" rate of economic growth suggests disinflationary pressures will stabilise through 2015 and support the case for interest rate rises through 2017, and the RBA will likely be in the position of lifting interest rates into an oversupplied housing market,' Mr Toohey and Mr Boak write. 'Australia will need 105,000 fewer homes by the end of 2015 relative to that suggested by [ABS figures], 165,000 fewer homes by the end of 2016 and 215,000 fewer homes by the end of 2017,' the report states. Australia's population growth is set to slow sharply through 2015, according to Goldman Sachs, with births declining 'at the fastest rate on record' and uncertain labour markets affecting net migration. 'We also suggest the rate of growth of deaths will easily double its historical average over the coming decade as the sheer number of individuals moving into age brackets with higher mortality rates swamps any further extension to average years lived,' the report states.

"Two Ukip council candidates have been taken to school by a teacher who covered their sloppy election leaflet in corrections - but they claim it is a dirty tricks campaign. Suzy Howlett, 54, who specialises in teaching foreign-born children English, has embarrassed husband and wife team Derek Tanswell and Sharon Snook over their spelling, punctuation and grammar. In one section Mr Tanswell and Ms Snook promise that Ukip will 'take back control of our boarders' - so the teacher wrote in red: 'I think you mean borders, not residents of a school or guest house'. Scroll down for video . Back to school: A teacher has taken her red pen to an error-strewn Ukip leaflet that landed on her doormat . Back to basics: The teacher picked up on the use of boarders and wrote: 'I think you mean borders, not residents of a school or guest house' In their leaflet the councillors  also tell prospective voters: 'If you vote Ukip your get Ukip' - so the marker wrote: 'You'll?'. One handwritten note about the leaflet's opening paragraph says: 'This 'sentence' is long and obscure. It needs some punctuation if it is to make sense'. The Ukip candidates, from Frome, Somerset, defected to Nigel Farage's party two weeks ago and hope to be re-elected in May, having left the Lib Dems to improve their chances. Expert: Suzy Howlett, 54, who specialises in teaching foreign-born children English, took her red pen to the leaflet and sent it to her children . Mr Tanswell today said his former party have 'hacked' his emails for information to create a slapdash  leaflet to scupper their election hopes, and has called in police. However,  a party source has suggested the leaflet is genuine. He said: 'They had to rewrite everything and it looks like they didn't have time to spell check it.' Mrs Howlett, a specialist teacher with 32 years' experience, told MailOnline she enjoyed a 'happy two minutes' correcting their work. Using a red pen she highlighted the incorrect use of words, lack of apostrophes, flabby language, poor spellings and use of Americanisms. Their error-strewn Ukip leaflet has been shared thousands of times online. Mrs Howlett said: 'I marked it during a happy two minutes last night. I had heard about the leaflet from friends and my husband brought home a copy and straight away I told him I was eager to take a red pen to it. 'The part about borders - or boarders -  really made me laugh. I took a picture of my work and my children, Lucy and George, were very amused by it. They posted it to their friends, and it took off. 'I teach children who speak English as an additional language and advise other teachers about how to help them. There is no shame in having difficulties with spelling, punctuation and grammar. Some of my nearest and dearest have a few issues at times, and I am certainly not poking fun at dyslexia. 'But what I am saying is that there is a problem when people don't recognise their own shortcomings. 'I have not met the candidates, but the leaflet suggests that if you can't check something like this properly, how can you run something properly if you were to be elected. 'I am most certainly not going to vote Ukip, absolutely not, but I will not say who I will be voting for. 'I won't discuss (Ukip) policies, I will just say that the children I work with are a delight, and some of them could teach Mr Tanswell a thing or two about apostrophes'. Election campaign: Derek Tanswell and Sharon Snook, left and right,  defected to Nigel Farage's party two weeks ago and hope to be re-elected in May . Hint: This bullet point lacks the necessary apostrophe in one of more than 20 corrections . Lost in translation: A key section to persuade voters to back them next month also backfired . Changes: Mrs Hewlett suggested in her red notes 'try not to keep using apostrophes for plurals' A picture of the annotated leaflet has spread across the internet after it was posted on Reddit by a user who said a mother of a friend had marked it after finding it on her doormat. The leaflet also boasted about Snook and Tanswell's campaigning which led to the creation of ten free parking spaces at the local Cattle Market car park. Mr. Tanswell says the Liberal Democrats have put out the leaflet to 'stitch him up'. He said 'They have been hacking into my emails, the Liberal Democrats. They've hacked it all and I have the police looking at it now. 'It's the Liberal Democrats who are doing it all. They've hacked into my emails, they've basically got hold my stuff, they are producing it, they are sending it out, they are doing everything they can. 'I'm receiving about 20, 30 phone calls before 12 o'clock today threatening to kill me. The police are on to all of that'. Mr. Tanswell, 48, who runs a plumbing and heating company, added: 'I used to be a Liberal Democrat councillor. 'About a month ago, I left the Liberal Democrats to go UKIP and obviously a lot of them don't like it, so they are producing stuff like [the flyer] and putting it out and putting my name to it. 'I spoke to the police this morning. They are worried about it because people are making threats to kill me and stuff. Supportive: Mrs Howlett says she was not poking fun, adding: 'There is no shame in having difficulties with spelling, punctuation and grammar' 'They believe the propaganda from the national parties, like the Liberal party are saying that UKIP are racist. That's not true. They don't like it. 'I was a Liberal Democrat councillor and I've gone to UKIP - they don't like that. These people are very vindictive. 'I don't know who the death threats are coming from but the police are investigating it now. 'The Liberal Democrats have put all that s*** out about me. They've stuck a load of stuff on my Facebook, they hacked into that.' A Liberal Democrat spokesman said this afternoon: ‘The idea that the Liberal Democrats had anything to do with Cllr Tanswell’s absurd allegations is categorically untrue. 'Liberal Democrats take the accusation that the party was involved in illegal activity such as the hacking of emails seriously, and the local party is exploring its options.’ Mrs Howlett asked MailOnline to include a link to the charity Against Malaria, recommended by the charity Effective Altruism, which her son George, 24, volunteers for.","Election candidates failed to check spelling, punctuation and grammar .

"Odds on the second royal baby being called Sam have been slashed, following the success of Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree, the Duchess' close friend . Prince George's brother or sister could be called Sam - after the jockey that helped the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge rekindle their romance. Bookmakers have slashed odds on the name Sam - which could be used for Samuel or Samantha - being chosen for the name of the second royal baby. It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend. The 33-year-old amateur jockey was once dubbed 'The Royal Matchmaker' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance during their brief split in 2007. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have publicly insisted that even they do not know what sex their second child will be. Ladbrokes confirmed they received a recent flurry of bets following Mr Waley Cohen's high-profile win on Radjhani Express on Friday in Aintree's Crabbies Topham Chase - prompting their odds to tumble from 66/1 to 20/1. David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 'With Sam Waley-Cohen's close links to the Royals it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with Sam as their answer for the baby's name.' Simon Clare, from bookmakers Coral, confirmed they too have had no choice but reduce their odds on 'Sam' in recent days because of the popularity of the name. He explained: 'We have slashed his odds from 66/1 to 40/1 . 'Given how close the Duchess of Cambridge is to Sam Waley-Cohen we are also seeing money for Sam or Samuel at 150/1 and Samantha at 200/1 to be their second baby's name.' Scroll down for video . The new prince or princess will be fourth in line to the throne but, unlike Prince George, he or she is not expected to rule as sovereign. The baby will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild. Alice is still the favourite at 3/1 followed closely by Elizabeth and Charlotte at 5/1 and 6/1 respectively, according to Ladbrokes on Sunday afternoon. At the moment odds have been slashed for female names, because of widespread speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to a sister for Prince George. The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth later this month, with a rumoured due date of April 25 . Mr Waley-Cohen, pictured in 2014, rode to success at Aintree on Friday and in the Grand National . Mr Waley-Cohen, who has been a close confidante of the Duchess of Cambridge for years, rode Oscar Time to 15th place in yesterday's Grand National. In 2011 he was invited to the couple's Westminster Abbey wedding. And in 2012 Mr Waley-Cohen- whose relatives include Shell Oil founder, the 3rd Viscount Bearsted - made the Duchess guest of honour at his nuptials to party-organiser Bella Ballin. Mr Waley-Cohen, a part-time jump-jockey and healthcare businessman, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on 'Long Run' The royal baby is expected to arrive later this month. There is speculation the Cambridges' second born might arrive on the Queen's birthday on April 21 or even the Duke and Duchess' fourth wedding anniversary on April 29. Other reports suggest the due date could be April 25. The Duchess of Cambridge is to return to the Lindo wing at St Mary's Hospital in London to give birth. as she did with Prince George (pictured) That date would tally with the fact that the Duchess' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on March 27 in South London, suggesting late April is more likely than mid-April. The Duchess' second pregnancy was announced on September 8 when she was thought to be just six weeks pregnant. She has been staying at the couple's new country home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall. But she is expected to return to London soon as she intends to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, where a natural birth costs up to £10,000. Her team will be led by Guy Thorpe-Beeston, Surgeon Gynaecologist to the Royal Household. Waley-Cohen is a Celebrity Ambassador for The Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT) and was famously pictured with the Duchess of Cambridge at the Roller Disco he organised to raise money for a ward in memory of his brother.","The royal baby could be called Sam, after Duchess of Cambridge's friend .

"David Cameron today announced plans to give millions of workers three days paid leave a year to do volunteer work. The Prime Minister said he will amend the Working Times regulations so for three days people can volunteer or serve as a school governor, and get paid in addition to their 28 days of paid holiday. But business leaders criticised the move as heavy-handed government intervention', amid doubts about how the policy would be paid for. Scroll down for video . Happy handshake: The Prime Minister met staff and volunteers at the Age UK Day Centre in Plymouth today . Prime Minister David Cameron's Big Society good deeds scheme will only affect firms with 250 or more staff . The policy will apply to workers at firms with at least 250 staff - an estimated 10 million in the private sector and five million in the public sector. Volunteers would be able to take the time to volunteer in a block or flexibly. Announcing the policy Mr Cameron said: 'This election is about building a better future for our children and grandchildren. The foundation stone of that better future is our economic security. But Conservatives know the society we build on top of that is just as important too. 'This is the clearest demonstration of the Big Society in action - and I'm proud it's a Conservative government that will deliver it.' But Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors (IoD), criticised the announcement, saying the policy did not appear to have been thought through. 'Many, many businesses are already highly engaged in their local community and with charitable causes, and the IoD thoroughly supports them. Passing a law to compel firms to pay their staff to volunteer for charity is hardly in keeping with the spirit of philanthropy. 'Businesses should support their staff if they want to volunteer, but the architects of this idea cannot pretend that forcing firms to give an additional three days of paid leave will do anything other than add costs. Time off for charity work and volunteering is a matter for managers and employees to discuss between themselves, not a target for heavy-handed government intervention. 'This announcement not only undermines the Tory record on reducing business regulation, it also puts additional pressure on public sector employers, and ultimately the taxpayer. Frankly, the essence of volunteering is that it is voluntary. The IoD would welcome proposals to incentivise and make it easier for companies to facilitate volunteering, but it has to be a choice.' Mr Cameron's plan will affect around 15 million workers across Great Britain in private and public sectors . Survival expert and Television star Bear Grylls said that he supports Mr Cameron's volunteering scheme . The plan was praised by the chairman of BT Mike Rake. He said: 'Corporate volunteering is a triple win - a win for the community, a win for individuals doing the volunteering, and a win for companies.' Survival expert and TV star Bear Grylls also lent Mr Cameron his support for the scheme. 'Any initiative that encourages people to volunteer is good news,' he said. 'All of us struggle to find extra time and that's why to have firm government support that enables millions to volunteer is a huge step forward towards building solid communities all around the UK.' However, just hours after Cameron's announcement, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said companies would not be forced to organise paid time-off for their employees, suggesting the policy would be unworkable. 'Nobody is forcing anybody to volunteer and no one is forcing companies to organise this volunteering if it causes problems to the company,' Mr Pickles told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added there would need to be 'a bit of give and take' with the Prime Minister's plan. The Communities Secretary insisted it would not add to costs in the NHS, with potential gaps having to be filled by extra agency workers. 'We're talking about three days and it would be worked out according to patterns of work and it will be worked out to ensure that it doesn't cause inconvenience to the health service,' he said. The former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said Mr Pickles had given a 'car crash' interview. He tweeted: 'If yesterday's Michael Fallon interview was a car crash, Eric Pickles just caused a motorway pile-up #r4today.' Mr Pickles suggested companies would not be forced to give staff days-off for volunteering under the plan . Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott offered his view on Pickles' interview on the Today programme . The Labour party raised concerns about the cost of the policy. Shadow minister Lisa Nandy said: 'This is a re-announcement from David Cameron that has unravelled before it's even been made. 'Giving every public servant three extra days off could cost millions of pounds but there's no sense of how it will be paid for. If just half of public sector workers took this up it would be the time equivalent of around 2,000 nurses, 800 police and almost 3,000 teachers.'","Prime Minister announced plan to amend Working Times regulations .

"A Boston father of two died 11 days after he was brutally beaten during an 'unprovoked attack' inside of a bar late last month. Keith Boudreau, 42, of Quincy was pronounced dead on Friday morning following the March 23 attack where he was knocked to the ground and had his head stomped on while at Home Ice Sports Bar. Officials said he died from his injuries. Paul Fahey, 43, allegedly beat Boudreau for just staring in his direction, according to court documents. He was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries following the attack and was removed from life support on Monday, according to My Fox Boston. Scroll down for video . A father of two sons died from injuries, official said, following a March 23 attack where he was brutally beaten (above, Keith Boudreau pictured) Boudreau, 42, was pronounced dead on Friday morning and a vigil was held from him in the evening at the location opposite of where he was attacked . Paul Fahey (above), 43, reportedly beat Boudreau for just staring in his direction during the 'unprovoked attack', according to court documents . 'Completely unprovoked, this defendant went over to the victim, punched him in the face, and then while the victim was lying on the ground, stomped on his head, he also then took the victim and dragged him on the hard floor of the bar, dragged him through the bar and out to a back alleyway where he left him,' said Assistant District Attorney Craig Kowalski reports NECN. On Wednesday, Fahey was arraigned on assault and battery charges, and pleaded not guilty. However, the Norfolk District Attorney's office said Friday following Boudreau's death that they are seeking to arraign Fahey again and charge him with murder on Monday morning, according to CBS. During the incident last month, Fahey was sitting at the bar when he was unprovoked and got up and hit Boudreau, who had just walked in and was knocked unconscious. Boudreau was punched and stomped on the head before being dragged out of Home Ice Sports Bar (above) in Quincy, witnesses told police . Police said surveillance footage showed Fahey, who according to court documents is a member of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club, dragging the unconscious body out of a back door before he met two men. Fahey was arrested last Thursday following the attack after a witness identified him, but was scared for his life due to Fahey's reputation as a 'dangerous person', according to the Patriot Ledger. When he was taken into custody, police found a five-inch sheath knife along with several other smaller knives in the door console of his car. He now also faces a charge of carrying a dangerous weapon. Boudreau was fighting for his life at Massachusetts General Hospital and was taken off life support on Monday . Boudreau's family released a statement earlier this week saying that he was not expected to live. 'First of all, we want to thank everyone who has reached out and shown their support and love,' the family said reports the Boston Globe. 'Keith is a loving, caring son, father, and brother. 'He has two wonderful boys, 15 and 8, whom he loves very much. And they think the world of him.' The family also said in the statement released on Wednesday: 'Keith is the kindest person. Even on his worst days, he is kinder than most. He would not hurt a person. He just didn't have it in him.' A vigil was held for Boudreau on Friday evening on the lawn of the Crane Library in Quincy Square, which is opposite of where he was attacked.

"Hillary Clinton shaped State Department policy to reward big money foreign donors to her family foundation, an explosive new book written by a political foe will claim. According to author Peter Schweizer there is a clear trend of money flowing into the controversial Clinton Foundation and rewards emerging for donors - in forms such as free trade agreements and development projects. The claims against Clinton, Secretary of State from 2009-13, are laid out in Clinton Cash, due to be published May 5th by HarperCollins. Bombshell: Clinton Cash, right, a new book by Peter Schweizer, is set to spell out a trend whereby big money donors to the Clinton Foundation found U.S. policies coming out of the State Department shift in their favor . Introducing the book, former George W Bush speechwriter said: 'We will see a pattern of financial transactions involving the Clintons that occurred contemporaneous with favorable U.S. policy decisions benefiting those providing the funds'. The passage, and examples of the donations and decisions Schweizer analyzes, were published Sunday by the New York Times, which was given an advance copy of the book. The Times reported that Clinton Cash lists examples of the pattern including a free trade agreement in Colombia that benefited a donor with industrial interests there. It also cites development projects in Haiti after their devastating 2010 earthquake, and a $1million payment to Bill Clinton made by a Canadian shareholder in the Keystone XL oil pipeline while it was being discussed by State Department officials. Author: Peter Schweizer, pictured, researched donations made to Clinton's foundation and was noted by the Times for 'meticulously' documenting his sources . As well as contending that the Clintons favored donors to swell the coffers of the foundation, Schweizer also writes that some of the big-money deals 'put millions in their own pockets'. Marketing information from HaperCollins includes more claims, citing 'the Clinton’s [sic] troubling dealings in Kazakhstan, Colombia, Haiti, and other places at the ""wild west"" fringe of the global economy.' It continued that the book will see Schweizer raise 'serious questions of judgment, of possible indebtedness to an array of foreign interests, and ultimately, of fitness for high public office.' The White House declined on Monday to categorically rule out the occurrence of any wrongdoing but said there's no 'tangible evidence to indicate that it did.' 'I'm not gonna be in a position here, where every time somebody raises a spurious claim...to sit down here and say that it's not true,' President Barack Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said. Earnest directed reporters who had further questions to Clinton's presidential campaign. Clinton allies have characterized the book as simply the latest in a series of 'absurd conspiracy theories' designed to derail Clinton's 2016 campaign. According to the Times, Republican senators - including presidential candidates Rand Paul and Marco Rubio - have been briefed on the book's findings, and are working them into their campaigns. Paul in particular has been unstinting in his criticism of Clinton, positioning himself as an anti-Hillary candidate before she even announced she was running. No more, please: In light of her presidential bid, the Clinton Foundation has stopped accepting donations from most governments - notably Saudi Arabia. Pictured above is Clinton while Secretary of State standing with her counterparts from Saudi Arabia (right) and Kuwait (left) The Kentucky senator's Twitter feed Sunday night included several references to foreign Clinton donations - and his official website includes a whistle-blowing form where members of the public can forward 'additional information' to Paul's campaign. In light of repeated attacks on the activities of the Clinton Foundation - which is named after Bill, Hillary and their daughter Chelsea - it recently stopped accepting money from all but six foreign governments. Clinton also resigned from the foundation's board when she announced her presidential bid. After the moves, a spokesman said: 'By implementing this new, even stronger and more transparent policy, the Clinton Foundation is reinforcing its commitment to accountability while protecting programs that are improving the lives of millions of people around the world'.","New book, Clinton Cash, points to 'pattern' of donations and rewards .

"Latika Bourke had a blissfully happy childhood  running around care-fee with her seven siblings in their backyard in regional Australia. Although she was adopted from India along with two of her siblings, it never occurred to her that she should explore her origins in India, where she was born before being adopted and starting a new life in the Lucky Country as an eight month old baby. But that all changed when she watched the movie Slumdog Millionaire and realised how profoundly different her life would have been if her new parents didn't take her in their arms and change her life forever. The film was nothing short of life-changing for Latika and led her to a fulfilling spiritual journey back to where it all began in an orphanage in the slums of India - the country she instantly fell in love with and has become her second home. Scroll down for video . Latika Bourke had no interest about looking into her origins until she watched the movie Slumdog Millionaire which she found life-changing . On her first visit to India she visited the orphanage before she was adopted and was shown the only record of her time there as a baby - Latika was very moved by the entry log with two photos of her as a baby . Latika - pictured with two nuns at the former orphanage - who kept the crib she was rocked in as a bundle of joy . 'I'm not exaggerating when I say it was one of the most profound moments of my life,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was the first time I really understood what could have happened if I hadn't been adopted. 'And the fact that the little girl in the movie had my name - I have never heard of anyone with my name before - it was really extraordinary.' It took Latika another three years to make it to India in 2012 and she has been every year since - admitting to being 'absolutely obsessed' with her mother country. 'I never had any sense of a part of me that was missing had been filled but I felt fuller as a person - I got that part of my story I had never known.' Latika's parents had two children then adopted her and Damian, from the same orphanage in Bihar, and their sister Rani from another part of India, and then had three another children of their own. She described her childhood in Bathurst, 200km west of Sydney, as 'noisy, busy and happy'. Her parents Penny (left) and John Bourke (centre) with Latika (right) at her school graduation . Damian (left) who was also adopted by Penny and John from the same orphanage as Latika (right) Latika with two of her sisters Gabriela (left) and her oldest sibling Melissa (right) Latika is grateful to have grown up in Australia . The most emotional part of her first visit to India was going back to the orphanage where she was greeted by the nuns  with the warmest possible words: 'welcome home - this is your home'. 'It was a spiritual homecoming - by the end of the last couple of days that I stayed there I definitely felt like it was my home,' she said. The orphanage is now run as a centre to help the disadvantaged and educates young girls, but the nuns have kept a book with a handwritten record of the day she arrived and then when she was handed over to her adoptive parents. Although the details were very brief, along with with two back and white head shots, and don't provide any clues to where Latika had come from, she was over the moon. 'It's incredible that a few sentences and some ruled lines can mean anything but it did, it was just wow - a ""this is me"" moment - I cried happy tears,' she said. 'It was the first time I felt that connection had been forged because suddenly I was in this different country and there's me - my name in this book written 30 years ago it was amazing.'

Despite looking distinctly different to five of her siblings, Latika has never been confronted with any adversity growing up in Bathurst in regional in NSW . Going to India was a spiritual homecoming for Latika . To add to the heartwarming experience the nuns had kept a crib from the orphanage that Latika was rocked in as a precious bundle of joy. She will feel eternally grateful to the nuns who cared for her as a defenceless tiny baby when nobody else could in the poverty-stricken state of Bihar. 'The nuns said they were sorry that they didn't have any more information but back then they were just so focused on trying to look after the babies and place them into loving homes - they just didn't think that these children would come back,' she said. 'It was a humbling experience to see that was my beginning and that I have so much to thank them for. 'It was really lovely to  just see the value and the loving start that I had been given which I had always appreciated but never fully comprehended until I was there.' She has felt so blessed by her journey that she decided to write a book about her experience. Despite looking distinctly different to five of her siblings, Latika has never been confronted with any adversity growing up in the country.

"The cyclone strength winds currently battering the NSW coast are being caused by an intense low-pressure system known as an East Coast Low. The stormy weather system,  formed in the Tasman Sea, hasn't hit NSW this strong since 2007 and is expected to be one of the longest lasting ever. East Coast Lows are particularly common in June and tend to be more frequent in autumn and winter. They are characterised by gales or storm force winds that can damage buildings, fell trees and powerlines, cause powerful surf that can damage the coast and, in some cases, run ships aground. They can also dump hundreds of millimetres of rain, causing flash flooding and riverine flooding. Climate specialist Don White from WeatherWatch told Daily Mail Australia: 'It forms occasionally, usually once a year. But this particular one is quite strong and close to the coast winds are up to 135kmh and rain up to 200mm.’ ‘This one is probably the strongest since 2007 and it is also going to be the longest lasting one,’ Mr White said. Scroll down for video .

On Monday night 24 Sydney suburbs incurred 100mm of rainfall, with Blacktown hit hardest, thanks to the latest East Coast Low. An estimated 100,000 homes are without power on Tuesday morning across Sydney, the Central Coast and Hunter region. And a floodwater rescue operation is underway in Hunter area where there have been wind gusts of up to 125km/h - levels recorded in category two cyclones.

State Emergency Services Deputy Commissioner Steve Pearce told the ABC on Tuesday the police and NSW Fire and Rescue had been called in to help the SES on the 2400 call-outs they've received so far, with many more expected in daylight when people can see the damage around their homes. 'We've had 24 hours of relentless gale-force winds. I haven't seen this wind damage for years,' Mr Pearce said. Some have speculated this week’s East Coast Low will be the worst in five years, while meteorologist with Weatherzone Rob Sharpe told the Sydney Morning Herald: ‘This is going to be our most significant east coast low since spring.’ ‘The last major one that has affected Newcastle was in 2007. East Coast Lows were common in the 1970s but became less common in the 90s,’ Mr White said. Winds of at least 100km/h lashed parts of the east coast, causing this tree to fall on a car in East Gosford, on the NSW Central Coast, on Monday with a driver and passenger inside.

Other notable east coast lows occurred in October 2004, when there were mean wave heights off Sydney of 5m with a maximum height of about 10m. In August 1998, more than 300mm of rain fell over four days in Sydney and Illawarra, 420mm at Beaumont and 401mm at Kangaroo Valley.

"A teenage factory girl in China dumped her newborn child in a toilet after giving birth – before going back to work on a shoe production line. The baby boy was found in the female toilets of a shoe factory in Wenzhou City by a cleaner, prompting its managers to start searching for the mother. They found Xiao Ying, 17, working on the production line – but she completely denied giving birth to the child, The People’s Daily Online reported. The baby boy was dumped by his teenager mother in a factory toilets, before she went back to work. Xiao Ying, 17, said she was afraid to tell her parents she was pregnant and wanted to 'forget the entire incident' When a cleaner found the child in the femaie toilets he was 'icy cold'. The baby's condition is now improving but his traumatic birth could lead to problem later in life. The father of the girl said they could not keep the baby . It was only when the managers spotted blood on the girl’s shoe that she admitted she was the mother. CCTV filmed Ying going into the toilets at 8.11am clutching her tummy – and walking slowly back out at 8.13am, only one minute and 49 seconds later. The teenager said she managed to hid the pregnancy for months because 'no-one cared, and no-one asked.' She said: ‘I found out I was pregnant four to five months ago. I was experiencing a lot of morning sickness and felt movement in my stomach. ‘I didn’t tell my parents because I was afraid of being beaten.’ The father of the baby is 18 years old. The couple had planned to get married but didn’t go through with it. When they broke up Ying – whose surname is Ding – said she didn’t know she was pregnant and she had not been in contact with him, adding she could hardly remember what he looked like. When asked why she abandoned her baby she said: ‘At the time I had lots of abdominal pain so I went to the toilet. ‘When the baby came out I was terrified so I quickly ran to the dormitory, changed my clothes and just wanted to forget the entire incident.’ Authorities at the shoe factory, like the one pictured here, found the mother back working on the production line. She denied giving birth, but came clean when managers saw that she had blood on her shoes . Ying said she was afraid to tell her parents she was pregnant in case they beat her. Her father has now said they will not raise her child, saying: ' My daughter isn't married. We cannot keep this baby.' Ying’s father arrived to arrange her medical treatment, but said the family had no intention of keeping the baby and would ask the father’s family to step in. ‘My daughter isn’t married. We cannot keep this baby’, he said. A member of the HR department at the factory said they found the mother back on the production line. He said: ‘At the time she was very calm and this puzzled me. ‘As there was a lot of people nearby I asked her to come to the office where she was adamant that she was not the mother of the child but when we discovered blood on her shoes she admitted she was the mother.’ Mr Shao, the cleaner who found the child, said when he held the baby he was ‘icy cold’. He said: ‘The young girl was too cruel. At 8am there’s usually no one in the dormitories. 'Luckily the baby boy was strong enough to cry out. ‘I used my coat and some sheets to wrap him up and turned on the heater for him before he began to warm up again.’ Dr Xiao said when the baby arrived at hospital at 10.20am his body temperature was just 30.5 degrees. By 4pm treatment had helped it rise to 35.8 degrees, but Dr Xiao said while the baby was generally well, his initial low body temperature could affect his development in the future. Sex education in China is notoriously poor, with people increasing calling for schools and parents to do more as a way of stopping unwanted pregnancies, rising rates of sexually transmitted diseases and acts of sexual violence.","17-year-old gave birth in shoe factory in China - then went back to work .

"Virtual reality headsets could help to tackle air sickness and jet lag during flights, according to a team of British engineers. A new device, called the Flow VR, provides passengers with a virtual image of the horizon that mimics the movements of the aircraft. This can help to combat the conflict between the information coming from a person's eyes and their sense of balance in the inner ear, which can lead to travel sickness. The system, designed by In-flight entertainment company Flow IFE, can also present travellers with high quality images of their destination that replicate the time of day to help them acclimatise to their new time zone. Airline Qantas is the first to introduce virtual reality headsets to its passengers (above) to keep them entertained during long flights but the devices could also help combat problems like air sickness and jet lag . Leon Codrington, general manager for product development at in-flight entertainment company Flow IFE, which has created the device, told The Times: 'The worst thing for bringing on motion sickness is a disconnect between what the eyes are seeing and what the body is feeling. Self-driving cars may be a way to take your eyes off the road and relax a little, but they can also increase travel sickness, research has found. The research was carried out by Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. They asked more than 3,200 adults across the US, India, China, Japan, Great Britain and Australia what kinds of activities  they would do instead of driving in a fully self-driving vehicle. More than a third of Americans said they would do things that increase the likelihood and severity of motion sickness, including reading, texting, watching movies or television, playing games or working. More than half of Indians, 40 per cent of Chinese and up to 30 per cent of adults in Japan, Great Britain and Australia said they would also engage in these kinds of activities. The figures suggest that once autonomous vehicles become more mainstream as many as 12 per cent of people will feel ill in the vehicles at some point during a journey. 'If you're sat still, looking at a seat in front that isn't moving, yet you can feel the aircraft weaving all over the skies, that can make you feel ill very quickly. 'What our system does is eliminate that disconnect by showing you a horizon that moves up and down as the aircraft does.' The company showcased a prototype of its device at the Aircraft International Expo in Hamburg last week. The device uses accelerometers to detect the movement of the aircraft and displays a horizon that moves with it inside. The display can also provide passengers with a way of exploring their destination with three dimensional content. Notifications from the crew can also be displayed on the screen to help keep passengers informed while they can also be used to watch movies or play games. The headsets are expected to cost between £300 and £500 each. Virtual reality headsets, however, are already starting to be introduced as part of in-flight entertainment systems on aircraft. Qantas became the first airline to offer viritual realilty headsets to first class passengers earlier this year. For years virtual reality headsets have had their own motion sickness problem as the graphics often failed to keep pace with the users movements. The graphic above shows how the virtual reality goggles would help to relieve the symptoms of travel sickness . The VR headsets would use accelerometres to detect the movement of the aircraft so it can be displayed on the screen, helping to reduce the mismatch between the eyes and inner ear that can lead to travel sickness . However, new devices have started to overcome this by using faster graphics and screen refresh rates. Recent research by Purdue university also found that inserting an image of a virtual human nose into an virtual reality image could also help reduce nauseousness. Mr Codrington told Mail Online that their device could distinguish from movements of the wearers head and the aircraft by using motion sensors that are connected to the seat or from a wireless signal from the aircraft. He said they also hoped to begin talks with a company that makes external cameras to produce a 360 degree live view outside of the aircraft for passengers.","British technology company Flow IFE has built a prototype device that shows passengers virtual horizon that mimics the movement of the aircraft .

"An accomplice who was aged 16 when he held a knife to Pamela Smart's husband's throat before a friend shot him dead has been granted parole after 25 years. Patrick Randall was 16 in May 1990 when he held a knife to Gregory Smart's throat as his friend Billy Flynn, shot him in the head. Flynn was Pamela Smart's then-16-year-old lover and shot her husband dead at her request. Patrick Randall (pictured) was 16 in May 1990 when he held a knife to Gregory Smart's throat as Billy Flynn, who was Pamela Smart's then-16-year-old lover, shot him in the head . Dean Smart, brother of Gregory Smart, speaks to Patrick Randall, left, with his attorney Mark Stevens during Randall's parole hearing on Thursday . Randall, 17, testifies in Rockingham County Superior Court in Exeter, N.H in 1991 . Flynn was paroled last month; Smart is serving life without parole after being convicted of plotting the murder. Now 41, Randall won parole Thursday at his first hearing  - he won't be released until after June 4. Smart was media coordinator at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton, where both boys were students, when she first seduced Flynn in the months before her husband was killed. Flynn testified that she told him she needed her husband killed because she feared she would lose everything if they divorced. Pamela Smart (seen in 1991) was convicted of conspiring with her teen lover, William 'Billy' Flynn, to kill her 24-year-old husband, Gregory Smart. Smart is serving a life without parole sentence . In this 1991 file photo, Flynn testifies on his 17th birthday how he shot Gregory Smart in the head . He said she threatened to break up with him if he did not kill Gregg Smart. On May 1, 1990, Randall and Flynn entered the Smarts' Derry condominium and forced Gregg Smart to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man's throat, Flynn fired a hollow-point bullet into his head. The trial was a media circus and one of the first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between a school staff member and student. It inspired the Joyce Maynard novel 'To Die For,' which in turn was made into a movie starring Nicole Kidman. Murdered: Smart's husband, Gregory Smart (seen on their wedding day), was shot in the head in May 1990 . Randall and Flynn pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and after plea bargains eventually got sentences of 28 years to life. In March 2009, a judge knocked three years off Randall's sentence over the objection of prosecutors who noted that he was involved in a jailhouse assault 15 years before. The judge said Randall's record otherwise had been spotless and that he had shown extreme remorse. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released. Pamela Smart, who was 22 when her husband was killed, was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole. She has admitted seducing the boy but said she didn't plan her husband's murder. She was moved to a women's prison in New York state for unspecified security reasons. Smart has consistently lobbied for her release, maintaining after Flynn was granted parole that if the person who pulled the trigger could be freed, she deserves the same chance. The case inspired the 1995 movie 'To Die For.' In the film, Nicole Kidman plays a woman named Suzanne Stone, who becomes involved in a relationship with a teen, played by Joaquin Phoenix .","Patrick Randall was 16 in May 1990 when he held a knife to Gregory Smart's throat as Billy Flynn shot him in the head .

"Residents living yards from the scene of the £60million Hatton Garden heist have revealed how they were hit by 'peculiar' power cuts on the weekend before the daring crime. They also claim to have heard ‘drilling’ noises on the evening of Good Friday, but thought at the time that this was simply a continuation of road works that had been taking place in recent weeks. Meanwhile it has also been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the initial robbery  in central London to steal more loot after becoming 'greedy'. Scroll down for video . Arrival: Two members of the criminal gang, with their faces obscured, can be seen entering the building . Leaving the area: Later on, they exit the building with wheelies bins thought to be carrying the stolen loot . Scotland Yard admitted last week that an alarm first went off at the scene after midnight on Good Friday, but it was graded as 'no police response was deemed to be required'. Residents on Greville Street - near the scene close to Farringdon station - say they had suspicious power outages a full week before the heist, which they now think could be linked. Farhana Begum, 19, who lives in a flat just a ten-second walk from the raided premises, added: ‘My mum actually heard drilling on the [Good] Friday night, it was probably about 9pm or 9.30pm. ‘But there had been road works, or construction work, going on in the street for the last couple of weeks, so she thought that they may have been working late. Protection: One of the gang members carries a large plastic bag past the camera to help obscure his face . Vehicle: A white transit van used to transport the gang and their loot pulls away from outside the building . ‘But she did think it was quite weird that they would be drilling at that time. Also, about two weeks ago, so the weekend before it happened, there was an electrical cut.' Miss Begum added: ‘It was over that weekend, so before the Holborn fire [under Kingsway on April 1] as well. It happened on either the Friday or the Saturday, it was just a bit peculiar.’ Career criminal: Noel 'Razor' Smith, who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison, said the group was likely brought together by a 'Mr Big' Another local resident, data scientist John Han, 26, said: ‘We heard some type of loud noise which woke us up. It was late at night on the Friday or Saturday. I can't remember which. ‘I heard some type of noise. I'm not sure what it was, but I thought they were just doing road works in the street again. But I did think to myself why would somebody be doing road works at that time?’ Former bank robber Noel 'Razor' Smith - who was responsible for more than 200 bank robberies during his criminal career - believes the group made an unplanned return to the scene after their initial break-in when they realised their robbery had not been discovered. Mr Smith, speaking after having analysed video footage of the raid, told The Daily Mirror the organised criminals would be aware of the huge risk involved in returning for more spoils, but the rewards outweighed the danger. On Saturday night, police released dramatic CCTV images of the raid in the hope of a breakthrough in the investigation. The pictures show the robbers at work over several days as they take part in the raid on the basement packed with security boxes in London's diamond district. Described as 'highly audacious' by Metropolitan Police detectives, the men - wearing Adidas tracksuits, builders' hats and high-visibility jackets - were captured entering the building through a side exit, before leaving hours later with a wheelie bin full of jewels. The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . The group left the jewellers on Good Friday after having first appeared on camera the day before. But one of the thieves then reappeared on camera late Saturday night - a move Mr Smith described as a 'huge risk'. Saturday, March 28 . Thursday, April 2 . Friday, April 3 . Saturday, April 4 . Sunday, April 5 . Tuesday, April 7 . Mr Smith told reporter David Collins, writing for the Daily Mirror: 'He could be out the country by now spending the rest of his life a very rich man. Instead he's come back for more. 'I don't think this was part of the plan. But criminals are greedy.' Mr Smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a 'Mr Big' who organised an elite crew made up of Europeans and Israelis, unknown to each other, acting on his inside information. CCTV shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd building. It is now known they then took stairs to the second floor, disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault, avoiding security doors. The footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door. At 9.23pm on the Thursday, just minutes after employees left for the Easter bank holiday weekend, a red-haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault. A street camera then picked up a white Ford Transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left. The men, wearing high-visibility jackets and hard hats, carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault. It is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ft-thick vault wall. On Good Friday, at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls, tools and the bins, now believed to be filled with diamonds, cash and jewellery. The van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off. At 10.17pm on Saturday, the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes. From 5.46am on Sunday, the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van. They then loaded up the van and drove off at 6.44am. In total, 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault. Possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from Russian gangsters to former Serbian military personnel, or that they are part of the 'Pink Panther Gang' from the Balkans. Scotland Yard was branded as 'incompetent' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the Friday from a company who monitors alarms across the South East, but instead of acting on it, deemed it 'no police response required'. A police spokesman said: 'The call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. 'The call was recorded and transferred to the police's (computer) system. A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required.' He added: 'We are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call. This investigation is being carried out locally. It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident.' In response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and 'drilling' noises, a police spokesman declined to comment. Meanwhile, a Ukip candidate who is under investigation for handing out sausage rolls to voters has revealed that he may have lost valuables in the Hatton Garden burglary. Kim Rose, a jeweller who is standing in the Southampton Itchen constituency in Hampshire, had a box at the safe deposit hit in the raid. The 58-year-old made headlines last week when it emerged that police want to question him after a report that he tried to woo potential voters with refreshments at a party event. Mr Rose is still waiting to hear whether his was among 72 boxes which were taken in the burglary and will be interviewed by police tomorrow morning over the sausage roll claims. WHERE WERE THE GANG FROM? Speculation over the gang’s origin has been feverish. Possible identities put forward have ranged from former Serbian military personnel to Russian gangsters, or that they are members of the so-called Pink Panther Gang from the Balkans, who have carried out robberies across Europe. However, the Pink Panthers have been violent and aggressive in the past, which was not the case here. AN ACCOMPLICE ON THE INSIDE? The men reached the fire exit through an alley leading from a side street in Hatton Garden, but this alley is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key. Furthermore, there was no sign of a forced entry through the fire exit door into the company’s premises, indicating they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside. Another theory is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises. LOOT SMUGGLED OUT OF THE COUNTRY? Some believe the haul was stolen to order for the Middle Eastern market. Whoever their buyer, it is agreed by police, former robbers and crime experts that the gems are likely to have already left the country - and probably very soon after the raid. According to one former robber quoted in a newspaper at the weekend, getting the goods out of the country would be ‘a doddle’. WHAT ABOUT THE ‘KING OF DIAMONDS’? A criminal mastermind known as the 'King of Diamonds' was named last week among the prime suspects. The only known picture of the mysterious robber comes from an unsolved raid on a Knightsbridge's Graff diamond store in 2007. The Panama hat-wearing raider entered the exclusive shop after jumping out of a chauffeur-driven Bentley. He and an accomplice then pulled out guns and made off with £13million worth of jewellery.","Locals say power cuts the weekend before raid could be linked to heist .

"A newly released video shows the shocking moment a Boston police officer was shot in the face just seconds after approaching a driver who was stopped during a gunfire investigation. The video shows how Angelo West, 41, immediately jumps out of the car and shoots Officer John Moynihan, 34, under the eye at close range after the policeman opens the driver-side door. West then fires at the other officers as he runs across the busy street. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans pointed out that he was firing 'under his arm' at the other cops. The video shows Boston police officer John Moynihan, circled in white, opening the driver-side door to talk to Angelo West after the car was pulled over during a gunfire investigation . West then immediately jumps out of the car and shoots Moynihan in the face at close range . Officer Moynihan , 34, was released from the hospital Friday after weeks of recovery. The Boston Police Department described his current condition as 'serious but improving' The video, captured from the surveillance camera of a nearby store, shows the beginning of the shootout that led to officers firing the fatal shots that killed West. 'This particular incident we had no other choice,' Evans said about the fatal shooting. 'He had already used deadly force, trying to kill one of my officers, and the officers did what they were trained to do.' During a press conference, Evans said the video shows that the officers did not have their weapons drawn or have their hands their hands on their weapons when they approached West's car. Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said it was important to release the video to show the community exactly what happened - and why. 'In those instances in which video evidence can inform the public... it is in everyone's best interest to share that information as soon as possible,' Conley said during the press conference. The district attorney said such transparency was necessary to 'tamp down speculation and rumors meant to inflame and not to inform'. 'Our goal going forward is to ensure that we are one people and one city,' he said. Evans said Moynihan had seen the video. Angelo West was fatally shot by Moynihan's colleagues during the shoot-out. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said that 'during this particular incident' the officers had no other choice . The video shows how West fired at the other officers after shooting Moynihan while he ran across the street . 'He probably realizes he's really lucky to be talking at this point, to be shot so suddenly with a .357 Magnum in the face and to be around talking about it, and hopefully to make as much of a full recovery as we think he's going to,' he said during the conference, captured by WCVB. But Evans said 'there are no winners here'. 'We have an officer who was seriously injured, and we have a family who is grieving the loss of a loved one,' he said. Moynihan was released from the hospital yesterday after weeks of recovering from the gunshot wound. His condition was described as 'serious but improving' in a statement released by the Boston Police Department. The statement said Moynihan wanted to 'thank and acknowledge the officers on scene for their lightening quick reaction and response that he credits for saving his life'. Moynihan is a highly decorated military veteran awarded a medal for bravery by President Obama for his involvement in a shoot-out with the Boston Bombing suspects. After the March 28 shooting, Moynihan was placed in an induced coma as he fought for his life. He also had to undergo surgery for the removal of the bullet lodged under his right eye. Moynihan and five other officers approached West's car to speak to one of his two passengers, alleged gang member Dennis Wilson Jr. There were reports of gunfire near where Wilson lived and he was tracked down using the GPS coordinates of a bracelet he had to wear while on bail for unrelated charges, according to the Boston Globe. The officers stopped the SUV in two unmarked police vehicles and headed to the car so they could remove Wilson and West's second passenger Jonathan Aguasvivas, who was wanted on unrelated domestic violence charges. According to the Boston Globe, West has a criminal record including multiple gun, drug and assault charges that go back 24 years. Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said it was important to release the video to show the community exactly what happened - and why .","Video shows how John Moynihan, 34, was shot within seconds of opening Angelo West's car door .

"Robin, now 73, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by chance in 1999, aged 58 . Robin Ellis shot to fame in the Seventies as the original dashing hero Ross Poldark. At the time, he was as much a heart throb as Aidan Turner, star of the hugely successful BBC remake of the Cornish epic that concludes on Sunday. In fact, even now at the age of 73 Robin has retained the physique that helped make him famous - as he showed in a cameo in the BBC remake. Yet even though he has been slim all his life - 12st, which is perfect for his 6ft 1½in frame - Robin has type 2 diabetes, a condition that many of us associate with being overweight. In type 2 diabetes, the body's cells fail to react to insulin, causing blood sugar levels to soar which, if uncontrolled, can lead to blindness, kidney damage, heart disease and circulation problems, especially in the feet and legs. Robin was diagnosed by chance in 1999 aged 58 after a friend was diagnosed with prostate cancer and he decided to get himself checked. 'It was clear, but blood tests showed my blood glucose levels were high,' he says. 'Six months later, I was tested again and told I had type 2 diabetes.' He had none of the tell-tale symptoms such as increased thirst or urination. Although he had smoked 20 roll-ups a day for 20 years, he gave up when he was 40. He was running five or six miles a day, and didn't have a sweet tooth. So how did he end up with type 2 diabetes? Normally, it occurs in those who are overweight or who have an inactive lifestyle. This is thought to be linked to excess fat cells releasing chemicals that disrupt the way the body responds to insulin. However, the problem can also develop in apparently slim people with a normal Body Mass Index (BMI). That's because diabetes is strongly linked to visceral fat - which is hidden in the abdomen, around the organs. 'BMI doesn't tell the whole story and it's just as important where the fat is on your body,' says Julian Halcox, professor of cardiology at the University of Cardiff. 'Studies show some people can have a normal BMI, but a higher proportion of fat than you might expect from looking at them.' This does not appear to have been the problem for Robin. He'd been only too aware of the risks of diabetes - his mother died aged 67 of a heart attack brought on by 30 years of type 1 diabetes. Pictured here in Poldark, he was struck by Michel Montignac's book, Dine Out And Lose Weight, which advocates giving up white (refined) carbohydrates rather than counting calories . 'Because of my poor mum's history, I was fully aware of what my diagnosis meant,' he says. Type 2 diabetes has a strong genetic element - if a parent has it, there's a 50 per cent chance their child will, too. However, Robin's mother had type 1 diabetes, which is an entirely different type and so it's likely to be just a coincidence. In type 1 diabetes, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed, meaning none is released, whereas in type 2 the pancreas may produce decent levels of insulin but the body is resistant to it. The diabetes picture has changed dramatically since Robin's mother's days. Rates of type 2 diabetes have soared, due to rising obesity levels, and it is being diagnosed at a much younger age. In the UK in 2010 there were 3.1 m over-16s with diabetes, 90 per cent with type 2. By 2030, there are expected to be 4.6 m people with the condition, equivalent to one in ten of the adult population. 'There is an epidemic of type 2 and the myth that this is a milder form of diabetes has been totally busted,' says Dr Graham Toms, consultant diabetes specialist at Newham University Hospital, East London. Indeed while complications such as nerve damage to the eyes and feet equally affect both types of diabetes, damage to the large blood vessels in the heart, brain and legs are far more common with type 2. Heart disease is a common complication of type 2 diabetes, because high blood sugar can damage the blood vessels and raise the risk of arteries becoming blocked. Once he was diagnosed, Robin was determined to do everything he could to limit the damage through lifestyle changes. Previously his diet included meals grabbed from the catering truck while filming on location as well as late-night meals with friends while sharing several bottles of wine after coming off stage. Now, he has eliminated sugar and refined carbohydrates such as white bread from his diet, and developed a passion for cooking from scratch. 'After being told about diabetes, I read up on it and was struck by Michel Montignac's book, Dine Out And Lose Weight, which advocates giving up white (refined) carbohydrates (that release sugar quickly into the bloodstream) rather than counting calories. I made the changes immediately.' Robin has since written a number of cookbooks for people with diabetes, as he found there was a lack of recipes available. The proportion of hospital beds occupied by patients with diabetes . When filming for the current series of Poldark, he took his own healthy breakfast. 'I travel with oats, walnuts, dried apricots and prunes to which I add almond milk, which is virtually sugar-free, and then I'll have rye bread.' Robin's other lifestyle change was to walk the recommended 150 minutes a week, little but often (he'd given up running by then). The result was extraordinary. For ten years he was able to control his blood sugar through these methods alone. Only recently has he been put on medication, as diabetes is a progressive disease which worsens with age. Only a minority of patients can combat the disease without drugs for so long. 'It is achievable, but only in patients who have the knowledge and motivation to do it,' says Dr Toms. Six years ago, Robin was put on diamicron, a form of sulphonylurea drug, which stimulates the pancreas to produce more insulin. Three months ago, he was also given januvia, which prevents the breakdown of the gut hormone GLP-1, whose role is to prompt insulin release after a meal. Two years ago, routine tests indicated that Robin had possible artery problems and he was sent to a clinic. 'I arrived light-hearted as I wasn't short of breath or suffering chest pains - and found myself having an angioplasty (a procedure to widen a blocked artery) feeling like a chicken on a slab.' Under local anaesthetic, a catheter was threaded down his arm and a wire then delivered three stents - tiny mesh tubes - to widen the blocked artery. 'It took no time and I left feeling light-hearted again as it had been fixed. But it was further proof that you must take diabetes seriously.' Since then, all has been well. Robin - who lives with his American wife, Meredith, in Lautrec in south-west France, does have some numbness in his feet, another common complication of diabetes, and sees a chiropodist every three months. 'My blood glucose levels are checked every three months,' he says. 'There has been a small, steady rise over the years, consistent with my age but still very good. 'People get depressed and think their diagnosis is the end of the world. Well, it isn't. I'm still here and I'm aiming to die of old age, not diabetes.'

"Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding is arguably the most famous marital ceremony of the the 21st Century so far. So it is should be of little surprise that their choice of wedding decor has started to influence some of Britain's celebrities. As the preparations for Andy Murray and Kim Sears's nuptials reach the final few days, wedding planners for the couple have been seen carrying trees into Dunblane Cathedral ahead of Saturday's ceremony. Scroll down for video . Andy Murray and Kim Sears,pictured at the Wimbledon Champions Dinner 2013, are preparing to marry in his home town of Dunblane this weekend . The decoration was first seen at the royal wedding in 2011, when trees lined the aisle at the end of each pew in Westminster Abbey. There is less than 48 hours now until the Scottish tennis champion and his girlfriend exchange vows in his hometown. For the last week, the whole town have been getting involved in the celebrations. The inhabitants of the Dunblane have gone into overdrive for wedding of their most famous resident, lining the streets with bunting and creating special-themed produce in many of the stories. Trees were wheeled into Dunblane cathedral earlier today ahead of the nuptials . Trees lined the aisle at Prince Williams wedding to Kate Middleton . Am official portrait from the royal wedding in 2011 . Since the Wimbledon champion announced his plans to say 'I do' at the cathedral, there have also been plans to line the streets with well-wishers as the couple make their way to the venue. Messages to the happy couple are in many of the shop windows and several business owners have already sent gifts to either Andy, 27, or his bride-to-be ahead of the big day. Lesley Anderson, 52, who owns Point Nouveau Bridal shop in Dunblane, sent a crystal-covered garter to Kim Sears six weeks ago and received kind a thank you note which said it was 'gorgeous'. The ivory-coloured piece is hand-embroidered on the inside with the couple's initials and wedding date and was designed by Nicola Ure from K C Bridal specialists in Falkirk. A handmade card featuring Andy and Kim, 27, on the front drawn by local artist Lorna Brown accompanied the garter. Decorations feature in many of the shop windows in Dunblane . Messages and mascots also feature in the town's stores . The card shows Andy in his kilt holding a tennis racket and Kim in her dress along with their Border Terriers. Kim's reply to the gifts read: 'Dear Lesley and all at Point Nouveau Bridal. 'Just a little note to say a huge thank you for the gorgeous gift Nicola made for me. 'It was very kind of you and I hadn't found a garter yet so thanks ever so much. 'Also, that card of Lorna Brown's is absolutely fabulous! It really made us giggle, especially our two little dogs in the background! 'We are really excited for our big day in a month's time and are happy to be celebrating our wedding in Dunblane. 'Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and generosity. Best wishes, Kim Sears X.' Local shops and shop owners are preparing their shop fronts to reflect the great day . Many of the local businesses have decorated their shop fronts with colourful bunting . Lesley Anderson, 52, (left) who owns Point Nouveau Bridal shop in Dunblane, sent a crystal-covered garter to Kim Sears with a hand-drawn picture of the couple (left). Kim replied with a handwritten note (right . Lesley is close friends with Andy's grandmother, Shirley Erskine, 83 and gave the garter and card to her to take to Kim. She said: 'Out of the blue we got this beautiful card. To be honest we never ever thought we would hear very much at all so when we got this beautiful card we were chuffed to bits. 'I was absolutely delighted. This was such a personal thing. We were really, really chuffed. Andy continues to maintain a close bond with the town - after winning Wimbledon,  he shook hands with all the shop owners on the Dunblane High street. When Murray, 27, says 'I do' on April 11, the guests wishing them well will be largely a gathering of close family and friends. A local butcher has poems about the happy couple in the shop window . Murray's status as one of the world's best tennis players means he has mixed with everyone from A-list celebrities such as James Corden to the Prime Minister and even the Queen. But the biggest name likely to be in attendance at Dunblane Cathedral, where the couple are tying the knot, is one-time British tennis star Tim Henman. Indeed, when the sport's world number one, Novak Djokovic, was asked by a journalist recently if he would be attending the celebration, he replied with a curt: 'Not invited', before following up with a more charitable: 'But I wish him all the best.' A sign telling people about parking restrictions around Dunblane Cathedral ahead of Andy's wedding to Kim . Murray has said: 'There won't be any celebrities as such. 'I don't have any celebrity friends so it wasn't something that was planned. '[It'll be] Everyone who we're close to, people we've spent a lot of time with in the past but also people we see ourselves spending time with in the future. 'That's how we came up with the names. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I'm sure a few things will come up next week but it's pretty much sorted.' There will be names from the tennis world in attendance but certainly not players who are as well known as the likes of Nadal or Federer. Dunblane Cathedral, where the couple will hold their nuptials . Murray has invited Dutch doubles player Jules Rojer, who he spends time with while training in Miami and Davis Cup team mate James Ward. Another British pro Jamie Delgado will also attend. For the 27-year-old's many fans and friends in the town,  at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport, played out on the streets of the community. It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at luxury hotel Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck – so they too could toast his big day. The reception will be held at Cromlix, which Murray owns. Kim shows off her engagement ring at the Australian Open in Melbourne, Australia, last January . The 300-seat, 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix, which seats only 28. Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day. Murray's uncle Niall Erskine said: 'I'm sure it will be a popular decision, as he's had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. Andy has admitted that, food aside, he's left much of the preparation for the big day to his betrothed: 'Kim's been pretty much doing it' 'I've tried to help out when she has asked, but I haven't been over-involved. I did all the food and cake tasting which I really enjoyed, although I didn't think I was going to. He added: 'It's a big day for Kim. Pretty much everything is taken care of now. She seems fairly relaxed but as we get closer that might change.'","Andy Murray and Kim Sears are getting married in Dunblane this weekend .

"A thug who shook a baby girl so violently she was left permanently disabled and died more than a decade later was today jailed for three years for manslaughter. Kealeigh-Anne Woolley was just seven months old when she was left blind, unable to talk and severely brain damaged after being shaken by Colin Heath in January 2000. She spent most of her life in a wheelchair and could only eat through a tube until her death in 2011. Violently shaken: Kealeigh-Anne Woolley, pictured above before the incident, was just seven months old when she was left blind, unable to talk and severely brain damaged after being shaken by Colin Heath . Tragic: The child, pictured with her mother Amanda Woolley in 2001, spent most of her life in a wheelchair . Police arrested Heath, now 43, last September and yesterday he was jailed for three years and two months at Birmingham Crown Court after he admitted manslaughter. The judge, Mr Justice Sir Charles Haddon-Cave, said: 'It is clear that caring for Kealeigh had a profound effect for those who loved and cared for her, particularly her mother who also suffered. 'Kealeigh's mother describes movingly a lifetime of pain and anguish Kealeigh suffered in her [victim impact] statement. 'Her life was turned upside-down in January 2000. Her happy and healthy baby was suddenly disabled. 'The fact that Kealeigh lived as long as she did is a testament to the care and love by those around her. 'Her cause of death is directly attributable to the injury suffered in the care of Mr Heath in January 2000.' Her whole life ahead of her: Kealeigh-Anne, pictured looking healthy before the incident,  was subjected to the violent treatment by her mother's 28-year-old boyfriend at the time, Colin Heath . Worst nightmare: Kealeigh-Anne's mother had been out with her sister when the devastating incident took place. When she returned home later that night she found her daughter unresponsive and floppy . In her victim impact statement, Miss Woolley said: 'Keels would have been 16-years old this year. She should be getting excited for her school prom. She should be here for here for her family. 'You [Heath] took it all away from her. I thank Keels for giving me 11 years, 11 amazing years. I would do anything to have her back here. 'I cannot have her back though as she is gone forever.' Miss Woolley was 20 when she left her daughter with Heath, who she had been in a relationship with for two months, while she went out with her sister Angela on January 16, 2000. When she returned home later that night she found Kealeigh-Anne unresponsive and floppy on the floor of her home in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffs. Prosecutor Rachel Brand QC said: 'In January 2000, he [Heath] caused severe brain injuries to Kealeigh-Anne, who had been born on June 22, 1999, and therefore was aged seven months at the time. 'Her death on February 6, 2011, was a direct but delayed consequence of the injuries she suffered in January 2000. There is no dispute about any medical evidence. 'When Amanda Woolley came home late that evening, it was obvious to her that the baby was not well. 'She seemed to have one eye closed and had red marks on her forehead. 'Her neighbour, a mother herself, suggested she did not need to go to hospital.' When Kealeigh-Anne was still pale and floppy the next morning Miss Woolley rushed her to North Staffordshire Hospital where it was discovered that the child had fallen into a coma. Following the incident, she spent months in hospital but was left in a wheelchair, developed epilepsy, cerebral palsy and needed to wear a body cast because her limbs were completely rigid . Damning evidence: Experts compared pictures of Kealeigh-Anne taken on the night Miss Woolley went out and concluded she suffered the injuries while in the care of Heath . Miss Brand added: 'It was clear to the doctors she was in a bad state. She had very severe brain injuries. 'We heard the brain injuries were indicative of non-accidental shaking to which excessive force was used. 'There were excessive bruises on her arms, abdomen and back. 'Doctors were clear that Kealeigh-Anne could not have appeared normal after that severe brain injury was sustained. 'These injuries were life-threatening.' Experts compared pictures of Kealeigh-Anne taken on the night Miss Woolley went out and concluded she suffered the injuries while in the care of Heath. She spent months in hospital but she was left in a wheelchair, developed epilepsy, cerebral palsy and needed to wear a body cast because her limbs were completely rigid. Heath, then aged 28, was jailed for 18 months on December 4, 2000 after admitting child cruelty and causing grievous bodily harm at Stafford Crown Court. But he was re-arrested and charged with manslaughter after Kealeigh-Anne died on February 6, 2011 - almost exactly 11 years after the brutal shaking. Nursing assistant Miss Woolley, now 35, also mother to six-year-old daughter Ellie-Rose, found Kealeigh-Anne lying dead in bed at 9.40pm. Medical experts ruled her death was a direct result of her serious brain injuries sustained in the 2000 attack. Waste of a life: Kealeigh-Anne died in her sleep on Sunday February 6 2011 at the age of 11 . Stuart Muldoon, defending, said: 'This is a tragic case with tragic consequences. 'It was a short-lived shake of the child causing catastrophic injuries and ultimately death. 'Mr Heath had been living quite an active social life. He was a young man. He was 28 years of age at the time of the offence. 'He spent time, as most young men do, going out, frequenting nightclubs and bars. He has isolated himself since. He has been wracked with guilt. 'Nothing that he says and nothing that he does can take us back to that day in January 2000. 'It was an isolated incident and was not to cause violence or to cause cruelty against a small child. There was no intention to kill or cause serious injury. 'He has placed himself in almost complete isolation. His last relationship of any intimacy was back in 2003. He struggles to deal with the enormity of his actions. 'He is remorseful and he is sorry. He will still feel disgust and guilt and shame of what he did to Kealeigh and what impact that it had on her mother and the rest of her family.' Miss Woolley, who attended court yesterday and burst into tears when the sentence was handed down, refused to comment afterwards.","Kealeigh-Anne Woolley was 7 months old when Colin Heath shook her .

"An unidentified male concert-goer has come under fire for his offensive choice of festival fashion after he was photographed at  Coachella wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words 'Eat Sleep Rape Repeat'. The snapshot, which shows the man giving the peace sign as he flaunts his controversial shirt  at the festival held in Indio, California, sparked outrage after it was shared on Twitter on Sunday by Jemayel Khawaja, the managing editor of Vice's music and culture channel Thump. 'This guy wins the award for worst fashion/lifestyle choices @coachella. I'm not easy to offend, but this is sh**** [sic],' he tweeted along with the picture. Tasteless choice: An unidentified concert goer has come under fire for wearing a T-shirt featuring the words 'Eat Sleep Rape Repeat' (pictured) to Coachella on Sunday . First person account: The offensive photograph was shared by Jemayel Khawaja, the managing editor for Vice's music and culture channel Thump . The distasteful choice of words on the concert goer's shirt are thought to be a play on the Fatboy Slim song Eat Sleep Rave Repeat, which was released in 2013. '@JemayelK I thought at first this said ""eat sleep rave repeat"" until I read it carefully. Wtf [sic],' one critic commented on Jemayel's post. Another added: '@JemayelK @hannahgais @coachella can't even understand why someone would think that's funny... Or wearable in public [sic].' There were some who were willing to give the unidentified man the benefit of the doubt however, suggesting that the image may have been edited in order to make the garment appear more offensive than it actually was. Shameful shirt: Many commenters on Twitter wrote that they were shocked that someone would wear such an offensive top in public . Misspelling: Sam Houston questioned whether the shirt was real or not, hoping that the unidentified male's shirt was meant to say 'Rage' instead of 'Rape' Shout out: Meanwhile, Ben Gomori chose to insult the wearer of the shirt, calling him a 'F****** p****' '@JemayelK @coachella Is that real? I imagine it was meant to say “RAGE”? [sic],' one critic asked, while someone else added: '@JemayelK please say that's photoshopped?? [sic]' But Jemayel confirmed that he had taken the snapshot and seen the shirt with his own two eyes after one Twitter user asked: 'Before I jump on the appropriate rage wagon, did you take this picture yourself?' 'Yeah I did. Rage away,' he replied. The shirt, which doesn’t appear to be sold online, may have been custom-made for the event. Meanwhile, someone else confirmed that another Coachella reveler had taken to Twitter on Sunday to share their disgust after running into the man in the controversial T-shirt. Fashion faux pas: Another Twitter user revealed that she also saw the man wearing the controversial T-shirt . Shake it off: But not everyone was upset by the shirt. This person criticized Jemayel and told him to focus on 'real issues' 'The most inappropriate shirt at #Coachella goes to the guy wearing one that says ""Eat Sleep Rape Repeat"" - what the actual f***? [sic]' she wrote. Although not everyone agreed with a majority of the public's outrage. One Twitter commented on Jemayel's photo, writing: 'If this offends you, you're a p****. Grow a sack and focus on real issues, not feminist honeypot garbage.' Amid the debate over the questionable T-shirt, the first weekend of Coachella came to a close last night after Madonna planted a kiss on Drake, who looked horrified after the impromptu make-out session. The music festival will start again on Friday with performances from ACDC, Azealia Banks, Alabama Shakes and more.

"Paypal said that the devices (stock image pictured) would be powered by stomach acid and include mini computers . PayPal is developing a new generation of edible passwords which stay lodged in your stomach to let you log in. Jonathan Leblanc, the company’s top developer, said that the devices would be powered by stomach acid and include mini computers. He said that technology had become so advanced that it allowed ‘true integration with the human body’. The next wave of passwords will be edible, ingestible or injectable and will remove the need for what he called ‘antiquated’ ways of confirming your identity, such as fingerprint scanning. Typing in a password will become a thing of the past too, he added. Mr Leblanc, the Global Head of Developer Evangelism at PayPal, said in a presentation called ‘Kill All Passwords’ that he wants to ‘put users in charge of their own security’. He said that passwords as they are now were not working and that users need to ‘harden it with something physical behind it’. Edible capsules could check the person’s glucose levels or blood pressure before beaming out encrypted data, the Wall Street Journal reported. Other possibilities include silicon chips which are put under the skin and ‘wearable computer tattoos’ which send information via a wireless connection. A diagram of a chip used in his presentation shows a device that has sensors, a wireless transmitter, photo detectors, a power coil and a temperature sensor. Mr Leblanc said PayPal was currently carrying out hackathons to develop vein recognition technologies and heartbeat recognition bands to go round a person’s wrist. But he cautioned that the company has no immediate plans to use such devices. Jonathan Leblanc, the company’s top developer, said that passwords as they are now were not working and that users need to ‘harden it with something physical behind it’ instead of typing it into a given computer field . Mr Leblanc said: ‘I can’t speculate as to what PayPal will do in the future, but we’re looking at new techniques – we do have fingerprint scanning that is being worked on right now – so we’re definitely looking at the identity field’. In a statement PayPal later said that Leblanc's comments were meant as blue skies thinking and that the company was not actually developing edible passwords. A spokeswoman said: 'We have no plans to develop injectable or edible verification systems. 'It's clear that passwords as we know them will evolve and we aim to be at the forefront of those developments. We were a founding member of the FIDO alliance, and the first to implement fingerprint payments with Samsung. 'New PayPal-driven innovations such as one touch payments make it even easier to remove the friction from shopping. We’re always innovating to make life easier and payments safer for our customers no matter what device or operating system they are using.' Edible passwords would be the latest breakthrough in biometrics after it emerged that a new app lets you use your face to log in to a website instead of using a password. True Key takes a photo of your face with the computer’s camera and stores it for later use. When you want to use a password-protected website such as your email, the app scans your face and matches it with its records - removing the need for a password. Security experts have long bemoaned how easy it is to break passwords, not least because one of the most popular is the word ‘password’. The most widely used in 2014 was '123456' followed by ‘password’ and '12345678', according to one survey. Another problem is that the average person has to remember 19 passwords but one in three said they struggled to remember them all.","Company developing a  password that stays lodged in your stomach .

"A roofing boss has alleged to be a love cheat on his own company website - when his furious ex-girlfriend altered the page to shame him. Lisa Morgan, 40, a legal secretary, amended the site she had set up for former boyfriend Sean Meade, 45, to claim he had been unfaithful. Visitors to the Top of the World Roofing website are told it has 'ceased trading at present' as the boss was 'unfortunately found out to be cheating yet again'. Lisa Morgan, 40, altered the Top of the World Roofing site to expose her cheating ex boyfriend, Sean Meade . Miss Morgan said the updated site had brought in more views than ever before. Speaking to the Sun, she said: 'I changed it to stop other women falling for his charm.' The couple met after they got chatting on a flight home from Turkey in August. The relationship escalated quickly and the roofing boss moved in to Miss Morgan's house in Chatham, Kent. But she said she grew suspicious when he started to stay out all night, not returning home. She said she checked his phone bill and found calls to another woman. She also contacted his estranged wife Joanne - who told her he had cheated on her as well. She said: 'When I started digging, I realised he's lived in different women's houses not paying a penny and moving from one to the next for years so I thought, you know what, this can stop here. 'There are kids I didn't even know existed and the more I was digging the more I was like ""oh my God I don't even know the person I've been dating"" and that's how it all came about. 'I started going back through, thinking things aren't adding up when he was going missing. 'A girl rang me out of the blue and said she'd been seeing him. But he completely convinced me that she just a nutter who knows him, but then a few weeks later, when he was going missing once a week still, I thought things aren't adding up.' She then decided to change the webpage. 'It's my website, I bought the domain name, made him a nice website because he can't read and write', she said. 'I did his website then I thought you know what this goes back all that time so I just thought it's all over his truck, the name of his firm, that he drives so I wanted to oust him.' On the webpage, it explains how Mr Meade's address 'changes every few months', as does his phone number . The website now says how he was 'dumped and this resulted in him having to woo a new woman and quick as he was effectively homeless.' It adds: 'He was fortunate enough to find someone to take him in within days of dating.' On the sidebar of the page, under 'address' it reads 'changes every few months - moves from one woman's house to the next'. Today, Miss Morgan continued to shame her former boyfriend by posting a series of YouTube clips of his answer phone messages where he issues an apology. Mr Meade, of Orpington, Kent, told MailOnline: 'She's trying to ruin someone's life. If that's what someone wants to do, I will carry on, it's not affecting my life. 'If anyone sees the website, it just shows what she is capable of. I hope she finds happiness in her life. She should really get out more. 'She's just a lunatic and it was a crazy six months. I'm not the only person to have cheated on her, but what does that say about her?' Confirming his new relationship, he said: 'It's not a new person. I've known her for all my life, but she (Lisa) is trying to ruin my life.' He added how he was not yet divorced as his estranged wife 'won't do it yet'. His estranged wife, Joanne, 35, who lives in Weald, Sevenoaks, told the Sun: 'I think it's great what she's done. It serves him right.'","Lisa Morgan, 40, amended site to claim her boyfriend had been unfaithful .

"Conrad Clitheroe, left, and Gary Cooper, right, were thrown in jail after being arrested for writing down aircraft registration numbers in Dubai . A planespotter held with two friends in an Abu Dhabi jail has run out of medicine for his serious heart condition. Conrad Clitheroe, from Stockport, is in a cell with friends Gary Cooper and Neil Munro - also from Greater Manchester. But the 54-year-old's wife says he has now run out of a blood pressure medication - and claims guards 'don't care'. None of the men have been charged with any offence since they were transferred there from Dubai. They were arrested in February at Fujairah Airport over claims they were a 'threat to national security'. They were placed in a cell on February 21, missing their flight home the next day. A judge has since extended their custody licence, which will be up again on April 12. The families of Mr Clitheroe and Mr Cooper have paid £9,000 for lawyer Naseer Hashem – but claim he has been out of touch. Mr Clitheroe's wife Valerie said: 'We haven't been able to get him for a week. The Prime Minister's office has replied saying there is nothing they can do to help. 'I only speak to Conrad once a week now – he's said he's run out of blood pressure medication but the guards don't care. 'I've asked the consulate to help but I'm worried.' The couple were planning to spend Easter in Spain. Now Mrs Clitheroe hopes her husband will be home for the next milestone – their first wedding anniversary on May 9. She added: 'I so hope he's home. We've heard nothing, the lawyer won't answer and neither will the charity Detained in Dubai. 'They are just ignoring us. I'm not doing very well at all, I'm just hoping something will happen next Sunday. But if it's another extension I just don't know how the guys will cope.'

'We are providing consular assistance to the individuals and their families.' Mrs Clitheroe says the three friends were driving past Fujairah Airport, spotting planes and taking notes when they were arrested.

"A man charged with first-degree murder in the killing of three Muslim college students in Durham, North Carolina, can face a death penalty trial, a judge ruled on Monday. Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson Jr. said prosecutors had two aggravating factors and that Craig Stephen Hicks is 'death penalty qualified.' Hicks is charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the February 10 killings of 23-year-old Deah Shaddy Barakat; his wife, 21-year-old Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha; and her sister, 19-year-old Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. Scroll down for video . A superior court judge in North Carolina ruled on Monday that Craig Hicks is 'death penalty qualified' after he was charged with first-degree murder in the killing of three Muslim college students . Prosecutors said Hicks confessed and was arrested with the murder weapon. Ballistics matched the handgun to shell casings recovered at the apartment and there was gunshot residue on his hands and one of the victim's blood was on his pants, prosecutors said. Police say Hicks, 46, appears to have been motivated by a long-running dispute over parking spaces at the Chapel Hill condominium complex where he lived in the same building as Barakat and his wife. The victims' families are adamant that they were targeted because they were Muslims and have pushed for hate-crime charges. The FBI is conducting what it has called a 'parallel preliminary inquiry' to the homicide investigation to determine whether any federal laws were violated, including hate crime statutes. Search warrants filed by Chapel Hill police said Barakat was shot in the head near the entrance to his condo. The two women were found in or near the kitchen. Murdered: Deah Shaddy Barakat, a dental student at the University of North Carolina; (left) his wife, 21-year-old Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha (center) and her sister, 19-year-old Rezan (right) were gunned down on February 10 . Eight spent shell casings were found at the crime scene, investigators said. Earlier search warrants listed a dozen firearms recovered from the condo unit Hicks shared with his wife, in addition to the handgun he had with him when he turned himself in after the shootings. Hicks, who was unemployed and studying to become a paralegal, posted online that he was an atheist and a staunch advocate of the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Neighbors described him as an angry man who had frequent confrontations over parking or loud music, sometimes with a gun holstered at his hip. His social media posts often discussed firearms, including a photo posted of a .38-caliber revolver.

"If you struggle to get your child to go to school in the morning, don’t blame them - it could be your fault. Our willingness to learn - or lack thereof - is significantly influenced by our genes, according to a large study. The researchers found that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in children’s motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents. Our willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes, according to a study by Goldsmiths University in London and Ohio State University. More than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 took part in the research (stock image shown) Psychologists from Goldsmiths University of London, and Ohio State University in the US studied more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries, including the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, Russia and the US. The researchers said they were surprised by the results, believing that the twins’ shared environment - elements such as the teachers and the family that they had in common - would be a larger factor than genetics. Instead, genetics and non-shared-environment factors had the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact. Genetics and non-shared-environment factors were found to have the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact (stock image shown) A review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million children has now completely overturned this long-held stereotype. The study, which looked at data from 1914 to 2011, suggests that girls do better in school than boys - and have been doing so for at least 100 years. The research also claims that girls do better at all ages, in all subjects and all over the world. According to the data, compiled by the University of New Brunswick in Canada, girls have been outperforming boys throughout their academic careers, from infant school to secondary school. Accordingly, we should not jump to conclusions that a poor teacher or the child themselves is to blame for a lack of motivation in the classroom, the researchers said. ‘We had pretty consistent findings across these different countries with their different educational systems and different cultures,’ said Professor Stephen Petrill, of Ohio State University. ‘It was surprising. The knee-jerk reaction is to say someone is not properly motivating the student, or the child himself is responsible. ‘We found that there are personality differences that people inherit that have a major impact on motivation. ‘That doesn’t mean we don’t try to encourage and inspire students, but we have to deal with the reality of why they are different.’ The results don’t mean there is a specific gene for how much children enjoy learning, he added, but they suggest a complex process, involving many genes and gene-environment interactions that help influence a child’s motivation to learn. The study will be published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.","Willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes .

"Teenagers will be encouraged to learn foreign languages by talking about tattoos, music festivals, YouTube and rap music under the latest GCSE shake-up . Teenagers will be encouraged to learn foreign languages by talking about tattoos, music festivals, YouTube and rap music under the latest GCSE shake-up. Exam board officials yesterday unveiled a draft syllabus for 14 to 16-year-olds which they said would ‘make content more contemporary’. Some students will be asked to study a review of a gritty 15-rated foreign film, while others will look at Spanish tweets on the Olympic Games. The proposals, announced by Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations (OCR), aim to rid classrooms of ‘tired phrases’ which some pupils now see as outdated. The board said children were ‘uninspired’ by conventional topics like ‘my school day’, ‘my pencil case’ and ‘my family’. It said the new French, German and Spanish GCSEs would allow pupils to talk about their interests using updated content. Exam board officials also hope to ‘bring back linguistic skills’ by focusing on grammar as a component of an indispensable language ‘toolkit’. OCR languages expert Katherine Smith said: ‘This entails moving away from working too long on a clichéd topic until a student is bored with it, to working on more appealing subjects, and with an all-important shift in emphasis on the skills that they can transfer across content. ‘Current GCSE specifications have focused on preparing coursework which is more about the theme than learning the building blocks of a language. ‘This has de-skilled students and led to ‘topic fatigue’. Our new approach should fundamentally improve both the student’s enjoyment and their linguistic ability.’ The course content, which has now been submitted to Ofqual for approval, would be studied by pupils from 2016. The board said it had disposed of old topics including ‘My holiday’, ‘Aurélie and Fabian go to town’ or ‘Mathilde’s school day’. One teacher at an OCR teacher consultation said: ‘Students are not really going to meet somebody in a café in Paris and describe their entire family.’ Pupils would no longer be forced to recite phrases like ‘I have a grapefruit every morning’ and instead would be able to express views such as ‘In my opinion a discreet tattoo is an expression of your personality’. In the new draft German GCSE, there is a film review of the thriller Run Lola Run, which is rated 15 and features some mild violence. In the Spanish GCSE, students will be asked to look at tweets on the Olympic Games. Exam board officials yesterday unveiled a draft syllabus for 14 to 16-year-olds which they said would ‘make content more contemporary’ Other proposed content includes listening to a radio broadcast on rap music and discussing online gaming and YouTube. Potential topics include Cannes Film Festival, volunteering abroad and foreign food. Experts said the new content would take inspiration from methods used to teach English as a foreign language. Literature extracts will be also be studied at the request of the Department for Education, including passages from an Ionesco play. OCR also wants to abandon inflexible vocabulary lists and encourage pupils to use a smart app to help them memorise words. Ms Smith added: ‘While language teachers are pulling their hair out as their student numbers decline with languages not prioritised by the current system, captains of industry are also deeply frustrated. ‘We are passionate about getting these three core language GCSEs right to help the UK build a generation of people with the language skills that are so desperately needed.’","Exam board officials yesterday unveiled draft syllabus for kids aged 14-16 .

"A 21-year-old man with depression has made the most gut-wrenching final goodbye video to his family, telling them not to blame themselves and reassuring them there is nothing they could have done to stop him taking his own life. While the chilling song 'Goodbye My Lover' by James Blunt is playing in the background, the distressing three-minute footage shows Chris Ball repeatedly saying that no one should take the blame for his disease and expressing his unconditional love for his mother, four siblings and his girlfriend. On September 14 last year, Chris's brother Jayden - who is only one year younger - and their stepfather found Chris's body along with a USB stick containing the video sitting on top of a piece of paper which simply said: 'Mum and Dad, please watch.' His family have shared the heartbreaking video publicly to raise awareness of the crippling disease, which takes the lives of more young Australians than car accidents and skin cancer, as part of a petition to call for more beds for suicidal youths in hospitals. Scroll down for video . Chris Ball made made the most heartbreaking final goodbye video to his family before taking his own life . Jayden (centre pictured with siblings Matthew, Lara, Maddy and Chris from left to right) found his brother after the devastating tragedy . Chris starts off saying to the camera that this could be his last goodbye and then tells no one to blame themselves because 'depression is a disease and I'm pretty weak-hearted - it doesn't take much for me to get emotional,' he said. 'I just want you to know that I love you all and there was nothing you could have done - it's just me, my personality it's who I am.' He then goes onto talk about his ongoing battle with depression. 'I've been feeling lonely for a while, I know I could get better - I keep trying to tell myself that but I just can't see it,' he said. 'I use alcohol a little bit to help me to get through but if anyone puts on this USB - I love you - there is nothing you could really do.' Chris then signs off by naming all of the most important people in his life - his parents, four siblings and his girlfriend, Holly. 'Holly don't blame yourself - it's not your fault - same with my family - Mum, Dad, Maddy, Lara, Matt, Jay - all of you just didn't do it alright? This is me, myself - I love you - goodbye.' Chris (left) was taken by his mother Kerrie (right) to the hospital 11 days earlier but was sent home with 10 Valium because there was a shortage of beds . The five people in Kerrie's family who committed suicide: her nephew Andrew (top left), her brother John (bottom left) and son Chris (centre), her sister and Andrew's mum - Lenore (right) and her sister Leeann (bottom right) If anyone knows about the devastating impact of suicide it's Kerrie Keepa who has lost her brother, two sisters, nephew and now her son, Chris, to depression. Kerrie said her son would still be with her today if Chris had not been sent home from Redland hospital in Brisbane 11 days earlier because he was told there were not enough beds available. A Metro South Health spokeswoman said it would be inappropriate to provide any details of Chris's care while the coroner was still investigating the matter. 'However, Metro South Addiction and Mental Health Service did provide extensive support to Mr Ball and sufficient mental health beds are available within the Metro South Health area,' she said. On September 3, Kerrie received a hysterical phone call from her son who said he had deliberately cut himself multiple times on his leg. 'We had to wait for four hours and then a doctor gave him 10 Valium and told him to get a good night's sleep and that somebody would contact him in a week or two from the outpatients' department,' she said. 'Then he said to me ""you can look after him can't you?"". 'I said to him ""please don't take this lightly - there is a history of mental illness in my family"" and he just said that there were no beds.' Chris said in his video that his family and girlfriend were not to blame for his 'disease' 'I've been feeling lonely for a while, I know I could get better - I keep trying to tell myself that but I just can't see it,' he said in his video . Although Chris had been suffering from depression for the past two and a half years and had spent two weeks in the hospital during that time after making an attempt on his life, Kerrie said it was the worst state that she had seen her son in. 'I took him to my house and he was so withdrawn and crying the whole time,' she said. 'His best friend Adam and I were on 24 hour suicide watch. 'It was the worst time of my life - I have never seen him so low.' Ten days later, Chris told his mother that Holly was picking him up and taking him to his place so he could have a few drinks with his friends. The next morning, Kerrie was unable to get hold of Chris in her break at work so she asked her husband and Jayden to check on him. 'They heard music but he didn't answer the door so they broke it down and it was Jayden who found him.' Only a year apart in age, Jayden and Chris were not only brothers but best friends. 'Jayden and my husband were having terrible nightmares - Jay kept seeing visions of Chris as he saw him when he broke the door down,' Kerrie said . 'The next day Queensland Mental Health offered us counselling - I just can't get my head around that they wouldn't help Chris when he was alive but offered us counselling after he died.' Before Chris became unwell two years ago, he was a happy and outgoing boy . Chris with his girlfriend Holly and his beloved dog, Bear, in happier times . Kerrie, who works for the health department as an aged care nurse, has started a petition to call on the government to urgently implement emergency suicide training in hospitals and dedicate more beds to suicidal youths in hospitals. 'I will hand deliver the petition to Canberra myself and hope the bloody politicians listen,'she said. 'Mental health is rampant in my family so if any other family members show any sign they have no hope. 'I don't know if I could cope losing another child I think it would be the thing that breaks me - my days are filled with fear.' No matter what happens, Kerrie will always treasure the fond memories of her beautiful son. 'He was the most beautiful boy - he really loved his family - he would walk in and say ""I love you Mother Duck"" and give me a big hug and kiss,' she said. 'Before he became unwell - he was happy and outgoing with a smile that lit up the whole room.' To sign Kerrie's petition go to change.org.

"What was supposed to be a gentle splash around in the shallows suddenly turned into a much scarier prospect when holiday-makers came face to face with a shark in New Zealand on Saturday. Papamoa Beach, a popular Bay of Plenty destination, was an idyllic haven for swimmers until a shark came into the shore, swimming around in only a few feet of water. Onlookers initially got out of the sea sharpish, but soon returned to take photographs and videos of the 2.5 metre bronze whaler as it eventually swam away. Scroll down for video . Once the the 2.5 metre bronze whaler appeared soon everyone was on the beach . Onlookers soon had their mobile phones out to take videos and photographs .

'Look at it, it's huge,' shouted a boy from the shore. But before long the shark had seen enough and turned back out to sea. The New Zealand Herald reports that shark sightings have become commonplace around the New Zealand coastline this summer, including close encounters with great white sharks in Auckland. Children could be heard chatting and laughing happily on the shore as the fish swam around . Two shark attacks left a surfer and fisherman with serious injuries. In February, a surfer was mauled by a shark off the Southland coast. Headlines were made around the world in December, when a junior Southland doctor ended up stitching up his own wound after being attacked by a shark while fishing near Cosy Nook, off the south coast. The shark soon had enough of all the attention and swam back out to sea .

"Former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell who has been found guilty of corruption now says she did not receive a fair trial. Her attorneys argued Monday in a 101-page court filing that Mrs McDonnell's public corruption conviction should be overturned because it was based on an overly broad definition of bribery. McDonnell and her husband, former Gov. Bob McDonnell, were convicted in a joint trial in September of accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams in exchange for promoting his company's nutritional supplements. Scroll down for video . Last-ditch effort: Former Virginia first lady (pictured in February) Maureen McDonnell's attorneys argued that her public corruption conviction should be overturned because it was based on an overly broad definition of bribery . Downfall: McDonnell, pictured in February, and her husband, former Gov. Bob McDonnell, were convicted in a joint trial in September of accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams . Among the gifts were almost $20,000 worth of designer clothing and accessories for Maureen McDonnell, vacations, golf outings and $15,000 for a daughter's wedding. Bob McDonnell was sentenced in February to two years in prison and his wife to one year and one day, but they remain free while they pursue separate appeals. Maureen McDonnell's legal team argued that her trial was unfair due a number of mistakes made by the presiding federal district court judge. The lawyers stated in their brief that 'at the very least,' Maureen McDonnell should be granted a new trial. Maureen McDonnell was a onetime Washington Redskins cheerleader who was known for her work with military families. Her father was in the Marines and her husband was in the Army. Bob McDonnell was a former state attorney general who became chairman of the Republican Governors Association and he was widely considered a possible Mitt Romney running mate before the scandal broke. A six-week jury trial exposed details of the McDonnells' strained marriage, and detailed the loans and gifts they took from Williams. 'How can a person become so bedazzled by material possessions that she can no longer see the difference between what's appropriate and inappropriate,' Spencer said. Fighting back tears, Maureen McDonnell apologized to her family and Virginians. Disgraced: Bob McDonnell, pictured outside US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in January, was sentenced in February to two years in prison . Lawyers for both Bob McDonnell and his wife argued in separate briefs that the favors he did for Williams did not amount to 'official acts' covered by federal bribery law . 'I would ask in your sentence today that you consider the punishment I've already received,' she said. 'My marriage is broken, my family is hurting and my reputation is in shatters.' At Bob McDonnell's sentencing, Judge James Spencer described Williams — who testified under immunity for the prosecution — as a 'serpent' that Maureen let into the Executive Mansion. Maureen McDonnell, who according to her lawyer had developed a 'crush' on Williams, said Spencer was right. 'The venom from that snake has poisoned my marriage, has poisoned my family and has poisoned the commonwealth that I love,' she said. 'I opened the door, and I blame no one but myself.' Lawyers for both Bob McDonnell and his wife argued in separate briefs that the favors he did for Williams did not amount to 'official acts' covered by federal bribery law. According to Maureen McDonnell's appeal, Judge Spencer gave the jury an overly broad definition of 'official act,' and in what her lawyers described as an 'Orwellian moment,' the prosecution extended it to the governor's wife to prove conspiracy between the spouses, even though she was never a government official, reported the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Her sentence was less than the 18 months sought by prosecutors. Defense attorneys had asked for probation and 4,000 hours of community service.","Maureen McDonnell's attorneys argued her corruption conviction should be overturned because it was based on overly broad definition of bribery .

"A Pennsylvania couple have been killed after their 1923 Model T Ford convertible skidded off the roadway and flipped over. Ralph Cramer, 70, and his wife, Lynn, 59, were returning home from the Creekside Café in Mount Joy at about 9 p.m. on Sunday when the accident occurred.

Manheim Borough Police Chief Joseph Stauffer told Lancaster Online that the vehicle left the road, flipped over and landed upside-down in a ditch. It was not immediately known who was driving or if the couple had worn seat belts. The top was down when the wreck occurred. Stauffer says there's evidence the vehicle started to skid at a slight left turn, then went off the road and hit an embankment near a barn. The vehicle had been rebuilt or restored, with new elements. 'There are no indicators of what caused the accident yet,' said Stauffer. The investigation continues and Manheim police are asking anyone with information to come forward.

"Andrew O'Clee, 36, hid his secret second family from his first wife and has been jailed for eight months, pictured outside Chichester Crown Court yesterday . A bigamist was caught out when his first wife discovered his secret second marriage – on Facebook. 'Shameless liar' Andrew O'Clee, 36, wed Michelle Agbulos – and later tied the knot again with another woman. But Michelle, 39, uncovered the deception when she came across footage of him completing the ice bucket charity challenge on the social networking site. Serial cheat O'Clee had tried to cover his tracks by claiming he was involved in a fraud case and had been put into the witness protection programme which meant he had to live in a 'safe house' for long periods. Blinded by her belief in his honesty, Michelle allowed herself to be taken in by his elaborate lies, agreeing not to tell her family and friends what was happening. Yesterday the former soldier was jailed for eight months after a court heard about the web of 'lies and forgery' lasting four years. O'Clee tied the knot with first wife Michelle in 2008. But while they were trying for a baby together, he had already started his double life with a new woman. He later turned up at the birth of his daughter, Amelia, and cut the umbilical cord – before telling his wife he had to leave with a police escort. But instead of heading to a so-called safe house, he would leave their rented flat in Ealing, West London to go back to finance manager Philippa Campbell in upmarket Chiddingfold, Surrey – a 40-mile journey away. He started the affair with Philippa after claiming his first marriage had ended after he caught shopworker Michelle being unfaithful. He married again in August 2013 – even forging divorce documents so his family would attend the second wedding. O'Clee's lavish illegal nuptials took place in St John the Baptist church in Kirdford, West Sussex, before the reception at Russets Country House, near their detached £575,000 home. He began his affair with his second wife Philippa (right) in 2011 - while he and his first wife were trying for a baby, pictured together outside Chichester Crown Court yesterday . His first wife Michelle (pictured) revealed that he showed up late at the birth of their child and said he had to leave with police . But the deception was uncovered last August when Michelle discovered a video of him on Facebook completing the ice bucket challenge – where people are filmed being drenched in freezing water for charity. It was captioned 'Uncle Andrew and Auntie Philippa'. The post led her to photos of his second wedding, which she reported to police. Yesterday O'Clee was jailed after admitting bigamy at Chichester Crown Court. But second wife Philippa, 30, has vowed to stay with him. 2000: Andrew O'Clee met Michelle . 2008: The pair married in West Acton in 2008 . 2011: Couple began trying for a baby around the same time he started affair with Philippa . 2012: O'Clee got engaged to Philippa and forged a decree absolute for his first marriage . 2013: He married Philippa in St John the Baptist church in Kirdford, West Sussex . 2014: Michelle and Andrew's daughter was born . 2014: O'Clee was arrested in September . Judge Christopher Parker, QC, told O'Clee: 'You began to develop a complicated and absurd lie. 'All of which was a complete nonsense but it enabled you to lead a double life. 'Bigamy is an offence against the institution of marriage, an institution founded on complete trust. This was simply a selfish act.' To avoid detection, O'Clee told Michelle he had been placed in witness protection and had to live in a safe house as his life was in danger. She told the court: 'Thinking back, as I do every single minute of every single day, I had no reason not to trust Andrew. 'I was told he would have to be taken to a safe house with his colleagues for his and my own safety. 'He was taken to a safe house every night and I wasn't allowed to know the location. 'I was told by him not to tell my family or friends. I became paranoid and constantly fearful for my safety. 'Looking back I feel completely stupid and naive for not thinking something was wrong. I believed my life was in danger.' Michelle went into labour 18 months after he began his safe-house lie. The bigamist married his second wife in August 2013, pictured is Philippa's Facebook page with a photograph from their wedding . The bigamist has since deleted his Facebook page and removed the incriminating Ice Bucket Challenge video . But O'Clee took five hours to turn up – and then cut the umbilical cord before saying he had to leave with police. She added: 'The day I found out about the bigamy was the day my world fell apart and the violent betrayal unfolded. Bigamy is a crime under section 57 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. If someone is caught entering into another marriage whilst still being legally married and is convicted on indictment, they could face a fine or a jail term of up to seven years. A custodial sentence can be ordered when one party has been deceived and suffered injury or if the offence has been committed for money to evade immigration. 'To add insult to injury he instructed me to take a paternity test.' Defending, Patrick Duffy said O'Clee – who worked for business services provider ISS – has 'abandonment issues' because his parents split when he was 15. He said second wife Philippa planned to continue her relationship with him and wished 'to draw a line under this and get on with her life'. O'Clee admitted to one count of bigamy and is expected to serve half of his sentence in custody. Michelle is currently staying with her sister Jasmine Agbulus and her partner Sean in a house in Lancashire and refused to comment about her two-timing husband. She used to live in a rented flat in Ealing, West London, with O'Clee and the landlord became so suspicious of his behaviour that he hired a private investigator to check on the pair. O'Clee told Michelle he was in Witness Protection as his life was in danger and then moved into a new house in Chiddingfold, Surrey, (pictured) with Philippa . His illegal wedding to Philippa took place in St John the Baptist church in Kirdford, West Sussex, in 2013 . The owners were alerted to the fact that nobody was living in the flat when neighbours complained about a foul smell coming from the property - which turned out to be rotting food in the fridge. A spokesperson for the letting agents said: 'I'm glad that he's been caught out. We knew there was something strange going on. 'The fact he didn't want us speaking to his wife was very weird. 'We got in touch with Philippa and she said, 'Yes that's my husband' but she knew nothing about the flat. 'He called us and said, 'Don't speak to Philippa anymore it's a sensitive matter.' O'Clee cleared out all their belongings, including his old army uniforms, from the flat in October last year, according to the spokesman. Neighbours living at the block of flats in Ealing said they remember Michelle, as well as her 'energetic' husband. One neighbour said: 'Yes I heard he had multiple wives. He was always on the go and very energetic.' Another added: 'Michelle used to live here. She would always say hi when I saw her in the street. It's awful what he did to her.' O'Clee and Philippa celebrated their wedding reception at Russets Country House, near their Surrey home .","Andrew O'Clee, 36, met first wife Michelle in 2000 and they married in 2008 .

"Samantha says she thinks she's 'fabulous' I sprung out of bed this morning and examined myself in the full-length bedroom mirror, and I can honestly say that there’s never a day when I would rather be someone else. The woman looking back at me? She’s gorgeous, intelligent and fabulous! Quite simply, I adore who I am – inside and out. I’m no narcissist – I’m perfectly aware I have flaws, but they’re deliciously wrapped up in the very unique moi. I’ve grown to love my nose that tilts ever so slightly to the right, my hourglass figure that boasts slightly-too-large hips, and my green-sometimes-grey eyes. I’m a size 10, but even so I could do with dropping 10lbs. But as long as I don’t mind, who cares? Which is why I’m utterly peeved about Dove's latest campaign results. How humiliating to film women in a public place ‘choosing’ to walk through a door marked either ‘beautiful’ or ‘average’. Talk about putting the meeker sex on the spot. It's hardly a big surprise the survey discovered 96 per cent of women chose the 'average' option. From my experience, most women would rather strut out in public as naked as the day they were born than  freely admit that not only are they good-looking, but they’re also (whisper it) beautiful. Why is this? Numerous university studies have been carried out (I know this because their authors send them to me) and they have all come up with the same conclusion – it’s self-protection. If women don’t fit in with their (usually older, fatter, less attractive) female peers, then those who are good-looking won’t get hired for jobs by the fairer sex; their careers will stall if their boss is female and they’ll routinely receive their P45 for nothing more heinous than boasting a lovely smile. And this is what really exasperates me: it isn’t society that won’t let us admit that we’re beautiful – it’s the very same members of our own sex who hold us back. Even though I’m an un-Botoxed, un-surgically enhanced 44-year-old, I would have marched through the entrance marked beautiful without giving it a second thought. I’m extremely comfortable in my skin. Haters: Samantha has received death threats for standing up and saying 'I'm beautiful' This confidence annoys the heck out of other women. You might have read what I’ve written about this problem, in an article published in April 2012. It received almost 5,000 comments online and suddenly I was a global name. The earth turned on its axis as one woman - me - was up for admitting: ‘I like how I look and other women have a problem with it.’ Since then I’ve been ridiculed, received death threats, told I’m off my rocker. Just last week I received yet another email from a woman titled ‘please read me’ which went on at length to tell me I was ‘an arrogant, cocky woman’. Little wonder only four per cent of women were brave enough to walk through a door marked 'beautiful' in the Dove campaign. Critical: Samantha claims Dove's campaign works because it exploits our need to act modestly . My personal take on this experiment is devastatingly simple: we’d rather fit in and humiliate ourselves by claiming to be average than give our fellow 'fairer' sex any more ammunition than we've got already against each other. My view is supported by the thousands of emails I’ve received over the years from women routinely humiliated, bullied and singled out by their female peers for daring to think they look good. The emails depressingly cover the same ground wherever they live in the world. Whether they’re teenagers at school in the US, middle-aged mums in Australia or women in the workplace in the UK: if they rate themselves, display confidence, or dare to say they look good they get bullied or socially ostracised. A recent plea from a young women in how to deal with her critics was this: . ‘I have just looked up your article, it’s my life in black and white. I tried dressing down, not wearing too much make up, unfashionable clothes and flat shoes. Reaching out: Samantha receives letters from teens who get bullied for being beautiful . 'I am confident and friendly, men open doors for me, they are polite. But some women are awful to me as a result of it. 'I am fed up with it, angry about it, annoyed with it. I feel like a complete nothing and nobody; maybe that’s what I should be to be accepted.’ Another woman was banned by her mean-minded (older) female boss for wearing heels to work: they were a ‘health hazard’. What health and safety offense could she cause wearing stilettos while working as a receptionist? The mind boggles. How awful that these women are treated this way. It's little wonder so many of the fairer sex refuse to acknowledge that they are good-looking, which is ironic because so many do it in private – behind the anonymity of social media. We know how to photograph ourselves well thanks to selfies and social media sites such as Instagram. We can iron out wrinkles, banish zits, magically award ourselves a thigh gap or hip dip. In the Dove campaign, women were asked to choose between a door marked 'beautiful' or 'average' Yet to admit to the world ‘yeah, I look good’ means we risk incurring the wrath of other women. We have to be display modesty at all times - which is why Dove's campaign works brilliantly. I’m not some superior Type A female who doesn’t recognise that there are some who don’t feel happy about themselves. Yet such feelings of low self-esteem seem to go hand in hand with the desire to criticise and target others in order to restore an illusion of self worth. Any female trolls ousted usually blame their behaviour on a crisis of confidence. Ironically, they are the only ones who can help themselves - but picking on others isn't the way to go about it. In 2015, we desperately need a seismic shift in female societal thinking so that women can say loud and proud that they’re beautiful - and not fear reprisals. Otherwise cynical advertising campaigns - in a bid to flog toiletries - will continue to exploit us just like this one has 'beautifully' done.","Author of 'Why women hate me for being beautiful' article speaks out .

"1. Heavy drinking males: Scientists at Sheffield University have identified six different types of obese person (file image) There are six different types of obese person, scientists have today revealed. The distinction, they hope, will allow for tailor-made treatments to help different obese people combat their weight. Researchers at the University of Sheffield analysed people with a body mass index of 30 or more - a recognised measure of obesity. They found obese people fall into one of six categories: . The scientists said their findings suggest that clinicians and policy makers should not target obese people as a whole, rather treat them according to the 'type' of obese person they are. Dr Mark Green, who led the study, said: 'Policies designed to tackle obesity and encourage healthier lifestyles often target individuals just because they are obese. 'But a focus on just the group as a whole is not very efficient. We are all different and different health promotion approaches work for different people. 'Our research showed that those in the groups that we identified are likely to need very different services, and will respond very differently to different health promotion policies. Scroll down for video . 'In the future, we hope that GPs will keep in mind these six groups when offering advice to their patients.' BMI has long been used to measure individuals in terms of their height and weight, but does not account for variation across other factors such as health, demographic and behavioural characteristics. The team at Sheffield looked at health-related variables, including whether individuals reported conditions like fatigue, pain, insomnia, depression, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease or cancer. 2. Young healthy females: The scientists said their findings suggest that clinicians and policy makers should not target obese people as a whole, rather treat them according to the 'type' of obese person they are. The largest cluster was 'younger healthy females' - also the youngest group (file image) 3. The affluent and healthy elderly: This group was the least deprived cluster and had positive health characteristics - although the group included a large proportion with high blood pressure - and above average alcohol consumption (file image) Demographic variables accounted for were age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation, while well-being was assessed by asking people how satisfied they were with their lives on a scale of nought to 10. Whether participants smoked and the number of units of alcohol they consumed in the previous week was also taken into consideration. 4. The physically sick but happy elderly: They had a higher prevalence of chronic health problems including high blood pressure (file image) As was whether or not they engaged in active weight management - going to slimming clubs, for example - and whether they made a conscious effort to eat more healthily. Researchers discovered the largest cluster was 'younger healthy females' - also the youngest group. They were the group most likely to display positive health characteristics, and engaged in some healthy behaviours. 'Heavy drinking males' showed similar characteristics, but consumed a high level of alcohol. They were less likely to be managing their weight, though did report above average levels of physical exercise and walking. The 'unhappy anxious middle-aged' group was primarily female, had poor mental health and reported high levels of insomnia, anxiety, depression and fatigue. Their sense of well-being was relatively low, but they did engage in healthy physical activity and weight management, and had the lowest alcohol consumption. The final three clusters captured different patterns among older people. The 'affluent healthy elderly' was the least deprived cluster and had positive health characteristics - although the group included a large proportion with high blood pressure - and above average alcohol consumption. The 'physically sick but happy elderly' group had a higher prevalence of chronic health conditions -including osteoarthritis, diabetes and high blood pressure - but exhibited low levels of anxiety and depression. 5. The unhappy and anxious middle-aged: This group was primarily female, had poor mental health and reported high levels of insomnia, anxiety, depression and fatigue (file image) 6. Those with the poorest health: This group was found to be the most deprived, and had the highest prevalence of  chronic health conditions. And they tended not to engage in  healthy behaviours (file image) The final group, made up of those with the 'poorest health', was the most deprived, had the highest prevalence of most chronic health conditions, and tended not to engage in healthy behaviours. It also had the highest average BMI. Researchers said health professionals should assess what group obese patients might fall into and treat them accordingly. For example, for the 'unhappy anxious middle-aged' an intervention involving increasing exercise may need to be mixed with psycho-social counselling, while for those in the 'poorest health', group advice on exercise may not be reasonable and more modest goals may be needed. Meanwhile messages about alcohol reduction could help tackle obesity in young adults. The findings are published in the Journal of Public Health.","University of Sheffield study found six different type of obese person .

"US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents in Colombia were taking part in alleged 'sex parties' with prostitutes funded by drug cartels years earlier than previously known, U.S. lawmakers said on Tuesday. Several DEA agents were taking part in these parties in Bogota as early as 2001, said a summary of a DEA report released by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform at a hearing on the misconduct. 'This new internal report describes not one or two isolated incidents, but literally dozens of parties with prostitutes,' Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings said at the hearing, where lawmakers grilled DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart. Scroll down for videos . Several DEA agents were participating in alleged sex parties in Colombia starting in 2001 according to a new report . This news comes two weeks after a report found that at least 7 agents admitted sleeping with prostitutes while on overseas assignments . The hearing came on the heels of a separate, March 26 report by the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General that described similar allegations between 2005 and 2008. That report said 10 agents - an assistant regional director and nine special agents - had alleged sex parties on government-leased property and used taxpayer money to pay for the prostitutes. After investigation, seven of the agents admitted attending the parties and were suspended for between two and 10 days. One special agent was cleared of all wrongdoing, the report said. None of the agents was named in the report. The inspector general said it investigated allegations of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct between October 2008 and September 2012, though they declined to confirm where the alleged 'sex parties' took place. The DEA declined to comment. That report cited 'repeated allegations of DEA Special Agents ... patronizing prostitutes and frequenting a brothel while in an overseas posting.' It came in the wake of a prostitution scandal involving Secret Service agents in Cartagena, Colombia, in 2012 that damaged the agency's straitlaced reputation. Where there was alleged high-risk sexual misdeeds, security agency personnel often were not told 'until long after they occurred or were never informed, even though such behavior presents significant security risks,' the report said. The inspector general found a wide range of sex-related offenses in the case files of the FBI, DEA, ATF and US Marshals Service, including sex with prostitutes and sexual assault of minors in a report two weeks ago . House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz called the allegations regarding the DEA agents 'stunning' and urged action. Inspectors also criticized the FBI and DEA for initially refusing to provide unredacted information requested, and then providing information that was ""still incomplete."" Department of Justice spokesman Patrick Rodenbush said the department is already working with the agencies 'to ensure a zero tolerance policy on sexual harassment and misconduct is enforced and that incidents are properly reported.'","Several DEA agents were participating in alleged sex parties in Colombia starting in 2001 according to a new report .
The parties featured prostitutes paid for by drug cartels .
This news comes two weeks after a report found that at least 7 agents admitted sleeping with prostitutes while on overseas assignments .
Instead of firing or prosecuting agents, the DEA treated prostitution cases as 'local management issue' and suspended them for no more than 14 days ."
"An Uber driver who was credited with stopping a potential mass shooting in Chicago at the weekend by pulling out his own personal firearm and shooting the would-be gunman will not face any charges for his actions, a court has decided. Prosecutors say the driver with a concealed carry permit shot a 22-year-old man who opened fire on a group of pedestrians in Logan Square. Court records say the man, identified by The Washington Post as Everardo Custodio, shot at people walking in front of the driver’s vehicle on Friday night in the busy neighborhood. The driver - a 47-year-old man from the Little Italy neighborhood - then grabbed his own weapon and fired six rounds at Custodio, striking him multiple times.

"Investigators have now rescued 550 fisherman slaves from a remote Indonesian island after returning to the scene of an earlier rescue to check nobody was left behind. A dramatic rescue earlier in the week led to 210 mainly-Burmese nationals being identified, the vast majority of whom said they were desperate to leave the island village of Benjina. Those who said they wanted to stay did so because they claimed they were owed years of back pay from their bosses. An in-depth investigation by The Associated Press published last month led to the discovery of massive rights abuses in Benjina and surrounding waters. The report traced slave-caught seafood from there to Thailand where it can then enter the supply chains of some of U.S. retailers. Slaves: A dramatic rescue earlier in the week led to many of the mainly-Burmese nationals being identified, the vast majority of whom said they were desperate to leave the the island village of Benjina . Rescued: Last week, Indonesian authorities rescued around 330 migrants from Benjina, bringing them to the island of Tual, where they are now being sheltered by the government . Many of the men interviewed said they were tricked or even kidnapped before being put on boats in Thailand and taken to Indonesia. They were forced to work almost non-stop under horrendous conditions, some brutally beaten by their Thai captains when they were sick or caught resting. Last week, Indonesian authorities rescued around 330 migrants from Benjina, bringing them to the island of Tual, where they are now being sheltered by the government. Those found Thursday by a team, which included Myanmar officials, remain in Benjina. While most fisherman found in Benjina were Burmese, there also were scores of Cambodians. The toll of 550 did not include men - many of whom also were enslaved - from poor parts of Thailand. Shocking: Many of the men interviewed said they were tricked or even kidnapped before being put on boats in Thailand and taken to Indonesia . Export: The report traced slave-caught seafood from there to Thailand where it can then enter the supply chains of some of American retailers . It's unclear who will pay for the mass repatriation. A former slave now in Tual said conditions were relatively good there. He said the men are getting medical care and enough to eat, but their living quarters are cramped and many do not have a change of clothes since they left quickly with only what they were wearing. Meanwhile, Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi yesterday told reporters in her country's capital, Naypyitaw, it was up to governments 'to protect the rights of the citizens and to bring them back out of bondage.' 'That is the most obvious and very simple solution and unavoidable duty of any responsible government,' she told reporters.","Dramatic rescue led to the mainly-Burmese nationals being identified .

"A judge has sentenced an Oregon man to 10 years in prison on Monday for fatally stabbing his boyfriend, but the victim's mother says that's not long enough. Tony Lopez Lozano, 35, was charged with the August 2013 murder of his boyfriend, Brian Romo, after fatally stabbing Romo in the heart following an argument at their Oregon City home, The Oregonian reports. Lozano pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter as part of a plea deal and, on Monday, a judge sentenced him to 10 years in prison -- much to the dismay of the victim's mother, Kathleen Tapia. 'You took a deal: 10 years. For me, that's not long enough,' Tapia said at the sentencing. 'I don't forgive you, and I never will.' Sentence: A judge has sentenced Tony Lopez Lozano (photographed), of Oregon City, to 10 years in prison for fatally stabbing his boyfriend, Brian Romo . Lozano claimed that he was 'very intoxicated' when he killed Romo and, KTVZ reports, the fight came after a night of drinking at their home in the city's South End neighborhood. A prosecutor said that Lozano 'has pretty consistently taken responsibility for [the murder].' However, had the case gone to trial, Lozano would have claimed that Romo was physically abusive, according to the Oregonian. Victim: Brian Romo (pictured), was fatally stabbed in the heart by his boyfriend Romo  following an argument at their Oregon City home . Drinking: Lozano held that he was 'very intoxicated' when he killed Romo and the fight came after a night of drinking at their home in the city's South End neighborhood . Romo's relatives said Lozano was prone to acts of violence claiming that the 35-year-old threatened to kill Romo and had stabbed him once before. Lozano apologized to the victim's family during the sentencing but told Tapia that she was abusive and he was glad he'd never see her again.","A judge sentenced Tony Lopez Lozano, 35, to 10 years in prison for stabbing his boyfriend in the heart during a  fight .

"Virgin Galactic hopes to begin testing a new version of SpaceShipTwo by the end of the year, according to the company’s chief executive. Its previous plane was destroyed in a crash in the Mojave Desert in October 2014. The company said it is planning to use lessons learned from the crash to ensure that the new spacecraft works ‘better’. Scroll down for video . Chief executive George Whitesides has said the new spacecraft (shown in construction) is nearly ready. He said it could begin test flights by the end of this year. Its predecessor was destroyed in the Mojave Desert on 31 October 2014. Co-pilot Michael Alsbury was killed and pilot Peter Siebold was injured . The comments were made by chief executive George Whitesides at the annual Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, reported the Financial Times. ‘The first message that I wanted to communicate is that we are moving forward well,’ Mr Whitesides told the audience. ‘The team is doing great and has turned a corner - that is the second spaceship.’ Ticket cost: The starting price for flights is £150,000 ($250,000). The first will be by Richard Branson and his family. Training: Passengers are required to go through a 'Pre-Flight Experience Programme', including three days of pre-flight preparing onsite at the spaceport to ensure passengers are physically and mentally fit to fly. Once aboard: SpaceShipTwo will carry six passengers and two pilots. Each passenger gets the same seating position with two large windows - one to the side and one overhead. Flight path: A climb to 50,000ft (15,000 metres) before the rocket engine ignites and SpaceShipTwo separates from its carrier aircraft, White Knight II. Passengers become 'astronauts' when they reach the Karman line 62 miles (100km) up. Virgin Galactic has not named this vehicle yet. The first was called SW12 8QYVSS Enterprise. Construction on the spacecraft began in 2012, as Virgin Galactic always planned to have more than one craft. 'Assembly of SpaceShipTwo Serial 2  is now 75 per cent complete, and we are on track to start the vehicle’s test program this year,' a spokesperson from the company told MailOnline. 'This programme includes both ground and flight tests, the exact timing of which will be dictated by safety and readiness rather than deadlines.' The previous SpaceShipTwo was destroyed on 31 October 2014 when co-pilot Michael Alsbury accidentally pulled a lever that activated the craft’s ‘feathering system’. This is used to help the vehicle slow down and return from space - but deploying it at the wrong moment caused the spacecraft to disintegrate. Alsbury was killed in the resultant crash, while pilot Peter Siebold was seriously injured - but somehow survived when he was thrown clear of the cockpit in his seat. While the fault appears to have been down to human error - and not a mechanical fault - the National Transportation Safety Board is yet to publish its report on the crash. The first SpaceShipTwo spacecraft, VSS Enterprise (pictured), was destroyed when co-pilot Michael Alsbury accidentally pulled a level that activated the craft’s ‘feathering system’ at high speeds. Deploying it at the wrong moment caused the spacecraft to disintegrate . ‘The team is doing great and has turned a corner - that is the second spaceship,' said chief executive George Whitesides, left. Richard Branson, right, has previously spoken of his desire to push forward . While the crash of VSS Enterprise (shown) appears to have been down to human error - and not mechanical - the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is yet to publish its report . Debris was scattered across the Mojave Desert following the crash. Although Alsbury was killed, Siebold was able to somehow survive when his seat was thrown clear of the disintegrating cockpit . One issue is that spacecraft are normally required to be capable of handling two errors. But in this case only one - the pulling of the lever - was enough to cause a catastrophic failure. Mr Whitesides was confident, though, that the company could overcome the disaster. ‘I think, ultimately, we will have a better spaceship for it,’ he said, adding that they still had ‘roughly 700 [customers] who are eager to fly.’ Celebrities among the 700 who have tickets include Ashton Kutcher (left) and Leonardo DiCaprio (right) While SpaceShipTwo was destroyed, the White Knight II plane carrying it - shown - remained intact, and will likely be used again for the successor .","Chief executive George Whitesides says new spacecraft is nearly ready .

"Unleashing your inner Shakespeare could be just a few jolts of electricity away. Researchers in North Carolina claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent. They tested their theory using a 10-Hertz current on the brain's of 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain's natural alpha wave oscillations. Researchers in North Carolina claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent . As well as creativity, these oscillations - or the lack of them - are linked with depression. Flavio Frohlich, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina said: 'If we could enhance these brain activity patterns, then we could potentially help many people.' Alpha oscillations occur within the frequency range of eight and 12 Hertz 9 (or cycles per second). They were discovered in 1929 by Hans Berger, who invented EEG. Alpha oscillations happen most prominently when we close our eyes and shut out sensory stimuli – things we see, feel, taste, smell, and hear. When alpha oscillations are active, your sensory inputs might be offline as you daydream, meditate, or conjure ideas. When you come fully online, alpha oscillations disappear. Other oscillations at higher frequencies, such as gamma oscillations, take over. An EEG of a naturally occurring alpha oscillation in a human brain. Enhancing these electric oscillations may help treat people with depression, scientists claim . They tested their theory using a 10-Hertz current run through electrodes attached to the scalp on 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain's natural alpha wave oscillations. They then recorded the results using EEG . Knowing this, other researchers began associating alpha oscillations with creativity. Professor Frohlich set out to find evidence. His idea was simple. If he could enhance the rhythmic patterns of alpha oscillations to improve creativity. For the study, Professor Frohlich's team enrolled 20 healthy adults. Researchers placed electrodes on each side of each participant's frontal scalp and a third electrode toward the back of the scalp. An experimental technique used to boost brain performance with electrical pulses can actually cause people to perform less well in some tasks, scientists have found. The technology, known as transcranial direct current stimulation, is already being marketed in commercial products as a way of helping computer game players and athletes improve their focus. However, new research from the University of Oxford suggests that the benefits of this technique, which stimulates activity in the brain with an electrical current, may be limited by personality as it appears to only be helpful to people who are stressed about performing a task. They found that while electrical stimulation helped those who lacked confidence or were anxious about performing a series of sums, it caused those who did not fear mathematics to decline. A follow up study that examined how volunteers fared at spotting which way an arrow was pointing on a screen when confronted with distracting information showed that all those who received stimulation performed more poorly. This way, the 10-Hertz alpha oscillation stimulation for each side of the cortex would be in unison. Each participant underwent two sessions. During one session, researchers used a 10-Hertz sham stimulation for just five minutes. Participants felt a tingle at the start of the five minutes. For the next 25 minutes, each participant continued to take the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking. In one task, each participant was shown a small fraction of an illustration – sometimes just a bent line on a piece of paper. Participants used the line to complete an illustration, and they wrote a title when they finished. In the other session each participant underwent the same protocol, except they were stimulated at 10 Hertz for the entire 30 minutes while doing the Torrance test. The tingling sensation only occurred at the start of the stimulation, ensuring that each participant did not know which session was the control session. Then Frohlich's team compared each participant's creativity score, they found participants scored an average 7.4 percentage points higher than they did during the control sessions. 'That's a pretty big difference when it comes to creativity,' Frohlich said. 'Several participants showed incredible improvements in creativity. It was a very clear effect.' 'We don't know if there are long-term safety concerns,' he said. 'We did a well-controlled, one-time study and found an acute effect.' 'Also, I have strong ethical concerns about cognitive enhancement for healthy adults, just as sports fans might have concerns about athletic enhancement through the use of performance-enhancing drugs.'","Researchers ran a 10-Hertz current through brains of 20 volunteers .

"Police have returned to the home of Bill Spedding for the third time this year - a person of interest in the case of missing toddler William Tyrrell. It has emerged that detectives spent just over an hour at the  repairman's house in Bonny Hills on the NSW north coast on Monday afternoon, the Daily Telegraph reports. The 63-year-old's home had been searched earlier in the year, in January and March, after it was unveiled that he was due to fix William's grandmother's washing machine around the time the boy vanished. The recent visit by investigators comes as police revealed that they believe William may be alive, despite fears that he was abducted by a paedophile ring operating on the mid-north coast of NSW. The three-year-old was last seen dressed in a Spider-Man suit and playing in his grandmother's yard in broad daylight in a quiet street in Kendall last September. Scroll down for video . William Tyrrell was last seen dressed in a Spider-Man suit and playing in his grandmother's yard in broad daylight in a quiet street in Kendall last September . Police have returned to the home of Bill Spedding for the third time this year - a person of interest in the case of the missing toddler . Detective Inspector Gary Jubelin along with his colleague were seen leaving Mr Spedding's home through his garage yesterday afternoon. The Daily Telegraph reports the detectives arrived at the premise at about 4pm and spoke with the repairman. Although Mr Spedding was previously identified as a person of interest in the case, he says he didn't go to house where the toddler was last seen on September 12 as he couldn't get in contact with William's grandmother. Police searched the 63-year-old's home in March and businesses in nearby Laurieton in January, seizing various items, including cars, a mattress and computer, for forensic examination. Mr Spedding has strongly denied any involvement and police have previously stressed he isn't their only line of inquiry. Investigators believe the boy was snatched during a very short window of time when he was out of sight of his family as he played outside . It has emerged that detectives spent just over an hour at the repairman's house in Bonny Hills on the NSW north coast on Monday afternoon . The 63-year-old's home had been searched earlier in the year, in January and March, after it was unveiled that he was due to fix William's grandmother's washing machine around the time the boy vanished . Just a day after William's parents made an impassioned plea for the three-year-old to be returned to them, police have described the 'fast-paced' investigation into the new line of inquiry. 'The two worlds collided. We have information that could link William's disappearance to a group of people suspected of paedophile activity,' said lead investigator Detective Inspector Gary Jubelin. The focus of the investigation has shifted dramatically, and is now 'progressing rapidly', according to Homicide Squad commander Detective Superintendent Mick Willing, reported news.com.au. 'We are pursuing many, many lines of inquiry but what I can say is that there is a team of detectives working very hard. This is a very fast-paced moving inquiry,' Detective Superintendent Willing said. The Detective Sup took a firm stance on the consequences for anyone found to be involved with the toddler's disappearance. 'If you know anything you are implicated. If you are involved you will be charged,' he said. Det Sup Willing also spoke of the heartache William's parents had experienced since his abduction, and said that the family needed answers to where their beloved little boy was. This comes as the three-year-old's mother spoke out about the horrifying moment she realised her son had vanished. One of the new photos released by police of William Tyrrell show the three-year-old smiling and playing guitar, while other images and photos show an energetic and happy youngster full of life . Little William's mother frantically searched the house, opening cupboards and yelling out, 'You need to talk to mummy and tell me where you are' in the moments after she found she couldn't hear her son. 'When I realised that William was missing – I think back to that moment where I just went, 'I can't hear him, why, why can't I hear him',' she said. William was last seen in September last year at the front yard of his grandmother's house in Kendall, on the NSW mid-north coast. 'I just walked out and just I see nothing, I hear nothing, I'm speechless. I'm walking around in a circle on the spot thinking where is he? Why can't I see him? And I'm yelling out, 'William, where are you'?' his mother told The Sydney Morning Herald. The toddlers parents released a heart-wrenching video earlier on Friday begging for his return. 'Just give him back ... take him to a church, take him to a police station, take him to school. Give him to someone, give him back,' his mother says in a video released by police. William's father choked back tears as he remembered his son, who was infatuated with the Spider-Man superhero. '(He loved) anything that related to Spider-Man and superheroes,' William's father said in the video. 'He's a cheeky, vibrant little boy... full of energy. I mean he's my little boy.' Heartfelt plea: William Tyrrell's distraught parents released a video pleading for their missing son's return as well as home movies showing the lively boy riding his bike (pictured) and playing at the family home . But he said William was a cautious boy who wouldn't go with a stranger. His mother said she had a vision that somebody 'reached over ... has gone `clump' on his shoulders, picked him up and moved him on ... because ... that's the only way ... to explain for him not to be there.' She said the family was struggling with not knowing where William is or what happened to him. 'We need to know what happened to him ... `cause we can't live forever ... like this.' She said she hoped whoever had him was looking after him. 'I want him to be safe, I want him to be feeling loved and I want someone to be looking after him because to imagine that something else is going on ... we can't live like that.' The distraught couple has also released new pictures and home videos of the boy in the hope that new clues will emerge as to his whereabouts. In the videos, William can be seen riding his bike down a path and flashing a cheeky grin, as well as playing a guitar and swivelling his hips in times to the music. 'Just give him back':  The parents (pictured) issued the plea in an emotional video released by NSW Police to encourage people to come with forward with new leads as to the missing toddler's whereabouts . Full of life: The new videos of William Tyrrell (pictured, above at a slightly younger age) show a smiling boy full of energy and his mother has begged kidnappers to show her son care and love if the little boy is still alive, seven months after police believe he was abducted from his grandmother's NSW mid north coast home . The parents of missing three-year-old William Tyrrell have released new pictures of their son and a video pleading for his return by abductors who are believed to have snatched him in daylight last September . Legal restrictions have prevented William's parents from speaking publicly throughout the ordeal, and their identities are not revealed in the video. The footage comes as detectives reveal that they believe the three-year-old may have been abducted by a paedophile ring. Detective Superintendent Mick Willing, NSW Homicide Squad Commander, said on Friday: 'One of our lines of inquiry relates to people we expect to be involved in a paedophile ring.' He said detectives from the homicide squad and the sex crime squad are 'vigorously perusing that line of inquiry and this investigation is moving at a very fast pace.' 'We are persuing every lead that we get,' Detective Willing said. William was last seen dressed in a Spider-Man suit and playing in his grandmother's yard in broad daylight in a quiet street in Kendall last September. Vigorous pursuit: NSW Homicide squad boss Detective Superintendent Mick Willing (pictured) revealed on Friday that police are investigating William Tyrrell's disappearance at a very fast pace and that 'one of our lines of inquiry relates to people we expect to be involved in a paedophile ring' A new home video of cheeky William Tyrrell (pictured, eating cake) has been provided by the family in their desperate wait for the return of the three-year-old, seven months after his probable kidnap . William Tyrrell's parents released an impassioned plea in which his mother said she had a vision that somebody 'reached over ... and has gone 'clump' on his shoulders' Investigators believe he was snatched during a very short window of time when he was out of sight of his family as he played outside. The parents have urged anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers immediately on 1800 333 000. The release of the video comes more than a month since police scoured bushland in Bonny Hills, south of Port Macquarie, for evidence relating to William's whereabouts. Police divers were brought in from Sydney to search a murky dam in a bush reserve and a nearby swamp, after more than 30 officers and the dog squad had spent spent two days searching through dense bushland - including along a track that can only be accessed by four-wheel drive. The three-day search was carried out near Mr Spedding's home.

"Police are hunting for a 26-year-old man after his mother and sister were found dead at two separate addresses in an alleged double murder in Bootle. The body of Sarah Fox, 27, was found by police on Thursday night, just hours before her 57-year-old mother Bernadette was found dead at sheltered accommodation just half a mile away. Merseyside Police said Mrs Fox died of asphyxiation, while her daughter was repeatedly stabbed. The family of Bernadette (left) and Sarah  family today said they are 'absolutely devastated' at their loss . Bernadette and Sarah's family today said they are 'absolutely devastated' at their loss. Police are now appealing for the public's help to track down Peter Fox. They say they want to speak 'urgently' with him in connection to the deaths. Merseyside Police have issued a photograph of Mr Fox and warned the public not to approach him. Detective Chief Inspector Dave Rooney said: 'We are currently trying to trace Peter Fox, the son of Bernadette, as he could have information which could assist with our investigation. I would appeal to Peter to come forward so that we can speak to him following the murders of his mother and sister. Police are hunting for 26-year-old Peter Fox, the brother and son of the two women who were allegedly murdered this week in Bootle . 'I would also ask the public to help us find Peter as we need to speak to him urgently in relation to the two murders. 'I would stress to the public that if they do see Peter Fox, they should not approach him. We would urge anyone with information about his whereabouts to contact the police on 999.' Fox is described as white, between 5ft 2in and 5ft 5in and of slight build with short, dark hair - no longer shaved - and brown eyes. He speaks with a Liverpool accent. Both properties remained sealed off while forensic investigators carry out searches. Detectives are also looking for CCTV footage. Mr Rooney added: 'The investigation into these deaths is at an early stage and, although the motive is unclear at this time, we believe the offender may be known to the victims. 'I would like to reassure residents who live in the Bootle area where these addresses are located that we have increased patrols in the area to provide reassurance and support.' In a statement issued through police, a spokesman for the Fox family said: 'We are absolutely devastated following the loss of Bernadette and Sarah and are still trying to come to terms with what has happened to them both. 'Bernadette, who was a mother of three and grandmother of three, was a very outgoing and lovely person who wouldn't harm anyone. In fact she only ever had nice things to say about people. She was so caring and would help anyone. Police launched a double murder inquiry after the bodies of two women were found at separate addresses in Bootle, Merseyside. Pictured, officers outside a property in Worcester Road . Sarah Fox, 27, was found dead with multiple injuries at around 9pm on Thursday evening, after police were called to Worcester Road (pictured) over concerns for her welfare . 'And Sarah was loved by her family and well-liked by her friends and neighbours. She was a fantastic aunty and was a cheeky, bubbly and outgoing person who loved her dog. They will both be greatly missed. 'We would ask that people appreciate that this is a sad and tragic time for the family and that we are left alone to grieve in peace, whilst we try to understand what has happened.' The family urged anyone with information about the incident to contact police to help them 'find justice for Bernadette and Sarah'. Sarah Fox's body was found around 9pm on Thursday night after police received a phone call about her welfare. A neighbour had reportedly raised the alarm after seeing a dog loose on the streets. Police stand outside the flat in Worcester Road where a double murder inquiry has been launched yesterday . Another neighbour living close to the flat, who did not want to be named, said: 'I saw one of my neighbours in the street who said he was worried after he noticed the dog from the flat roaming the streets, he had seen it a few times so he knocked on the door but got no answer. 'He called to the house last night and noticed there was a downstairs window open and the back door was ajar.' It was then that the police were called and officers found Sarah Fox's body, who they said had suffered 'multiple injuries'. 'It's so shocking. I've spoken to the girl from those flats before two or three times, she seemed a nice girl,' the neighbour added. Bernadette Fox was found when police arrived at her address through other enquiries. A police van parked up outside Roger Arden Court in Bootle, where Sarah Fox's mother Bernadette, 57, was found dead on Friday morning . Detectives and forensic officers are investigating the killings. Police believe the alleged murderer was known to both women . One neighbour near the sheltered housing property, who did wish to be named, said: 'The girl's name was Sarah - people called her Foxy - and her mum was Bernie. 'Bernie was harmless and Sarah I think had worked at a solicitors nearby, Bernie had a son as well. 'The place where Bernie lived was sheltered accommodation and it had cameras all over the place. 'There's a camera over the intercom so anyone letting someone in would see them. It's a hard place to get into.' Martin Stevenson, Director of Older People's Services at Your Housing Group, said yesterday: 'Tragically a body was discovered at one of our Roger Arden Court sheltered scheme apartments in Bootle this morning. 'Merseyside Police attended the incident and we are continuing to support them with their investigations.

'I've been a cop for 20 years... and this is the first case where I've had this many aliases,' LAPD's Detective Danny Gore told the LA Times. He predicted Parker would have continued to operate under the various identities for the rest of her life. 'It's like a way of life. I don't know that there was an end,' he remarked. 'You have to be dedicated.' Efforts to find a phone number for Parker were unsuccessful. It wasn't immediately known if she has an attorney. As of Friday, Parker was in federal custody in Northern California, where she was wanted for probation violations. She was convicted in 2000 for federal mail fraud in Hawaii after she used the Jenny Craig Corp's corporate travel account to purchase plane tickets and then sold the tickets privately for $500 apiece. Parker has repeatedly violated the terms of her release since then and was wanted by the U.S. Marshals, according to records. According to police, she also paid utilities under false names and acquired credit cards with other people's financial information. After she serves time in Northern California, she'll be sent down to Los Angeles County to answer for the alleged identity thefts, Deputy U.S. Marshal Laura Vega said. Until that time, investigators are looking for more victims. Though the current victims only date back to 2012, Gore said he believes there could be incidents going back to 2010.

"We are well versed in the dangers of using sunbeds, with skin cancer preying on the minds of all who expose their skin to the UV rays. But experts have warned the disease is not the only health danger associated with the pursuit of an artificial year-round tan. Those compelled by a desire for bronzed skin are also at risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection - herpes. Dermatologist Dawn Marie Davies, from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, warns sunbed users could be putting themselves at risk of contracting the sexually transmitted infection, herpes . Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex. Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes. There is no complete cure for the infection - rather, a sufferer will be given treatment each time they suffer a flare up. Dermatologist Dawn Marie Davies, an associate professor of dermatology at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, warns the virus, and other bacteria, can survive on tanning beds, despite the heat. 'In my practice, I've seen acquired bacterial infections, warts, and herpes infections from tanning beds,' she told Yahoo. She said staphylococcus bacteria, which can cause skin infections, faecal bacteria, the herpes virus and the wart-causing human papillomavirus are all able to withstand the heat of a sunbed to survive. Bacteria that lies on a person's skin can easily be transferred to the bed, when a person is lying down. The heat - not high enough to kill the infection - allows the bacteria to develop to become stronger and more able to survive. When a person sweats, it provides a breeding ground for bacteria or viruses. It is then possible for the infection to transfer to another sunbed user, entering the body via a small cut or nick in the skin, often so small a person may be unaware. 'Ultraviolet light can theoretically kill germs, but it's not enough to kill germs on the tanning bed,' Professor Davies warned. 'What's interesting is that when you use the ultraviolet light over and over again - and the tanning bed lights are on for multiple hours a day - if the bacteria or virus is exposed to some antiseptic but not enough to kill it, or some light but not enough to kill it, it can grow stronger and then it becomes resistant.' Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex. Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes. A recurrence of the virus is often triggered by being unwell, stress, drinking excess alcohol, exposure to ultraviolet light, for example, using sunbeds, and having a weakened immune system. Herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. Professor Davies warns that the virus can remain on tanning beds, infecting other sunbed users . Symptoms of genital herpes include: . These symptoms may last up to 20 days, but the sores will eventually scab and heal without scarring. Although the initial symptoms of genital herpes clear up, the virus remains dormant. It can be reactivated, causing recurrences, which are usually shorter and less severe.","Skin cancer is not the only health danger lurking for sunbed users .

"A dramatic road rage incident between a truck driver and two young men has been caught on camera. The footage, which was taken last Monday in Forrestville in northern Sydney shows a  driver behind the wheel of an AC & S truck tailgating, yelling and flashing his lights aggressively, nearly crashing into the back of a small Subaru car.

A dramatic road rage incident between a truck driver and two young men has been caught on camera . Friends Cameron Rose and Bo Honna were the occupants of the Subaru and said they were perturbed when the truck driver crossed into their lane without using any indication. While Mr Honna was driving the car, his mate Mr Rose was filming the menacing incident on his phone. After Mr Rose put his arm out the window in a gesture to show the truck driver that he was not happy with his action, an onslaught of terror began. First the truck driver drove up right behind the men, almost touching their bumper. Then he began laughing and sticking his head out the window, shouting abuse at the men, beeping his horn and flashing his lights to put them off their driving. According to Mr Honna, the truckie got about two centimetres from the back of his car. The incident, which started on Warringah Road apparently continued for 8.5km until both the car and the truck were forced to stop at a red light.

In the Meeks' parody video, Melissa raps, 'When our family and friends, who were up to no good, started asking questions about parenthood. 'We told one little lie, said ""It's not time yet."" Parents said ""We're ready for grandkids, get a move on it!""' Jesse raps that the couple thought it would take longer than the two months the pair spent trying to conceive. Melissa says in the video 'I woke up in the morning about 7 or 8 and I thought to myself, ""Oh man, I'm late!"" Looked at the test and it was finally there. The little plus sign. We're now three. Not a pair.' At the end of the video, the Meeks smile and share a sonogram of their unborn child.

"Terrifying footage has emerged of young thugs who got out of their vehicle to threaten another driver while one was armed with a weapon at a set of traffic lights. The dashboard camera has captured the unnamed driver travelling along a Melbourne road when a red ute with P-plates quickly cuts into the lane to turn right at an intersection. Moments later, the red ute appears to look frustrated at the slow moving traffic as they attempt to overtake by carelessly swerving onto the wrong side of the road, A Current Affair reports. Scroll down for video . This woman pulled out a dagger and stabbed the car's bonnet before she made her way back to the red ute . As the driver in front passes through another intersection, the ute seemed to have slowed down until they dashed passed an amber light before ramming the innocent driver. When the red ute pulled in front of the vehicle at a red light, three young people got out to confront the threatened driver. The ute driver is seen wandering off the screen while a young woman, donning a black hooded jacket, pulls the middle finger at the driver as she walks closer to the vehicle. Within seconds, she pulls a dagger out of her side and stabs the bonnet of the car before the three are seen walking back to their ute.

"Sue Sim came to national prominence five years ago when she led the Northumbria Police manhunt for killer Raoul Moat . A chief constable facing a bullying probe for her alleged Alex Ferguson-style 'hair dryer treatment' of colleagues is to retire with full pension after 30 years of service. Sue Sim, who came to national prominence five years ago as Northumbria Police dealt with the Raoul Moat manhunt, said she was 'sad' to leave the force but was retiring to spend more time with her family. It was announced last month that Ms Sim was to be investigated by her Police and Crime Commissioner's office for alleged misconduct. Although she was not suspended after the accusations were made against her, it was reported those below her were walking on 'eggshells' such was the manner in which she delivered her assessments. Her style has been compared to her predecessor Sir John Stevens, who delivered what have been described as legendary 'b**********' to the officers under his command. A Northumbria Police spokesman today confirmed she will retire with full pension despite being the subject of an investigation. Ms Sim said: 'After careful consideration I have decided to retire when I reach my 30 years service on June 3. 'My family have made many sacrifices to enable me to have such a fantastic career and it is now time to spend more time with them. 'I am obviously sad to leave but it is the right time and I am confident I have left a legacy of high performance that will continue. 'I have been extremely fortunate to have had a marvellous career and I am as committed to serving the public as I was when I first joined Merseyside Police in 1985.' Chief Constable Sim came to public prominence during the hunt for crazed killer Raoul Moat in 2010 when she held her position in a temporary capacity. She described the search for Moat following the murder of Christopher Brown and shooting of one of her own officers, PC David Rathband, as 'one of the most challenging times' of her career. During this time she fronted public appeals to locate the killer and became the face of the police response, during which officers were warned they were targets. She said: 'That was one of the most challenging times of my career and the largest manhunt the country has seen for 44 years. 'I am immensely proud of my officers and staff who went about their roles fully aware of the threats against them, but determined to support the public.' Vera Baird, police and crime commissioner for Northumbria, said she would miss working with Ms Sim. Ms Baird said: 'Chief Constable Sue Sim gave me formal notice of her decision to retire on Wednesday April 8 and she will leave the force on June 3 when she has completed 30 years of public service in policing. 'Sue has brought passion and enthusiasm to her role with Northumbria Police, always remaining focused on cutting crime and ensuring victims of crime are at the heart of everything Northumbria Police does. 'She and I have worked well together over the two-and-a-half years since I became police and crime commissioner. PC David Rathband (left) was left blinded after being attacked by Raoul Moat (right) in July 2010. Chief Constable Sue Sim, who became the police face of the Moat manhunt, has now announced her retirement . 'She responded to the challenge of this new governance structure very positively and my experience of her is that she always, without exception, delivers what she has promised.' Ms Baird said Ms Sim had played a 'key role' in the success of the force. 'I will miss our joint working and I wish her well in her retirement,' she said. Last month, Ms Baird announced that she had appointed a judge to lead an inquiry into allegations that Ms Sim might have 'fallen short of her duty as a police officer to treat colleagues with respect and courtesy'. She said: 'Over the past few days, I have sought clarification about the issues raised by some officers. 'I am now clear that they wish to make complaints against the chief constable of Northumbria Police which merit investigation.' Ms Sim said she would co-operate with the inquiry.","Police chief constable Sue Sim has announced she will retire on June 3 .

"Premier League stars including Steven Gerrard, Theo Walcott and Phil Jones could face an advertising watchdog probe they plugged an Adidas  sale on Twitter. Manchester City's David Silva and Everton's Phil Jagielka were also among around a dozen players sponsored by the firm who urged millions of followers to buy the knock-down goods. This comes amid mounting concern that celebrities and sports stars are cashing in by turning Twitter into an advertising platform. The players posted messages within minutes of each other yesterday, with Arsenal forward Walcott tweeting: 'For 25 hours you can get 25% discount on Adidas.co.uk if you use 'friendsoftheo'.' Premier League stars including Arsenal forward Theo Walcott (pictured) could face an advertising watchdog probe they plugged an Adidas sale on Twitter . Silva tweeted: 'Who is up for 25% savings on @adidas products? Click here to find out more! #friendsofdavid.' Guidance from the Advertising Standards Authority states that when there is payment and control from an advertiser, the sponsored tweet should be obviously identifiable. British celebrities have been advised to include the word 'ad' or 'spon' to show if something is an advert or sponsored. The watchdog has previously banned a Nike campaign featuring tweets from Wayne Rooney, one of its brand ambassadors, because they were not clearly identified as promotional messages. Players including Steven Gerrard (pictured) and Everton's Phil Jagielka were  among around a dozen players sponsored by the firm who urged millions of followers to buy the knock-down goods . It was the first UK company to have a Twitter campaign banned, after the ASA ruled in 2012 that the use of the  personal accounts of footballers broke the rules. The Manchester United striker, who has more than 11 million followers, tweeted: 'My resolution — to start the year as a champion, and finish it as a champion...#makeitcount gonike.me/makeitcount'. A tweet from Jack Wilshere said: 'In 2012, I will come back for my club — and be ready for my country.#makeitcount.gonike.me/Makeitcount'. Both footballers were banned from repeating the messages and Nike was warned about ensuring all Twitter advertising is easily identifiable. England footballer Phil Jones and Manchester City's David Silva posted messages within minutes of each other . But another one of Rooney's tweets was said to have not breached advertising rules because its language was markedly different from the footballer's usual Twitter messages. This tweet said: 'The pitches change. The killer instinct doesn't. Own the turf, anywhere. @NikeFootball #myground.' The Advertising Standards Authority has not yet received any complaints about the promotional tweets for Adidas. But a spokesman said: 'If we receive complaints that tweets have broken rules, we will investigate. 'Marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such. 'If any social media account (including celebrity twitter accounts) are tweeting ads and it's not clear from the context that these are marketing communications then they need to be labelled as an ad.' Some fans saw straight through the players' Adidas tweets, with GX Blue ‏tweeting: 'I bet you David Silva didn't write that tweet himself!!' A spokesman for Adidas said: 'To our knowledge, there have not been any complaints about the tweets and we have not been contacted by the ASA with regards to this matter.

"The Muslim man who was racially abused along with his wife has thanked the 'legend' woman who stood up for them and recorded the attack. Stacey Eden, 23, stood up for the Muslim woman and her partner after witnessing the ranter 'bullying' the Sydney commuter on an Airport Line train about 1.40pm on Wednesday. Ms Eden switched on the video camera on her mobile phone to record the vile rant before rushing to Muslim couple's defence with a fiery spray notably absent of any swearing. Scroll down for video . Not going to take it anymore: Stacey Eden (pictured) made a bold stand in defence of a Muslim couple who faced a racially-charged tirade on a Sydney train on Wednesday afternoon . Hafeez Ahmed Bhatti told Daily Mail Australia he was shocked by the ugly incident. 'She asked my wife why she was wearing a scarf when it was hot outside - when my wife answered her I thought the woman was asking to be friendly,' Mr Bhatti said. 'Then she started saying Muslims like us are trying to conquer Australia and behead everyone here. We were absolutely shocked. 'It was just very disappointing.' Mr Bhatti said another woman nearby supported the racist woman, and the incident caused his family to miss its flight home. 'She said all Muslims should be kicked out of Australia - I tried to calm things down by telling her we love everyone,' Mr Bhatti said. He also said his wife was 'very shaken up' after the incident, to the extent she questioned if it was worth staying in Australia. 'This sort of thing has happened before, but you try to ignore it and the ignorant people behind it; there are lots of very good people in Australian and only a few bad ones,' he said. 'God bless Stacey Eden who supported us.' Hafeez Bhatti, who was racially abused along with his wife on a Sydney train, thanked the woman who stood up for them . 'Stacey thanks again for your support for us on that day...I generally believe that you and many other Australian do respect all religions,' Mr Bhatti posted . Police are urging anyone who witnessed the attack, which was caught on camera, to come forward . 'Stacey thanks again for your support for us on that day...I generally believe that you and many other Australian do respect all religions,' Mr Bhatti said on his Facebook account . Mr Bhatti reached out to Ms Eden on his Facebook page after the story emerged. 'Stacey thanks again for your support for us on that day...I generally believe that you and many other Australian do respect all religions,' Mr Bhatti posted. On Wednesday afternoon, Mr Bhatti vented his frustrations with the attack, when he posted: 'once again, victim of racism by an old Christian lady.' He also discussed the events and said it started after the woman touched his wife's head like she was blessing her, before 'she started her ignorant comments'. Mr Bhatti also said his community, near Brisbane, had invited Ms Eden to visit them one day. 'They all want to thank her for what she did to help us,' he said. He also confirmed he will speak with police on Friday regarding the incident. Rant: Video shows this woman launching into a fiery spray about Islam, bringing up beheadings and the marriage of children while berating a Muslim woman for wearing a black headscarf . Ms Eden, who recorded a snippet of the conversation, fired back at the woman in defence of the Muslim couple (above): 'Have some respect... What's that got to do with this poor lady?' A police spokeswoman contacted Daily Mail Australia on Thursday to say they would 'definitely encourage' witnesses of the middle-aged woman's offensive public transport tirade to come forward. In her recording of the incident, Ms Eden is heard fuming:  'She wears it (her hijab) for herself, OK!' 'She wears it because she wants to be modest with her body, not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her.' Ms Eden said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded 'all Muslims ISIS supporters' and insulted the woman's husband and headscarf. Ms Eden was not having a bar of it. 'That is not her doing it. That is a minority of people. Not a majority of people OK? 'It doesn't matter what they're doing... Have some respect, have some respect,' she said, as the woman continued on her tirade. 'It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. What's that got to do with this poor lady? What's that got to do with her?' 'She was saying some pretty horrible and hurtful things before I spoke up then as soon I started defending them she stopped' The Muslim couple told Stacey Eden (left, right) that they were 'very grateful' for her stand . 'Nothing,' the ranter replied. 'Exactly!' Ms Eden fired back. 'You're the one who started the argument!' the woman said. Ms Eden then instructed the woman to be silent. 'No, you're the one sitting there saying things under your breath, shut your mouth, simple. 'You shut your mouth,' the woman replied. 'No, you shut your mouth. You've got nothing nice to say, don't say anything, simple.' Ms Eden recorded a short snippet of the incident - not the whole alleged tirade - on her phone, ending with the passenger telling her to 'breathe'. She told Daily Mail Australia the Muslim couple and the angry woman alighted the train at Sydney International Airport. Ms Eden told Daily Mail Australia the couple alighted the train at Sydney International Airport . 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot . 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot. Ms Eden said the woman was saying 'horrible and hurtful things'. 'She told me if I was in their country I would have been stoned to death because I was wearing a dress. 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot . 'She was saying a lot of things I just got to the point where I had heard enough.' The Muslim couple were 'very grateful' for her stand, she said. Police and Sydney Trains have not yet received any reports of the incident. The Islamophobia Register Australia group issued a statement praising Ms Eden's actions shortly after Daily Mail Australia's report. 'We are heartened by Stacey's actions - she is a reflection of 'Team Humanity' and we hope that her actions inspire others to stand up against racial or religious vilification,' it said. The group said they were disappointed by the remarks of the woman in the video. 'The sentiments expressed by the woman however sadly form part of the broader false and deeply damaging narrative whereby the criminal actions of groups like Daesh [Islamic State] are extrapolated to all 1.5+ billion Muslims'. The group's founder, Mariam Veiszadeh, told Daily Mail Australia incidents of abuse against Muslim women were becoming increasingly common. ''I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness),' she said. A hijab-wearing woman told the ABC last month she was subject to a physical and verbal assault on a Sydney train, with a man allegedly shoulder-charging her and hitting her with his bag and leg. Mariam Veiszadeh (pictured), a lawyer and public advocate for the rights of Muslims, says incidents such as these are increasingly common . 'I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness)' Mariam has been the target of racist attacks herself . 'It was a fully crowded train but nobody said anything. People were just listening. I know they were scared,' Hina said. As for Ms Eden, she told Daily Mail Australia she was already overwhelmed by positive comments she had received online, having posted the video just yesterday.

"Forget sober black and charcoal grey. Pink is the new colour of choice for high-achieving women in the world of politics and showbusiness and the style is now spreading to the high street. Those championing pink include Christine Lagarde, the first female chief executive of the International Monetary Fund, and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood, who chose a bright shade of the colour  for her live election debate last Thursday. The pair are among a host of powerful women reaching for different shades of pink, according to The Sunday Times newspaper. Scroll down for video . Christine Lagarde, the first female chief executive of the International Monetary Fund, left, in a pink Chanel suit and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood, right, chose hot pink for her live election debate last Thursday . The sudden rise in use among powerful women is said to be down to the way that the colour is perceived - it used to be a girly but is now considered an appropriate shade to wear to a business meeting. In an interview with the newspaper the managing director of image consultants Colour Me Beautiful, Veronique Henderson, said: 'Pink was for a long time viewed as a girlie colour. It was seen as romantic, not serious in business, but that has changed.' Style icon Samantha Cameron is also a big fan of the colour - she chose a pale dusty pink silk top on the campaign trail for the local and European elections last May. Meanwhile, on daytime television both Lorraine Kelly and Ruth Langsford can regularly be seen in pink dresses while presenting their ITV TV shows.

The high street is responding to the demand for pink with Topshop, Next, H&M and Marks & Spencer all featuring pink in their spring and summer collections. Belinda Earl, M&S creative director told the Sunday Times: 'Pink can create a powerful daytime to evening look and can be styled in multiple ways to remain feminine without being overly girlie.'","Holly Willoughby, Katherine Jenkins and Samantha Cameron all wear pink .

"Kim Kardashian has revealed that she is going to great lengths to make sure that her luxurious designer wardrobe stays in mint condition because she plans on handing ‘everything’ down to her 22-month-old daughter North West. The 34-year-old reality star explained that she is creating an 'archive' of her most infamous outfits, which she stores in clear plastic bags, because she is keen on the idea of North inheriting her wardrobe when she gets older. '[‘I’m saving] every last piece,’ Kim told The Huffington Post of her most memorable designer ensembles. ‘Everything. I have a full archive. The dress that I wore on the cover of Vogue will be hers. All of my Met Gala dresses.' Scroll down for video . Family values: Kim, who is pictured with her smiling daughter North West, revealed that the 22-month-old will inherit her entire wardrobe when she gets older . Mini-me: Kim Kardashian and her 22-month-old daughter North West wear matching back while sightseeing in Armenia . The mother-of-one added: 'I keep everything and put it in these clear plastic bags altogether with the shoes - the whole look of what I wore.' As Kim named her Givenchy wedding dress, which she wore last May to wed Kanye West in Florence, Italy, as the 'prize piece' in her clothing collection, it’s likely that the one-of-a-kind gown will also be handed down to her young daughter one day. Kim credited her husband for 'introducing' her to the fashion world and added that she wants their daughter to follow in their footsteps and be confident in what she wears. She added: 'I took a lot of direction from my husband when he introduced me more to the fashion world. And now I love taking risks. I love wearing things that maybe I couldn’t quite understand at the time.' And Kim maintained that she loves all forms of personal style as long as it's unique to the individual. 'I just love when someone has their own style - even if it’s something that I wouldn’t wear,' she said. 'So I would just encourage North to be herself and wear what she thinks she looks good in. Just be yourself and take risks.' Hot mommy: The 34-year-old, pictured in a figure-hugging nude skirt, said she thinks she dresses sexier now that is a mother . Kim also admitted that she is usually responsible for dressing North, she said the 37-year-old rapper always finds something 'super cute' for their little girl to wear. 'I love when he picks out her clothes,' she explained. 'I know if I go downstairs to make breakfast and ask him to get her dressed that she’ll come down looking super cute. But usually I pretty much pick out her outfits.' And with a mother as glamorous and as make-up savvy as Kim, it's no surprise that North is already developing an obsession with beauty products - and shoes. Last week, The Keeping Up with the Kardashian star spoke with Elle.com about her daughter's budding independence and style preferences while sharing her approach to being a businesswoman, mother, wife and dressing her post-baby body. '[North] is obsessed with make-up and watching me get ready and getting ready herself,' Kim told the website. 'She just loves the process. She could not be more ultimately girly-girl.' Family time: Kim can be seen holding North's hand while she and Kanye tour Armenia . Stellar style: North wore a black fringed dress, black combat boots and an olive green jacket while out with her parents . The mother-of-one noted that after she gives North, who will turn two in June, a bath her adorable daughter always asks for her 'purse' because she really wants to grab her mom's make-up bag, which is inside. Kim said that if she turns around for a second, North will have her lipstick 'all over her face', so she had to give her a 'little make-up bag' of her own. Not surprisingly, the reality TV star, who often matches North's outfits to her own, admitted that she likes it when kid's wear 'mini-me styles' and she loves 'seeing kids in black'. While Kim insisted that North 'gravitates towards really simple things' when it comes to clothing, she noted that her little girl 'loves accessories'. According to Kim, the toddler always requests a pair of shoes to wear first thing in the morning. She added that North 'just discovered backpacks so she loves to put them on'. In fact, North loves luggage in general. The precious tot, who has been photographed lugging a small Frozen-themed suitcase through the airport, always tries to take her mom's luggage. Holiday spirit: North donned a flower and a white ensemble that matched her mother's dress when the Kardashian family went to church on Easter . Matching looks: Kim and North donned neutral coats during a trip to the airport . 'We got the Frozen suitcase so she has to carry it everywhere,' she explained. 'It took us about 30 minutes longer to get through the airport because she had to carry her suitcase herself.’ She noted that North didn't want to be picked up, adding: 'She's very independent . Kim believes that her daughter's independence may have to do with the fact she was adamant about North sleeping in her own room - and now that's where she prefers to be. 'She kind of likes to be in her own room and that has allowed [Kanye and I] to have our time together,' she said. Kim said that she doesn't want to tell anyone how to parent, but it was important to her as a new mom that she set boundaries and dedicate five to ten percent of her day to herself in order to maintain her sanity. In sync: North, who loves accessories, was photographed wearing a YSL bag to the airport and striped pants that matched her mom's button-down shirt . 'It worked for me to be able to get my work out in, make me feel good about myself, put my daughter down to bed at a decent time, and have the night with my husband,' she said. And because those post-baby workouts helped her get back in shape, she has a newfound confidence that has inspired her to flaunt her body in cleavage-baring tops and figure-hugging dresses. '[I think I dress] sexier now than I did before,' she said of her mommy style. Kim, who helped her sisters Kourtney and Khloe launch their latest Kardashian Kids children's collection at Nordstrom.com on Monday, noted that she always gives 100per cent of herself to every project she takes on. 'Nothing comes easy,' she said. 'I know that people joke all the time and try to figure out, you know, what it is that I do, but I work really hard. I get up every day at 5 a.m. and start my day.'","The 34-year-old revealed that she keeps 'everything' she wears and stores the items in 'clear plastic bags'

"The couple that models designer clothes together stays together — or at least that's what one New York-based duo hope, having just inked a deal as the first openly gay couple with Fusion Models. John Tuite, 22, and Carlos Santolalla, 25, go by the Brangelina-like portmanteau Jarlos, and have already earned a following in the modeling world and on New York City's party scene. But while the male model It Couple have starred in a campaign together for DKNY and posed for big brands like Edun and DSquared2, they say it hasn't always been easy for them to work in the industry and be true to themselves. Model couple: Carlos Santolalla, 25, left, and John Tuite, 22, right, are the first openly gay couple to be signed together to a modeling agency . Though the fashion industry seems very accepting of gay people, the couple explains that models are still expected to appear masculine or androgynous. Both John and Carlos had to drop their old agencies after they were told to act straight and delete the Instagram account they share, where they often post loving images of themselves kissing and hugging. 'After coming out, I didn’t want to be weird about it again and act straight at castings,' John told The Cut in December. 'The weird thing about models — something that nobody really realizes — is that they’re all straight,' Carlos recently told Out magazine. Growing fan base: On Instagram, the couple goes by the joint nickname Jarlos, and they have over 22,500 followers . Facing obstacles: John and Carlos were told by their previous modeling agencies to act more 'butch' and delete their joint Instagram account, where they often pose kissing and holding hands . 'There is an unspoken rule of modeling, at least in NYC — even if you get signed as an out model — the first thing any agent tells you to do is to dress butch and talk about girls so no one ""finds out"",' John added. In fact, when the couple first got together over three years after meeting at a casting call, it was because Carlos became interested in John when he realized he might be gay — which he says was unusual. Soon the pair became well-known on the New York City party scene, getting snapped with celebrities like model Gigi Hadid and Paris Hilton, DJing at trendy clubs, and even curating art shows. 'We used to sneak into parties we weren’t invited to at all and try to take pictures of famous people,' John said. 'Now we’re invited and covering it and DJing.' Looking good: The couple explained that though the modeling industry is filled with well-groomed, well-dressed men, most male models are straight . Party hard: Jarlos is well known on the New York party circuit and has been pictured with Gigi Hadid, Paris Hilton, and Harry Styles . The fact that the pair has become so widely known as a couple made them even more appealing to Fusion Models. 'We signed them as a duo because they are both models and they DJ as a duo, under the name Jarlos,' Fusion's Alexandra Phipps told Dazed. 'They’ve made a name for themselves as a team, so we decided to run with it.' As for John and Carlos, they are as excited to be making strides for gay models as they are to have signed this new deal. 'Finally being represented as an openly gay man, let alone a couple, is a huge milestone for the industry, and the whole gay community,' John said. 'We hope that this will send a message to younger generations that it's possible to succeed without compromising who you are.'","John Tuite, 22, and Carlos Santolalla, 25, share an Instagram account that their old agencies pressured them to delete .

"A woman who was sexually abused as a child by her step-father has spoken out for the first time after a confession to her fiancé led to her attacker being jailed. Kim Hill, from Suffolk, has bravely waived her right to anonymity and spoken about how she was abused by Derek Osborne from the age of four. The now 31-year-old revealed she was forced to dress up in her mother's lingerie at the age of eight, and was even made to watch pornographic films. Kim Hill (left) was abused for years by her step-father but never revealed her past until her partner Rob (right) encouraged her to approach the police about her attacker. The couple pictured on their wedding day in 2013 . For years, Kim bottled up the painful memories until she met her husband Rob, 34, who guessed that she had been abused and helped to put Derek behind bars 20 years after the offences. While planning their wedding in 2013, Rob asked his fiancée if she had been abused as a child due to her withdrawn nature. His question finally prompted Kim to confess what happened to her. The mother-of-two says that Rob's question finally gave her the nudge that she needed to reveal her past. 'I'd waited my whole life to hear that question. I was desperate for someone to bring it up, so I could tell them the truth. Derek Osborne (left) abused Kim (right as a child aged seven) from a young age encouraging her to get into his bed for 'cuddles' At the age of nine Derek (pictured) forced Kim (pictured left as a child) to dress up in her mother's lingerie and watch porn films . 'When Rob asked me it was my chance to share the painful secret I'd been hiding – that the man I had called dad had abused me.' She told Rob how her step-father made her climb into bed with him and kiss and cuddle him. He even attacked her two days after her 12th birthday, while taking her out for a celebratory meal. Speaking about the abuse, Kim, who married Rob in 2013, said: 'I didn't know any different so I accepted what he was doing as normal. 'I saw him as my dad. I just thought my dad loved me very much.' Kim's biological father died when she was young and she was aged three when Derek began a relationship with her mother. She says that as a young child Derek's attention was originally welcomed in her large family. 'I scrambled for mum's attention with my three siblings. But I was always Derek's favourite. 'He'd come and tuck me into bed while Mum watched television downstairs.' But the attention soon turned sexual. She said: 'He would kiss me on the lips. Kim never revealed her past until Rob asked her if she had been abused ahead of their wedding . 'He often called me into his bed at night for a cuddle, so he could touch me under the covers. 'I was too young to know how wrong it was. I thought nothing of it. But years went by and the touching became more intimate.' Aged seven, Kim was taught sex education at school which soon made her realise that her step-father's actions were not normal. She said: 'I found out at school how babies are made. 'I was horrified, all I could think was, ""What if I have a baby growing inside me?"" 'I knew how upset mum would be if she found out and I'd get into so much trouble.' Kim was too scared  to approach anybody about her attacker and the abuse continued. She said: 'When I was nine, he forced me to dress up in mum's underwear, then he made me watch sick porn films. 'I didn't know any different so I accepted it as normal.' But that all changed when aged 10, Kim saw a television programme about sexual abuse. She said: 'I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I realised my dad was abusing me. 'Next time he tried to touch me I was in tears and pushed him away. Although he was angry, I stood my ground. Part of me wanted to tell mum, but I didn't want to hurt her.' But weeks later, her mother sat her down with some news that would come as a welcome relief. 'She told me that her and my stepdad were splitting up. Finally, I could escape him.' However to Kim's horror her mother wanted to keep Derek around as a father figure. For her 12th birthday, he took her out for a celebratory dinner. But he pounced when they were alone at his house afterwards and performed a sex act on her. She said: 'My feet were kicking as hard as I could but I wasn't strong enough to push him away. 'A look of anger spread across his face as he tried to hold me down. 'After, I felt disgusting. That was the last time he abused me. Afterwards he moved away with a new partner.' Ahead of the wedding Kim reported the abuse to the police where it was revealed Derek had abused other girls . Although she had finally escaped her attacker Kim was still living with the effects of the abuse. She said: 'I'd become so withdrawn, and jumped whenever anyone brushed past and touched me.' Although Kim met a man aged 18 and had a daughter at 23, the relationship did not work out. She found it difficult to trust and stayed away from the dating scene until a friend set her up with Rob. She says that right from the start Rob offered her huge support and she found him trustworthy. 'I wasn't sure and it was the first proper date I'd had since having my little girl. 'He talked about his sister, who's also a single mum and how difficult she's found it. 'From the very beginning, Rob was so understanding.' Kim and her daughter moved in with Rob after six months and just weeks later in August 2010 he proposed. Kim said she was able to seek justice after confessing all to Rob. Pictured on their wedding day . Kim has began to visit counselling sessions and says she is beginning to move on . The couple had a son in January 2012 and started planning the big day. She said 'Me and Rob shared everything, but I still didn't dare tell him what dad had done. We'd started making plans and wanted the perfect venue.' While searching for wedding venues, Rob asked her if she had been abused as a child. The question came as a huge shock to Kim. She said: 'I broke down in tears. I didn't know how he could guess. 'He said that I was different to other women because I was withdrawn. He encouraged me to tell mum what had happened. 'And with his support the next day I called the police.' After her brave confession Kim discovered that she was not alone and Derek had attacked a string of victims. 'I was the first victim to come forward but soon other victims spoke out and said Derek had abused them too. ' Kim has started her own blog to share her experiences and inspire others . When he was arrested, Derek denied all the offences and even claimed one of the girls had made sexual advances towards him. With the trial looming, in September 2013 Kim and Rob tied the knot. She said: 'I didn't think of Derek once. He might have destroyed my childhood, but he wasn't going to ruin the best day of my life.' In May 2014, Derek, then 72, of Lowestoft, Suffolk, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court where he admitted 16 counts dating from 1982 and 2004, including eight of indecent assault and seven of indecency with a child, related to Kim and two other schoolgirls. He also admitted raping another woman. He was jailed for 21 years. In October 2014 one count of gross indecency with a child, not relating to Kim, was quashed at the Court of Appeal in London, but his sentence remained the same. Kim said: 'I went to see him sentenced. He was so pathetic and frail, he was unrecognisable.' Judge John Holt said Derek's victims had all suffered 'devastating' psychological effects. He said a probation officer who interviewed Derek had assessed him as 'dangerous' and said he had shown 'very little' genuine remorse. Now he is behind bars, Kim says that she has been able to begin to move on. 'I've started counselling and healing sessions with the Happiness Foundation. They're helping me to accept it and move on. 'Rob is there with me every step of the way and I know he's so proud. I've also started a blog about everything I've been through. 'I've had so many victims of sexual abuse thank me for telling my story and showing you can put your abuser behind bars – even years later.'","Kim Hill was abused by her step-father from a young age .

"Welcome to the exoplanet HD 189733b, where temperatures reach 3,000°C (5,400°F) and winds are in excess of 620mph (1,000km/h). This world might be 63 light-years away - and we can’t even get a direct image of it - but scientists have incredibly been able to measure its atmosphere, just by measuring its sodium emission. The findings - made with a relatively small telescope - suggest we may soon have the opportunity to examine other distant worlds beyond the solar system in unprecedented detail. Swiss researchers measured the temperature of 'Hot Jupiter' HD 189733b. They found the temperature reaches up to 3,000°C in the atmosphere (shown in diagram). And wind speeds are in excess of 620 miles per hour. The findings were made using a novel technique relying on sodium signals . The research was carried out by scientists from the Universities of Geneva and Bern in Switzerland. HD 189733b is a gas-giant slightly larger than Jupiter located 370 trillion miles (600 trillion km) from Earth - or 63 light-years. It is located in the constellation Vulpecula in the night sky - also known as the ‘little fox’. The scientists found that the temperature on the planet increases dramatically with altitude – up to 3,000°C (5,400°F) in the upper atmosphere, hot enough to melt lead. Type: 'Hot Jupiter' gas giant . Distance from Earth: 63 light years . Temperature: Up to 3,000°C (5,400°F) Wind speed: 620mph (1,000km/h) Conditions: Glass particles in the atmosphere give it its dazzling blue colour. Coupled with the extremely high wind speed of 620 mph (1,000km/h), it reveals the planet has an extremely turbulent atmosphere - and is almost certainly inhospitable to life. The planet was already known to orbit 13 times closer to its star that Mercury is to our sun, completing an orbit in just 2.2 days. But the results are exciting, because it highlights just how much information we can glean from a distant world with limited technologies. Speaking to MailOnline, subproject leader Dr Kevin Heng said it could be possible to measure the conditions on an Earth-like world using this technique – although the process was difficult. ‘It remains to be seen if the astronomical community is able to do these measurements for Earth analogues,’ he said. The difficulty arises because an Earth-sized world blocks out much less of the light of its parent star compared to a Jupiter-sized world like HD 189733 b . ‘It would help if we can find an Earth-like exoplanet orbiting a really bright star,’ Dr Heng added. And he said the research was important because they used a 'dinky four-metre telescope from the ground to do measurements of the quality as the Hubble Space Telescope.' HD 189733b (right) is a gas-giant slightly larger than Jupiter (left) located 600 trillion kilometres from Earth - or 63 light-years. It is located in the constellation Vulpecula in the night sky - also known as the ‘little fox’ The scientists found that the temperature on the planet (illustrated) increases dramatically with altitude – up to 3,000C in the upper atmosphere, hot enough to melt lead. The technique works by measuring the ‘sodium signal’ from distant worlds. When a planet passes in front of its star, the intensity of this signal varies. Depending on how weak or strong the signal is, it is possible to work out how hot the planet is. And because the signals come from different altitudes, the scientists can measure the temperature difference across the atmosphere. Lower down on the planet, temperatures are believed to drop to a still-scorching 1,700°C (3,100°F). To measure the wind, the team measured how the sodium lines were ‘blueshifted’ - meaning its light was stretched in such a way to indicate it was coming towards us. The planet (shown) was already known to orbit 13 times closer to its star that Mercury is to our sun, completing an orbit in just 2.2 days. But the results are exciting, because it highlights just how much information we can glean from a distant world with limited technologies . And this blueshift suggests winds are coming from a circulation process on the planet – or, in other words, superfast winds. Comparable measurements of this planet have been made before, using large ground-based telescope (with mirrors up to 10 metres in size) and the Hubble Space Telescope. But this research used a comparatively small telescope, just 3.6 metres wide, at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in La Silla, Chile. The research opens up the opportunity of studying atmospheres of distant exoplanets without having to resort to giant observatories or space telescopes.","Swiss researchers examined the 'Hot Jupiter' planet HD 189733b .

"The Dawn spacecraft has captured amazing new images of the mystery bright spots on the dwarf planet Ceres, which continue to baffle scientists. In particular, the images show the brightest spot and its companion standing out against the darker surroundings. But experts are still at a loss to explain the composition and source of the bright spots. Scroll down for video . Nasa scientists in California have revealed new images of the dwarf planet Ceres. They reveal new views of the two brightest spots in a crater (shown). However, scientists are still not able to explain what they are. Dawn will begin its first science orbit around Ceres on 23 April . These latest images were taken on 14 and 15 April from a distance of 14,000 miles (22,000km) from the north pole of Ceres. Several theories are currently being touted for what these mysterious bright white spots are on Ceres. The Hubble Space Telescope has found more than 10 on the surface, but Ceres has found that the two most prominent - ‘spot 5’ - are in a crater about 57 miles (92km) wide. One theory is that they are salt flats that are reflecting sunlight, left on the surface by saltwater. Another theory is that they are regions of ice, again reflecting sunlight. Ceres is thought to have plenty of ice beneath its surface, which could be exposed when a asteroid or comet strikes the surface. The fact these bright spots are in a crater - where such an impact occurred - supports this theory. Another possibility is that they are cryovolcanoes - volcanoes that are shooting out water or ice. However, the lack of a raised area around the spots consistent with a volcano suggests this might not be correct. And they could even be water vapour ejecting from a liquid reservoir under the ground, although again current observations - namely a lack of additional material near the spots - suggests this is not the case. As the spacecraft gets closer to the dwarf planet and moves around it, more and more of the surface is coming into view. The two brightest spots seen in a crater are known as ‘spot 5’. The scale in the image is about 1.3 miles (2.1km) per pixel, almost 70 per cent better than previous images. But the origin of the bright spots remains a mystery for now - with theories ranging from exposed ice to volcanoes. Salt flats or ice seem to be the predominant theories at the moment, with the bright spots appearing to reflect incoming sunlight towards the spacecraft’s cameras. Until Dawn gets closer, though, it’s unlikely the mystery will be resolved. ‘It’s too early to say what they are,’ Dr Marc Rayman, Dawn's mission director and chief engineer, told MailOnline. ‘Some people have offered they might be ice, but I don’t consider that necessarily the most likely explanation.’ Dr Rayman says he favours the theory that they could be ‘salty deposits', left over from perhaps saltwater’ on the surface. But one thing that can be ruled out is that they are their own sources of light. Dr Rayman is certain they are simply reflecting sunlight. ‘They’re mysterious but not bizarre,’ he said. This animation, made using new images taken by Dawn, shows how the bright spots become visible when they pass the 'terminator' - the line where the planet is split between sunlight and darkness. Credit: Nasa . In this close up view, the two different spots can clearly be seen. Several theories currently exist for what they might be, with the favoured being salt flats or ice - both reflecting sunlight . Nasa's Dawn spacecraft (artist's illustration shown) made its way to Ceres after leaving the asteroid Vesta in 2012. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres is seen as being a record of the early solar system, and may also have shifting ice on its surface . Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. It is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star, allowing ice to melt and reform. Nasa's Dawn spacecraft made its way to Ceres after leaving the asteroid Vesta in 2012. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres is seen as being a record of the early solar system, and may also have shifting ice on its surface. Dawn continues to get closer to the dwarf planet and on 23 April it will descend to a circular orbit 8,400 miles (13,500km) above the surface. It will then begin its first mapping phase of the dwarf planet in this so-called science orbit, travelling from pole to pole to image the entire surface. Three more science orbits are planned, with the spacecraft mapping the comet in increasing detail. Up until December it will periodically descend lower and lower until it reaches an altitude of just 225 miles (260km) above the surface, with images 100 times better than those taken so far. This is lower than the orbital height of the ISS around Earth – and will allow Dawn to snap glorious images of Ceres’ surface, including its mysterious bright spots. These latest images (close up view of the bright spots in the crater on the right) were taken on 14 and 15 April from a distance of 14,000 miles (22,000km) from the north pole of Ceres . Dawn is continuing to get closer to the dwarf planet Ceres (position in the solar system shown left), and on 23 April it will descend to a circular orbit 8,400 miles (13,500km) above the surface - its first science orbit. Three more are planned by the end of the year (orbital paths shown right) ‘The approach imaging campaign has completed successfully by giving us a preliminary, tantalising view of the world Dawn is about to start exploring in detail. It has allowed us to start asking some new and intriguing questions,' said Dr Rayman said in a statement. Dawn became the first spacecraft to orbit a dwarf planet on 6 March, having left the giant asteroid Vesta in 2012. Both Vesta and Ceres are in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and were on their way to forming planets before their development was interrupted - likely by the gravity of Jupiter.","Nasa scientists in California reveal new images of dwarf planet Ceres .

"Poundland has posted annual sales exceeding the £1billion mark for the first time in yet another sign of the discount stores' sustained challenge to established supermarket retailers. The company, which began as a single shop in Burton-on-Trent 25 years ago, has  become Europe's largest single-price discount retailer. The firm revealed yesterday total revenue over the 12-month period - excluding its Spain interests - grew 11.8 per cent to just over £1.1 billion, breaking through the £1bn barrier for the first time and matching more established retailers such as WH Smith. Poundland has become Europe's largest single-price discount retailer, with a trial expansion into Spain currently underway . Profits are expected to be around £44million as the firm reaps the rewards from its 547 UK stores and 41 shops in Ireland. With recession-era shopping habits entrenched, discount retailers are taking sales from Britain's 'big four' supermarkets - transforming the British High Street. 'Discounters have always been part of the retail scene, catering for people who didn't have a lot of money,' retail analyst Clive Black told The Guardian. 'What happened was that in 2011 the UK became a country that didn't have a lot of money and bargain hunting became a national pastime and not just the preserve of people on low incomes.' Steve Smith (pictured) founded Poundland in 1990 then sold it for £50 million a decade later . Poundland said it had opened 60 net new stores in the UK and Ireland and had a strong pipeline of openings for the new year. On the back of yesterday's figures, Poundland's chief executive Jim McCarthy said: 'After a solid quarter of sales growth, Poundland's revenue for the 2015 financial year was over £1billion for the first time. 'Despite tough trading conditions, Poundland continues to perform well and we served an average of 5.3 million shoppers a week during the quarter. 'We managed our costs and cash well, and we expect underlying pre-tax profits to be in line with market expectations for the year as a whole.' Originally founded by entrepreneur Steve Smith in 1990, the company snowballed from a small private enterprise into a High Street revolution, which involved buying up unwanted stock and end-of-lines, then swiftly getting them into the shops to sell cheaply. This strategy has since been adopted by bargain chains such as Aldi and Lidl, all of which have eaten into a market once dominated by the supermarket chains such as Waitrose, Tesco and Sainsbury's. Back then, shoppers were beginning to desert the High Street for superstores, but Mr Smith and his Poundland chain - which he sold in 2000 for £50million - were a lifeline that helped keep it afloat. Steve Smith grew up helping his father run a stall at Bilston market in the West Midlands, before opening his first Poundland store in 1990 at the age of 18. He has previously said his inspiration was his hardworking father, who ditched his job to become a trader when he realised it brought in more money. And it was at his father's market stall he discovered the basics of business. Most significantly, he realised the box contain cut-price items that had lost their packaging was particularly popular. The box formed the inspiration for Poundland, and a few years later, he convinced a shopping centre in Burton-on-Trent to open a store, where he sold £13,000 of stock on the first day. By the time he sold his share of the company for £50million in 2000, the business had a million customers a week and employed 6,000 people.","The discount chain yesterday posted annual sales exceeding £1 billion .

"A former TSA agent claims groping happens every day at security checkpoints across the United States and staff routinely bend the rules to get their hands on passengers. Jason Edward Harrington, who worked with the government agency for six years, added screeners will often pull attractive travellers aside so they can inappropriately touch them and will conduct bag checks on people they simply do not like. His comments follow revelations that two TSA workers were fired for manipulating body scanners in Denver as part of a scheme to pat men down before they boarded their flights. Writing for TIME magazine, he said the case was disturbing but admitted it came as no surprise to him. Allegations: Jason Edward Harrington, who worked with the TSA for six years, claims groping is a daily occurrence at security checkpoints across the country and said staff of 'bending the rules' so they could inappropriately touch passengers (file picture) 'Over the course of my six years with the TSA, the leveraging of rules and surveillance tools to abuse passengers was a daily checkpoint occurrence,' he said. 'And while it’s easy to focus all the blame on the two unsavory screeners who are now no longer with the agency, perhaps the bigger issue here is a systemic one: There are far too many federal hands on people’s private parts in airports. He added: 'Perhaps the most disturbing part of the sexual assault of male passengers at Denver International via full-body scanners is that the victims will likely never even know they were assaulted, since so many passengers have their private parts fondled when passing through the scanners, anyway. 'It’s difficult to tell where airport security ends and sexual assault begins these days. Pat-downs of people’s sensitive areas should be much rarer than they are at the airport.' Mr Harrington also alleged the body scanners, that are used by millions of Americans every year, are 'practically useless'. 'The TSA, in its rush to replace the controversial “nude” radiation scanners that they phased out in 2013, swapped out one poorly functioning line of machines for another. 'The current millimeter wave scanners, with their outrageous false-positive rates, regularly cause unnecessary pat-downs: The agent running his or her hands over you after you pass through the scanner is almost never doing it for a good reason.' The sackings follow a number of controversies over the screening of passengers at U.S. airports since 2010, when the agency adopted heightened security measures including full body imaging and pat downs. In November, a TSA employee tipped off the agency that a male screener at the airport told her he groped male passengers he found attractive, according to a Denver police report. In response, an investigator went to the airport in February and saw the screener signal to a female colleague when a certain male passenger entered the screening area, the police report said. Scandal: His comments follow revelations that two TSA workers were fired for manipulating body scanners in Denver (security pictured) as part of a scheme to pat men down as they passed through security checks . The woman colleague used a touchscreen system to categorize the passenger falsely as a female, which caused a scanning machine erroneously to detect an anomaly and trigger a pat-down of the passenger, the police report said. The investigator watched as the male screener then used that opportunity to pat down the passenger's groin and buttocks, according to the police report. The woman screener was later interviewed by the investigator and told him she had participated in the pat-down scheme at least 10 other times. ""These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable. TSA has removed the two officers from the agency,"" the TSA said in a statement. The names of the two fired TSA screeners were withheld from the Denver police report released to the media. The TSA submitted its findings to Denver police, who turned the case over to the district attorney's office for a possible charge of unlawful sexual contact. None of the passengers believed to have been touched by the screener could be identified, so prosecutors declined to file that charge, said office spokeswoman Lynn Kimbrough. Potential victims have already began contacting the TSA and, as the investigation continues, criminal charges could come in the future. Earlier this month it was also revealed the TSA would 'enhance' pat-down training following complaints from African-American women that they were being racially targeted for unnecessary screenings.","Jason Edward Harrington worked for the government agency for six years .

"He has spent more than £40,000 on tattoos and body modifications in a bid to 'be the person I want to be' but Matthew Whelan, 35, from Birmingham, says his unusual looks have made it difficult to find work. Thanks to workplace discrimination, he claims, he has been forced to go it alone and is now planning to set up his own business. Mr Whelan, who officially changed his name to King of Inkland King Body Art The Extreme Ink-ite but goes by Body Art for short, has covered every inch of his body in elaborate inkings. Discrimination: Mr Body Art says prejudice against people with body modifications has affected his career . 'I've got my face covered in tattoos, I've got various animals and I've got a giant snake on top of my head,' he explains. 'My eyeballs are stained, it's also known as an eyeball tattoo. I've got pirates on me, aliens on me and I've got a blue penis. My penis is blue.' He also had his nipples cut off six months ago in a bid to provide himself with a smoother canvas and keeps the discarded body parts in his freezer 'next to my sprouts'. For all that though, Mr Body Art says employers should take him seriously and look beyond his personal appearance to what's inside. 'I personally find it really difficult to get my head around it because there are companies out there that employ people on merit,' he fumes. Legal: Mr Body Art shows off a passport emblazoned with his unusual self-chosen name . Official: Letters arrive addressed to King of Inkland King Body Art The Extreme Ink-ite - Body Art for short . 'There are [body] modified friendly companies. But the majority are like: ""Look at these people! You look different from everyone in our office. You're different. You don't fit our criteria. We're not employing you."" That's frustrating.' Now Mr Body Art is planning to solve the problem by striking out on his own and has begun making preparations for his new career by attending business seminars in his home city. His spare time is being spent helping the local branch of the Liberal Democrats campaign ahead of the election, although he admits that people often wish to talk about his body modifications rather than Lib Dem policies. 'Dealing with people shouldn't be a challenge,' he adds. 'Is that right? No, it's not. It's a blatant form of discrimination. Blank canvas: Mr Body Art shows off his nipples - they were removed to give him a smoother canvas . Covered: Mr Body Art's £40,000 tattoo collection covers him, quite literally, from head to toe . Striking out: Mr Body Art, seen here at a business conference, plans to set up a company of his own . 'I'm not after sympathy of any kind. Most modified people aren't. I'd just like to be given a chance.' Mr Body Art, who appears on a Channel 5 documentary entitled 2,000 Tattoos, 40 Piercings and a Pickled Ear tonight, hasn't always had the acceptance he craves - even within his own family. His father Patrick has found his son's penchant for inking particularly hard to come to terms with and worries it might frustrate his plans for business success. 'I've never understood it and he knows I've never understood it,' he says. 'I can't come to terms with it. But I've accepted it. 'I'm not happy with it. I'd love him to be the son that I knew but he has chosen his own way of life.' Mr Whelan Sr says he finds his son's name change particularly hard to accept and wants to continue calling him Matthew as he always has. Mr Body Art, however, has different ideas. 'I legally changed [my name], I abandoned [the old one] and I've got a new name so call me by that,' he insists. 'We don't really talk about my tattoos but when it does crop up, it can get passionate,' adds Mr Body Art. 'But I believe in my tattoos. I am who I am.'","Matthew Whelan, 35, from Birmingham has spent £40,000 on tattoos .

"Apple CEO Tim Cook described the company’s eagerly anticipated watch as ‘the most personal device we’ve ever created’. And it may be the California-based firm’s most durable too. A sapphire glass screen used in the device has remained scratch-free after being subjected to being rubbed with sandpaper, keyed and even hit with a hammer. Scroll down for video . A sapphire glass screen used in the device has remained unscratched after being subjected to being rubbed against a stone wall (pictured) and with sandpaper, keyed and even hit with a hammer . The test was carried out by Cardiff-based iPhone repairs specialist iPhoneFixed.co.uk, which used a sapphire screen from a 38mm Apple Watch for its experiment. Two out of the three models of Apple Watches, which are available to pre-order from today, have sapphire glass screens. Two out of the three models of Apple Watches, which are available to pre-order from today, have sapphire glass screens. The only one that doesn't is the Sport model (pictured above) The glass is made from synthetic sapphire, which is created by applying heat and pressure to aluminium oxide powder, before being processed to remove impurities. Here, it withstands being scratched by sandpaper . Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures and pressures. As the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass. The resulting glass is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on the iPhone 5S and 6, as well as to protect the phones’ camera. The Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition both have sapphire glass screens, while the Sport version has a strengthened Ion-X glass screen, which is thought to be more shatterproof. If the price of manufacturing the glass drops, it could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones. The glass is made from synthetic sapphire, which is created by applying heat and pressure to aluminium oxide powder, before the crystals are processed to remove impurities. The tiny round disks created are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass. Sapphire glass is said to be twice as tough as normal glass and almost as hard as a diamond. The regular version, which costs from $549 (£479) and the Edition watch, from $12,000 (£8,000) both have sapphire glass screens, while the cheaper 'Sport' version, costing from $349 (£299) has a strengthened Ion-X glass screen, which iPhoneFixed describes as ‘more shatterproof and impact resistant than sapphire glass'. To test the durability of the screen, it was rubbed against a stone wall and then with a coin, before being ‘scratched’ by a key. The video capturing the attempts at destruction, shows no scratches were achieved to the screen. It also withstood being rubbed with abrasive sandpaper at some force and hit by a hammer – albeit not very hard. The video showing the attempts at destruction, shows no scratches were achieved to the screen, even when a power drill was switched on and dragged across it (pictured) But most impressive, was the screen’s ability to withstand an electric drill being dragged across its surface, without leaving a mark. The test led iPhoneFixed to claim: ‘sapphire glass is pretty strong and virtually impossible to scratch’. Rumours abounded that the iPhone 6 would get a sapphire screen, but it didn’t, possibly because the material is expensive to make when compared with standard of tough Gorilla Glass. The test led iPhoneFixed to claim: ‘sapphire glass is pretty strong and virtually impossible to scratch’. Apple has revealed it will only accept online orders for its much-anticipated watch which goes on sale on the 24th April. The firm will show off the watch to the public for the first time from tomorrow at its retail stores and several special popup stores around the world. From tomorrow morning, customers will be able to pre-order their watch online. 'Starting Friday, customers can try on Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport or Apple Watch Edition to find the model with the size, finish and band to best fit their personal preference and style,' the firm explained. 'Everyone visiting an Apple Store will be able to view all three collections and get hands on with Apple Watch Demo to browse and edit different watch faces, and learn about Apple Watch's health and fitness features, Digital Touch, Siri and more.'

"ABC's World News Tonight evening newscast has officially overtaken underfire rival NBC's Nightly News in the ratings war for the first time in more than five and a half years. NBC's 288 consecutive week winning run had stetched back to September 2009 and the drop from the top spot comes two months after anchor Brian Williams received a six-month suspension for misleading viewers about his coverage of the Iraq War in 2003. According to Nielsen ratings, ABC's World News Tonight with David Muir attracted 84,000 more viewers for the week ending April 3, with the show pulling in 7.997 million viewers compared to Nightly's 7.913 million. David Muir's World News Tonight evening newscast has officially overtaken underfire rival NBC's Nightly News in the ratings war for the first time in more than five and a half years . As well as coming in the wake of Williams' suspension, the switch also follows a change in how the numbers are crunched which now prevents NBC from including repeat numbers of its newscast from overnight replays. In Williams' continued absence, well-liked veteran Lester Holt continues to fill in as substitute anchor at NBC. 'Lester Holt has led NBC Nightly News to great success over the past two months, and we continue to be pleased with his strong performance during this time,' an NBC News spokesperson said in a statement. 'We're proud of the caliber of our work and remain committed to delivering the highest quality broadcast for our audience every night.' NBC's 288 consecutive week winning run had stetched back to September 2009 and the drop from the top spot comes two months after anchor Brian Williams received a six-month suspension for misleading viewers . A source at NBC told Deadline that the news division had expected ratings volatility in the wake of Williams' suspension. The ratings race had become very tight even before Williams' high profile suspension. NBC remains ahead for the season with an average of 9.2 million total viewers compared to ABC's 9.1 million. Muir, who took over from Diane Sawyer last September, has already been the number one choice among viewers aged 25-54 for the past 14 weeks. That is the demographic upon which most news programming is sold to advertisers. World News also won the week among that demographic, 1.95 million viewers compared to NBC's 1.79 million. It's also unclear what impact, if any, ABC's ratings win will have on Holt's future on the show. Many inside NBC News continue to advocate for the well-liked veteran anchor, who has been a stabilizing force at a broadcast and a news division rocked by a series of missteps.

"This week the world has been amazed by the story of a German pensioner who is pregnant with quadruplets at the age of 65. Annegret Raunigk, from Berlin, is already a mother of 13 but decided to expand her family further after her youngest child told her: 'I want to have a little brother or sister.' Someone who understands Annegret's position well is Britain's older mother, Sue Tollefsen, from Essex. Scroll down for video . Sue Tollefsen on today's This Morning where she revealed what it's like being a mother to seven-year-old when she is now aged 64 . She gave birth to her only child, Freya, in 2008 when she was aged 57. Now seven, Freya has often asked her mother if she could have a brother or sister and as a result, Sue revealed that she did consider it. 'Freya went through a period of wanting a sibling and I looked into fertility treatment to have another child but because I've had health issues I decided not to push my luck,' she said on today's This Morning. The retired special needs teacher said 'in a way' she thinks Annegret is 'selfish' for having more babies at her age - despite leaving motherhood till late in life herself. She said: 'She has 13 children already, in my case I hadn't had any. But if she has thought about it and weighed up the positive and negative and said ""this is the right thing for me"" then that's her decision. I don't sit in judgement of anyone else.' Now aged 64, Sue told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden that she never intended to leave parenthood so late. Sue, left, became pregnant thanks to IVF when she was 57. Annegret Raunigk, right, is expecting at 65 . But after her father passed away, she became a carer for her poorly mother until her death in 2002, while juggling her challenging job. 'I had other things in my life, looking after my mum and having a responsible job, I didn't think I could handle being mum then,' she explained. 'I always hoped when I was younger I would have a child but thought I had missed boat.' Then Sue met Nick, a warehouse manager, when she was 51 and he was 11 years her junior. She warned him she was menopausal and they would be unlikely to start a family together. But after researching fertility treatments, they were able to conceive on their third IVF attempt after getting a donor egg fertilised with Nick's sperm and implanted in Sue's womb. Sue was delighted when daughter Freya was born although she admits she now wishes she could have had her sooner. She said: 'I don't regret having her but I do regret not having her when I was younger. 'The journey I have taken with her over the last seven years has been fantastic but what saddens me sometimes is when I look at her and look at myself I wonder how much time I have left with her. 'I'm hoping I can make 80 when she'll be 22.' Sue pictured with daughter Freya in 2012. She now wishes she could have had her when she was younger . Sue is now a single parent after splitting up with Nick amicably in 2010. She said the pressures of being new parents took its toll on their relationship. 'We grew apart because when you have a child your focus is on the child 24/7. The partner may feel pushed out or carries on living their own life as before, while you don't. My life took totally different turn.' As a result of her experience, Sue believes the cut-off for IVF treatment should be age 60. Following Sue's appearance on the show, This Morning asked viewers to phone in with their views on older parents. Brenda called into urge older parents to reassure their children about their health. She said her mother had her when she was in her fifties - and so was the same age as her friends' grandparents. She said throughout her childhood she felt terrified that her mother was going to die. Meanwhile Rachel, who has had six children between the ages of 18 and 40, said she's noticed a difference in her energy levels since having her youngest child at an older age. 'It's hard work, I don't know how women in their Fifties cope,' she said. But another caller, Andrea, who had her fourth baby at the age of 41, said she's fitter and healthier now than when she had her first baby in her 20s.","German pensioner is pregnant with quadruplets at the age of 65 .

A fifth (21 per cent) are too busy, believing that it takes nearly half an hour to return something each time, suggesting time is put ahead of hard earned cash. Confusing processes were also identified as a major deterrent to sending an item back for 22 per cent. The research commissioned by store chain Doddle found more than a third of adults have purchased items that they then don't want, but haven't returned to the retailer. Brits each have on average three unwanted and unreturned items. Amongst the most commonly unreturned items were women's dresses, shoes and trousers, which occupied the top three spots. Then came women's shirts or blouses, women's jeans, electrical equipment, women's jackets, homeware, jewellery and women's underwear, according to the One Poll survey of 2,000 people. Most people say it is simply too inconvenient to return the item, or not worth the cost . Doddle has introduced changing rooms to a number of its stores to make trying and returning online purchases, easier. The facilities allow customers to collect, try and return, online unsuitable items. Chief executive Tim Robinson said: 'Customers have become so frustrated with the processes for returning online purchases that they would rather forgo the cash from the refund, to skip the lengthy and inconvenient queues associated with the task. 'But it doesn't have to be this way. We launched Doddle so that customers can collect and return online purchases in less than two minutes. It's Doddle's mission to redefine online shopping by making collecting and returning parcels easy - and save customers' time and money.'","Brits each have on average three unwanted and unreturned items .

"She realised something was wrong when her grandmother struggled to use her knife and fork. Oscar nominee Carey Mulligan subsequently watched Alzheimer’s disease take hold of Margaret Booth. Now, 14 years after Mrs Booth, affectionately known as Nans by the actress, was diagnosed, Miss Mulligan has revealed her anger at how dismissively dementia sufferers are treated. Hollywood actress Carey Mulligan says more needs to be done to raise awareness of dementia. Her grandmother Margaret Booth, who she is pictured with here on a charity walk, suffers with the illness . The 29-year-old said she watched as her grandmother, a former teacher, develop problems with her memory. Mulligan, a patron of the Alzheimer's Society and said her gran hasn't recognised her in at least five years . According to the actress, 29, there is a ‘shame or humour’ attached to the illness, which causes memory loss and language problems. Despite being one of the greatest influences in Miss Mulligan’s career, having encouraged her to act and sing as a child, Mrs Booth is unaware of the extent of her granddaughter’s fame and appears to have struggled to recognise her for about eight years. Speaking about the disease, which affects 850,000 in the UK, Miss Mulligan said: ‘It’s quite quickly disregarded as being a sort of age-related thing, ‘Oh, granny’s lost her marbles’ – that sort of throwaway comment about somebody who has a brain disease… There’s not an awful lot of awareness in society.’ Mrs Booth was once a gifted piano player and a geography teacher, who took a great interest in her grandchildren’s education. But she began having trouble remembering things and would sometimes struggle to find her own home. And it means she has missed out on witnessing the success of Miss Mulligan’s career, which has seen her star in films including The Great Gatsby, Pride and Prejudice and her latest film Far From the Madding Crowd, which is out next month. The interview with Carey Mulligan appears in the latest edition of the Radio Times . Recalling watching the disease take hold, Miss Mulligan said: ‘One of the last times that we were at home together with her, we had a meal and she sat down and she looked at her knife and fork, and she didn’t know what they did.’ Ms Booth now lives in a residential home in Pontardawe, Wales. When one of Miss Mulligan’s films is on television, it is played by her carers, who wrote to Miss Mulligan to tell her ‘Nans is very proud’ of her when she won a BAFTA award for An Education. And every time Miss Mulligan begins a new play, such as Starlight which she starred in last year, her mother sends her a good luck opening night card, signed ‘from Nans’. Speaking about the touching tradition, Miss Mulligan told Radio Times: ‘She’ll put a photo of Nans in there, too. It’s really sweet. It makes me super emotional.’ Miss Mulligan, who is married to Marcus Mumford, lead singer of the band Mumford & Sons, first revealed her grandmother was suffering from Alzheimer’s in 2013, as she became a patron of the Alzheimer’s Society. Carey Mulligan meets a fan at the Far From The Madding Crowd premiere. Every time she begins a new play her mother sends her a good luck opening night card signed 'from Nans' with a photo of her grandmother . She said she wanted to make people ‘more aware in their daily lives of those who could be suffering with the disease’. And last year she wheeled her grandmother around a ‘memory walk’ in aid of the charity. Revealing her grandmother’s diagnosis, Miss Mulligan told Channel 4: ‘She hasn’t recognised me for about five or six years. That’s really hard. It’s really sad. But especially for my mum and my aunt and uncle. ‘She was a geography teacher and she was very passionate about our education and would always ask us about what GCSEs we were doing, what A-levels we were doing. ‘And I remember her one day not being able to remember the different subjects I was taking for A-level and I remember thinking that was something she cared so much about, that wouldn’t be something she easily forgot. 'And then it progressed from there, she would struggle to find her way home when she went out walking.’","Carey Mulligan's grandmother suffers from Alzheimer's disease .

"This is the moment police in Texas turn ranchers as they determinedly try to herd a stray buffalo. Dashcam footage shows the officers using their patrol vehicles to steer the one ton bison off the road and back to his farm near the city of Round Rock. As they beep their horns the animal, named Big Boy, continues to run along the sidewalk but at one point he veers in front of the police car and over to the other side of the road. Despite the detour, the buffalo made it home safely free of injury. His owner, 79-year-old Joe Don Kotrla-Chipps, told Fox News that Big Boy has got into bad habits recently and has taken to jumping over his fence. 'It's been plenty adequate for 25 years with all my other buffalo, but this one is a jumper,' the rancher said. Apparently Big Boy made it past electric fence and a barbed wire barrier to escape his pen last Friday morning around 7am. Police say they gave his owner a citation for violating the 'open range act' with inadequate fencing. On the run: This is the moment police in Texas turn ranchers as they determinedly try and herd a buffalo . High-speed chase: Dashcam footage shows the officers using their patrol vehicles to steer the one ton bison off the road and back to his farm near the city of Round Rock . Lights, camera, action: As they beep their horns the animal, named Big Boy, continues to run along the sidewalk but at one point he veers in front of the police car and over to the other side of the road . As a result, Kotrla-Chipps is reportedly getting a higher boundary installed. In the meantime Big Boy, aged five, has been relocated to another patch of land. It was a local resident who reported the animal's break for freedom  after spotting him on the highway. Police said officers and an Animal Control unit responded  to a 'loose livestock' report and they were able to lure the bison to a secure area. Athletic abilities: His owner, 79-year-old Joe Don Kotrla-Chipps, told Fox News that Big Boy has got into bad habits recently and has taken to jumping over his fence . Bid for freedom: Apparently Big Boy made it past electric fence and a barbed wire fence to escape his pen last Friday morning around 7am . Fortunately no one was hurt during the incident. Authorities later highlighted the dangers of the situation. 'These animals are large, quick, and could do harm if encountered in the wrong circumstances,' they noted. Along with buffalo, Kotrla-Chipps keeps a range of animals on his ranch including pigs, dogs and peacock. Touching in the recent drama he concluded: '[Big Boy's] an exceptional buffalo. And that's why I want to keep him you know. There's something there that's over and above all my other ones.'","Dashcam footage shows the officers using their patrol vehicles to steer the one ton bison off the road and back to his farm near the city of Round Rock .

"Jason Orange shocked Take That fans around the world when he quit the chart-topping band last September but he hasn't said goodbye to them forever. Busy man: Gary Barlow is preparing for his musical Finding Neverland to open and the new Take That tour to begin . For as the remaining members Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald prepare to hit the road as a trio on their new tour - opening in Glasgow on April 27 - Gary has revealed to MailOnline that Jason will be proudly cheering on his former bandmates. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline ahead of the premiere of his new Broadway musical Finding Neverland on Wednesday, Gary said: 'He wants to come to the shows, he'll definitely be there. I don't think we'll be able to get him up on stage but he'll be there.' Regarding Jason's departure, Gary added: 'I think we've gotten used to it. It was very strange to start with it but it's been over six months. 'We're just so excited to hit the road. People come to a Take That show expecting an extravaganza and that's exactly what they're going to get.' However, before Gary can get back to the UK for tour rehearsals, he has the small matter of seeing his musical open on Broadway. And as he waited for the premiere to take place in New York on Wednesday, Gary admitted he was feeling equal parts nervous and excited. He said: 'It's felt like a little secret for so long and it felt like it was never ever going to happen. It feels quite weird to hand over our little baby and have everyone see it.' It was the new Late Late Show host James Corden who first put Gary in touch with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein when he was looking for someone to write the score for his musical Finding Neverland. He'll be back: Gary told MailOnline that Jason (second left) is excited to come and see his former bandmates on their new tour . Speaking of James, Gary said: I feel like I'm going to owe him for the rest of my life and he's loving that at the moment. He's doing brilliant on The Late Late Show and if he'd have us we'd definitely go on and perform some songs from the musical.' Speaking about Hollywood supremo Harvey, Gary admitted he was surprised by how much creative control Weinstein gave him and co-writer Eliot Kennedy. 'He's someone that I'd heard about and I was really keen to meet him,' Gary told MailOnline. When he called me up I was definitely interested. 'I didn't know how he worked but now I realise he is a creative. He completely trusted our music. We've had an amazing couple of years.' And then there were three: Gary promised fans that they can expect an 'extravaganza' when they come to see the new tour . It's not goodbye: Jason Orange shocked Take That fans around the world when he quit the chart-topping band last September but he hasn't said goodbye to them forever . While Gary had a taste of Hollywood when he performed songs from Finding Neverland at Harvey's pre-Oscars party, he insisted he will be sticking to writing and not asking Harvey to cast him in a new project. 'The last time I acted was on Heartbeat in 1998,' Gary said. 'Diane, the director of Neverland, always calls me JM Gary and says she is going to get me up on stage. 'I cannot act whatsoever, so I think I'm just going to stick to writing and singing.' 'He completely trusted our music': Gary revealed Hollywood mogul and Finding Neverland producer Harvey Weinstein has been extremely encouraging since bringing him on to write the music for the Broadway musical . Big night: On Wednesday Gary's Finding Neverland had its Broadway premiere . That's what friends are for: It was the new Late Late Show host James Corden who first put Gary in touch with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein when he was looking for someone to write the score for his musical . Meanwhile, Gary admitted he is dismayed by Louis Walsh's recent declaration that his X Factor days could be numbered and said he hopes the veteran judge doesn't leave. Barlow exclusively told MailOnline: 'I really hope he doesn't leave. To me he's the life of that show. He brings the silliness to it and that's what everyone loves. He's a big part of it behind the scenes too. I don't think they should lose him. I think what could happen is he might leave and then they'll get to auditions and send a plane for him.' Stronger than ever: Gary believes that Zayn Malik's (second left) departure from One Direction won't stop the band going on to even greater success . Just as Jason Orange's departure from Take That shocked fans, so too did Zayn Malik's recent decision to quit One Direction. But Gary believes the remaining members Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson will come out it stronger than ever. Gary, who also saw Robbie Williams leave Take That in 1995, said: 'I think it's slightly easier for the band. You can lean on each other. I think it's always harder for the one who leaves. 'For One Direction it's just a transitional period. Like us their fans are very supportive.' Finding Neverland, directed by Diane Paulus, explores the Peter Pan book's back story and stars Matthew Morrison of Glee and former Frasier star Kelsey Grammer. Performances begin March 15 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre. Former co-star: Gary admitted he is dismayed by Louis Walsh's recent declaration that his X Factor days could be numbered and said he hopes the veteran judge doesn't leave .","Spoke to MailOnline ahead of premiere of his new musical Finding Neverland .

"Everything they say about the Maldives is true. The sea is breathtakingly cerulean blue, the sand as soft as flour. The air is so clear it feels like there might be a fourth dimension. The view from the sea plane is like a turquoise lava lamp as lagoons meet the ocean with swirls and circles of staggering beauty. And then, just as we start our descent to the little resort of Niyama, in the Dhaalu Atoll, a 40-minute seaplane flight from the capital Malé, two yellow turtles swim sturdily towards a reef. Sand as soft as flour and cerulean sea: Penny is hard pushed to find fault with her week in the Maldives . At the jetty, smiling staff give us cool towels and whisk us to our new home for a week - a superlative beachfront studio where a huge, modern sitting room looks out on to an infinity pool, a strip of brilliant white sand and that ridiculously blue sea. Look the other way and stepping stones lead through green foliage to a table and chairs while to one side is an outside shower surrounded by banana plants. Frankly, the place is bigger than my flat. It's hardly surprising the Maldives have been on the top ten of honeymoon destinations for years. You could easily spend much of your time getting all hot, bothered and arduous in the splendour of your well-appointed villa. But there is much more to do than gaze at sumptuousness. Obviously, with miles of sea to play in, you can swim, snorkel, canoe, scuba dive and sail. There is also a high-tech games room where you can learn or practice golf, shooting, tennis or whatever. Essentially, though, you're here to relax. The days unwind quietly for Penny, with snorkelling, visits to the spa and walks around the island . We take a boat about a third of a mile offshore to the sensational music venue SUBSIX, which is six metres (20ft) under the sea. As the sun sets, we have cocktails at Edge, the restaurant above. Light spills on to the man-made coral reef. Stars dapple the night sky. A slight breeze ruffles the balmy air. 'It's like the set of a Bond film,' says my rapt companion. 'We need someone stroking a white cat to say, ""Here's your mojito, Mr Bond. I expect you to die. Of happiness."" ' Edge's executive chef (an Aussie named Geoff Clark) serves up exquisite food. I've never had an amuse bouche which amused the bouche so thoroughly. Basil mousse, coconut caviar and a salmon square. I could have eaten the plate. Eleven hours later, it's off along the sandy paths to breakfast. Wow. The selection is amazing, from miso soup and curry to steamed vegetables, rice pudding and fruit. A sailing trip on a dhoni, an old Maldivian boat (left) is the icing on the cake. Even the fruit bats are happy(right) Actually, I'm not going to mention the food any more. Suffice to say that not only will you not starve or suffer from lack of variety, you will eat some of the most gorgeous food you've ever tasted. Meanwhile, some of us need a massage. You'd be hard pushed to find a more beautiful spa than the Lime Spa. There's driftwood and teakwood, white stepping stones and crystal clear water with floating glass globes, surrounded by lush foliage. Fruit bats hang upside down in the trees, cuckoos gently coo and a sweet reef shark bimbles along in the shallows as the sea tickles the shore. In the evening, we walk along the beach to the rooftop Fahrenheit bar and have a green coconut. Below, tiny lights sparkle in the pool while above is a canopy of stars. Bimble away: A reef shark is one of the many creatures Penny encounters during her stay in the Maldives . Clusters of paper lanterns light our way home. The days unwind quietly. We go snorkelling with Judith Hannak, the resident marine biologist. There are myriad coloured fish and also groupers and black tipped reef sharks. But the revelation is the beauty of the giant clams - bright blue, red, green and yellow ones. Stunning. 'The different colours are down to the salts and the algae,' she tells us. At dinner that night in Tribal, we sit with our feet in the sand, our way lit by candles and sconces. There's a full moon and the water gently thripples the shore. Can it get much better? Yes, it can. Yoosuf, our butler, comes to tell us that we can go out for a sail with Captain Shihan on a dhoni, an old Maldivian boat with a spacious bedroom, which is beautifully appointed with dark wood and a thatched roof. We lounge on a giant orange beanbag at the front and watch dolphins frolic and flying fish fly as the sun sets and the champagne bottle goes down. The next morning, it's all over. We fly back to Malé and westward home. Why do holidays have to end?

"Truck drivers in Victoria are dealing drugs from the behind the wheel of 60-tonne rigs, using secretive codes over their radio systems. In a report issued to the Herald Sun, Victoria police revealed that there is a distribution network of speed, ice and marijuana operating in the trucking industry and one in every 12 truckies tested positive for drugs while out on the road. Speaking to the publication, a former Melbourne truck driver said his colleagues were taking drugs regularly, and  meeting areas were often set up between drivers over radios using codes, where drugs were then handed out. Scroll down for video . A new report has shown that truck drivers in Victoria are dealing drugs from the behind the wheel of 60-tonne rigs, using secretive codes over their radio systems . 'Yes, some people take speed and ice but there is ­always going to be rampant drug use if truckers are ­required to work these long hours,' the truck driver said. 'Do you think these people are dancing and raving in their trucks? No, it's not for fun they are using, it as a tool to do their jobs.' 156 truck drivers tested positive for drugs on Victoria's roads in the past year alone and it was revealed that they are using their log books to roll out lines and smoke ice. Detective Inspector Bernie Rankin, head of Victoria Police's transport investigations unit, said these flippant drivers were treating other motorists like roadkill and are risking everyone's lives. 156 truck drivers tested positive for drugs on Victoria's roads in the past year alone and it was revealed that they are using their log books to roll out lines and smoke ice . 'There are various ways these distribution networks are working. Often it's from a geographical location, they might know a driver who is involved in the industry, a pick-up point or there might be a loading area where there will be someone with illicit substances,' Inspector Rankin said. The news comes after a worrying video has appeared online in February exposing a truck driver snorting drugs from behind the wheel of a heavy vehicle before taking to the road. The shocking footage shows that many drivers are rorting the system so they can drive for up to 16 hours a day. One truck driver filmed himself lighting up a pipe filled with Ice (methamphetamine) and taking to the Hume Highway in an A Current Affair report. A worrying video appeared online in February exposing a truck driver (above) snorting drugs from behind the wheel of a heavy vehicle before taking to the road . The driver was embarking on a 12 hour shift on the Hume Highway, which is an 807km road between Melbourne and Sydney . 'And yep… Fatigue about to be managed. Get it into ya,' the driver says in the clip, where he documented how and when he took the substances, telling viewers that he snorted the drug off his log book and also used a pipe. The horrifying part is that the trucker is behind a 40-tonne truck and is just about to embark on his 12 hour shift on the Hume Highway, which is an 807km road between Melbourne and Sydney. When cornered by Martin King from A Current Affair, the driver denied his involvement in the video and refused to comment. However, Simon Green, a former employee of the same company where the 'lunatic truckie' works said drugs are rampant in the trucking industry. Mr Green, who used to take part in recreational drug taking while he was a truck driver, now admits that it was dangerous and stupid but claims it is easy to get around the police and it is cheaper than you would think. The shocking footage comes after it has emerged that one in 12 truckies are high on illicit substances when they are pulled over by Victorian police and many are rorting the system so they can drive for up to 16 hours a day . One truck driver (pictured) has filmed himself lighting up a pipe filled with Ice (methamphetamine) and taking to the highway in a new A Current Affair report . When NSW police busted Mr Green for driving while under the influence of drugs, he lost his licence for a year and is now clean. He said the general public would be stunned if they knew the extent to which illicit substances are used by truckies out on the road in their rigs. 'I'd say at least 10 per cent of the drivers out there are doing it right now,' Mr Green said. However, speaking to the program, Inspector Bernie Rankin said he had underestimated the figure, claiming one in 12 heavy vehicle drivers test positive for drugs when they are pulled over. The horrifying part is that the trucker is behind a 40-tonne truck and is just about to embark on his 12 hour shift on the road . one in 12 heavy vehicle drivers test positive for drugs like Ice (pictured) when they are pulled over. Mr Green said he knew his limits when it came to taking the drug, but Inspector Rankin claims that is 'absolute nonsense'. 'A multitude of medical studies done throughout the world all reach the conclusion that ingesting these type of substances impacts critically on your ability to drive, observe what's going on around you and the ability to even control the vehicle you're in,' he said. According to the law, heavy vehicle drivers are supposed to only drive for a maximum of 12 hours a day. The diver acted innocent and denied his involvement in the video when he was confronted by A Current Affair . The shocking video shows a man inhaling a drug through a pipe while telling viewers that he is heading north on the Hume Highway . However, drivers have now worked out that they can manipulate their log books through a loophole and they can actually work a 16.25 hour day in 24 hours. Speaking to the Herald Sun, Inspector Rankin said they are concerned that illicit drug taking is contributing to the amount of truck crashes on the road each year . 'This manipulation of their work diary gives regulated heavy vehicle drivers the opportunity to drive in excess of their prescribed hours four times in a seven-day period and be non-prosecutable,' he said. Inspector Bernie Rankin from The Victoria Police Transport and Investigation section (pictured right) claimed one in 12 heavy vehicle drivers test positive for drugs when they are pulled over .","Truck drivers in Victoria are dealing drugs using codes over their radios .

"Former supermodel Christy Turlington Burns is championing the message 'It's what you do that defines you' for fresh-to-the-UK clothing brand, Lindex. The Scandinavian brand, which opened its first UK store in Westfield Stratford, London, on March 27, has also brought in 22-year-old German model Toni Garrn and Ethiopia-born Liya Kebede, 37. The models have been selected thanks to their work doing good things outside of the fashion world, showing that true beauty comes from what you do as well as how you look. Scroll down for video . Christy Turlington, Liya Kebede and Toni Garrn are the faces of Lindex's Spring 2015 campaign . Lindex opened its first UK store in Westfield Stratford on March 27 . 'I have learned that it’s what you do, how you do it and what you do with what you have that matters,' said the yummy mummy, 46. 'I like that this campaign is providing a platform for each of us women - Toni, Liya and myself - at different stages of our careers who are all doing more with our lives than just modelling. 'I think it’s a positive example to show that none of us are only as we may seem at a glance and that everyone has the capacity to do more.' Lindex wanted models who do good things outside of the fashion world for its campaign, so brought in Christy . Lindex is selling limited-edition #superrolemodel T-shirts to help raise money for Christy's charity, Every Mother Counts, as well as the Liya Kebede Foundation and Plan International's Because I Am A Girl. 'We chose to work with Christy, Liya and Toni as Super Role Models because we believe that the spirit they convey and the example they set will inspire our customers to consider the meaning of beauty – not only on the outside but the inside too,' said Lindex's Johan Hallin. 'The campaign message is that we can all do better.' Lindex is also raising awareness for WaterAid during its campaign with in-store activities and by donating 10 per cent from all sales during shopping events. All profits from the sale of limited-edition #superrolemodel t-shirts, pictured, will go to mum and child charities . Christy, who's gearing up for the London marathon on 26 April, told Red Magazine last week that giving birth has been her toughest physical challenge, but that now she's feeling 'stronger and healthier' than ever. 'Giving birth was probably the most empowering thing I’ve ever done physically. I was like, now I can do anything. I can run a marathon… I can run three marathons!’ Christy - who is mother to daughter Grace, 11, and son Finn, eight, with her husband of 11 years Edward Burns, 47 - had just given birth to Grace in 2003 when she was struck with a postpartum hemorrhage, causing her placenta to become embedded in her uterus wall. She suffered massive blood loss and was forced to undergo a painful procedure whereby the doctors manually tore her placenta free without pain relief - an experience that could easily have killed her had she not been in such good hands. Trauma: Christy, pictured with her husband Edward Burns, 47, had just given birth to Grace in 2010 when she was struck with a postpartum haemorrhage, causing her placenta to become embedded in her uterus wall . As a result of this traumatic experience, Christy founded the charity Every Mother Counts in 2010. ‘What I realised was actually how lucky I had been that so many women don’t even get to choose when they become pregnant.' 'They don’t get to choose whether they will be medicated, or have a natural birth. This is just how it is, and it’s not an ideal way to bring life into the world, I don’t think.' According to the brunette stunner, 98 per cent of pregnancy-related deaths in the developing world are preventable. But, as she points out, the U.S. is one of the eight countries worldwide where maternal deaths are on the rise. Dedicated: According to the brunette stunner, 98 per cent of pregnancy-related deaths in the developing world are preventable - a statistic she's determined to change . Christy, who became famous alongside Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Linda Evangelista in the era of the supermodels, now runs marathons in aid of Every Mother Counts. She said she is determined to strengthen the 'sisterhood' between mothers around the world, wherever the happen to be.","Liya Kebede and Toni Garrn join Christy as 'Super Role Models'

"One of Suge Knight's alleged victims claims the rap mogul growled 'I'm going to kill you' then 'everything went black'. In his newly-released police interview obtained by TMZ, Cle 'Bone' Sloan tells officers Knight uttered the threat then yanked on the gear stick. Police say that was the moment before Knight killed Terry Carter and tried to Sloan by ramming over them in his pick-up truck. Knight, the co-founder of Death Row Records, has denied killing Terry Carter and trying to kill Cle 'Bone' Sloan in a parking lot in Compton on January 18. Scroll down for video . Cle 'Bone' Sloan (left) told police Suge Knight (right) growled 'I'll kill you' before 'everything went black'. Police say that was the moment before Knight killed Terry Carter and tried to kill Sloan by running over them . Terry Carter (pictured) was killed, allegedly by Knight, in the Compton parking lot on January 18 . Sloan describes how the pair exchanged blows at the scene in January. 'He's mixing it up, he's f***ing with us and I caught him real good. Then he said, ""I'll kill you"". 'That's when everything when black.' Speaking to an LAPD officer, he claims Knight appeared to be reaching for a gun on the passenger seat while moving the gear stick. 'I don't if he was trying to put it in park or if he was trying to leave... I don't know. 'He started really reaching... when he said ""I'm gona kill you"", I thought ""oh sh** he's got a gun"". 'After that that's when everything kind of turned into a dream. I don't know what happened after that.' The audio release comes after pictures emerged of Suge Knight showing he had virtually no facial injuries when he was arrested. Knight was punched a number of times during the deadly confrontation, but close-ups taken by detectives show he only had a slight black eye. The images were released along with a number of key pieces of evidence as the court was shown footage of the deadly incident in Compton on January 18 for the first time. The footage, which was played by the prosecutor for the first time, shows Suge Knight's pickup truck (top left) pulling up to the driveway of a burger stand in Compton on January 29 . Just seconds later, there is a confrontation between Knight Cle 'Bone' Sloan and Terry Carter. Knight runs over Sloan's leg and then plows into Carter . Sloan is then seen lying on the ground in the aftermath. A bystander then runs over to help . Los Angeles Superior Court also released an image of the truck the rap mogul was driving when he ran over the two men . Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen reviewed the items before determining Knight, 49, should stand trial on murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges. The video shows Knight's pickup truck  pulling up to the driveway of the burger stand and Cle 'Bone' Sloan approaching the driver's side window. Sloan then approaches the driver's side window and punches the 49-year-old in response to a flurry of insults. Knight's pickup is seen backing up, throwing Sloan to the ground before the truck drives over his legs and then plows over Terry Carter - who died as a result. Among the other key pieces of evidence shown to the court were images of Knight taken immediately after his arrest. An hour-long interview with Sloan, who survived, describing what happened was also released. Coen ruled Thursday that there was enough evidence for Knight, 49, to stand trial on charges he killed Terry Carter and attempted to kill Sloan during a parking lot confrontation in late January. Knight has pleaded not guilty. His attorney has said Knight was fleeing an ambush by Sloan and others when he hit the men outside a Compton burger stand. The entire incident took approximately 30 seconds. The video, shot by a surveillance camera monitoring the drive-thru at the burger stand, continues until the arrival of a paramedic. The footage is likely to be used by both sides during Knight's trial. Knight's attorney, Matt Fletcher, has said the video appears to show an associate of Sloan's taking a gun off of him after he is run over, and jurors likely will be shown an enhanced version of the video. Knight turned himself in to authorities the morning after the incident. Detectives took pictures of him to try to show he did not have any serious injuries from the attack. Sloan's interview with detectives will also be crucial to the case since he is unlikely to repeat the lucid account of the event and his own actions that he gave investigators. In court on Monday, Sloan repeatedly said he didn't remember the incident and refused to identify Knight as the person who injured him, saying he didn't want . Another photo of the 49-year-old after he was detained was released by the court. Knight has pleaded not guilty to killing Terry Carter and trying to kill Cle 'Bone' Sloan.

"Czech immigrants were trafficked into the UK by a Roma family on the promise of a 'better life' were forced to work for free and sleep in cupboards, a court was told. The victims were lured to Britain but were 'treated like dogs' - being made to urinate in buckets and live and eat outside in winter, prosecutors say. The jury heard how the workers were kept under duress amid fears for the safety of their families back home and sent to work in dog food factories, food plants and car washes in Plymouth, Devon. But they were made to give over all their wages, forced to eat outside during the winter and do housework to pay off 'loans' for their board and passage, a jury heard. Accused: Petr Tancos (left) and sister Ruzena Tancosova (right) are on trial for people trafficking in Plymouth . The allegations of their shocking treatment were made during a trial of five family members at Plymouth Crown Court. Ruzena Tancosova, 34, brother Petr Tancos, 35, cousin Martin Tancos, 35, Nela Dzurkova, 26, and Katerina Kurejova, 35, all of Plymouth, are charged with people trafficking. All deny the charges. Police say victims would be threatened with violence by the gang who pocketed their wages and benefits - believed to be around £150,000 - and even made them shoplift. Malcolm Galloway, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said the five defendants, all members of an extended Czech Roma family, brought the immigrants over. He said a neighbour also saw one standing by and directing one of the men to cut grass with a kitchen knife. He said: 'These defendants entered into a criminal agreement to traffick other Czech nationals into the UK and then exploit them for financial benefit.' Mr Galloway said: 'They (the immigrants) came with a promise of good pay, a job and a future.' Mr Galloway said the family used various methods to exploit the men - including for example putting a notice on the toilet door charging £1 for its use. But the court heard that the men were also threatened with violence if they failed to comply. He said: 'They would put them up in their houses in Plymouth. The Czech nationals would sometimes have to sleep on the floor, outside in the garage. 'They would have to urinate in buckets and eat outside.' He added that police started surveillance after two immigrants went to the authorities. Officers then searched their properties on September 16 last year. The court heard one man, Josef Bukovinsky, told police he had been 'living with the gypsies' in the Czech Republic before he was 'sold to Ruzena' (Tancosova). On trial: Nela Dzurkova (left) and Katerina Kurejova (right) are part of a Roma family accused of illegally trafficking Czech migrants into the UK and 'treating them like dogs' Mr Galloway said he was one of 11 men who lived with Tancosova in less than three years at a former address in Plymouth. All five defendants are charged with conspiracy to traffic individuals into the country for the purpose of exploitation between April 6, 2013, and September 16, 2014. Tancosova, Petr Tancos and Dzurkova are also charged with the same offence again but applying to an earlier period between January 1, 2010, and April 5, 2013. Tancosova and Martin Tancos are further accused of acting as gangmasters in supplying workers to pack agricultural products. Tancosova and Petr Tancos also allegedly required a person to perform forced or compulsory labour between 2010 and 2014. Mr Galloway told the trial that Tancos was seen by neighbours at different addresses to supervise the immigrants. He said a neighbour of Tancos and partner and co-defendant Nela Dzurkova spotted three men apparently living in their garage. The woman told police she saw Dzurkova passing food out of the kitchen window to men who stood in the garden of the house eating from trays in winter. He said: 'She also saw Petr Tancos standing by and directing one of the men to cut the grass with a kitchen knife.' He said the man was on his hands and knees. Mr Galloway said the neighbour noticed that Petr Tancos encouraged his children to throw stones at the men. She estimated that between 10 and 12 men lived at the home at different times. Mr Galloway said another immigrant, Miroslav Ritter, stayed with Petr Tancos and Dzurkova at their last address. He added: 'He slept, in his words, like a dog under the window in the living room, in a gap between the table and window. 'He slept on the carpet with a blanket and a pillow.' Jan Banyak told police he stayed at the home of Martin Tancos and Kurejova and £600 a month in rent to sleep on the kitchen floor. Mr Banyak believed that he earned about £250 a week working in a factory, but he did not know where the money went. He only received about £10 from Martin Tancos. Mr Galloway said: 'He told the police they usually had to eat outside. There were 10 of them and Katerina Kurejova did not want them inside as there were only two rooms. They eat mostly tinned food.' He added that when police raided the address, they found two other men sleeping on mattresses, under the stairs and in the kitchen. Mr Galloway said Tancosova, who had four bank accounts, pocketed £86,517 in benefits over four years and eight months. He added: 'The credit turnover for the accounts, including benefit payments, amounted to £148,923.' Mr Galloway said police had not been able to trace everyone they suspected of staying at the rented homes of the family. The trial continues.

"A vast underground network of pipes could be used to transport freight and deliveries in a bid to end road congestion and pollution. The government has approved funding for Cambridgeshire-based Mole Solutions to develop the idea as an alternative to the conventional systems of transporting goods by road. The plan, called the Mole Urban project, aims to reduce the level of road freight within urban areas by using freight pipelines carrying goods in capsules to edge of town consolidation centres, where they would be collected. Scroll down for video . One of the Mole Solutions capsules inside one of their pipelines at their testing site in Northampton . A graphic showing how the Mole Urban project would work by sending freight in underground pipes rather than on the road . The firm is now looking to see if the concept could be used within the town of Northampton and if results are positive, a pilot could see underground pipelines installed to transport goods. The development project is set to last nine months and if successful could be rolled out in other towns, although it is still a long way from fruition. The proposal, would see the driverless capsules propelled by a magnetic wave produced by linear induction motors. A track has already been constructed in Northampton to test the capsules with data being collected on commercial and environmental influences. However, the firm say that even irrespective of the final results for the test case, the process established in the project can be used to assess other locations that have major congestion and pollution problems caused by excess road usage. The development project is set to last nine months and if successful could be rolled out in other towns . Dr Roger Miles, head of Mole Solutions told the Independent: 'Clean water is taken into homes and dirty water is taken away and we never really see it, while huge amounts of oil and diesel are transported by pipes and underground. 'Now we want to do something similar with freight, delivering goods to buildings and taking away waste.' The concept has already had funding from the government and is also attracting support from private businesses too. The company is already one of several businesses that have attracted support from the Transport Systems Catapult, a government-funded centre set up to support innovation in transport. The Transport Systems Catapult is currently working with the UK Government and over 70 major multinationals on ‘Intelligent Mobility’ inventions with major market potential, including driverless cars, underground sensors and freight pipelines. The technology comes after Amazon announced they had been carrying out a secret research project which would see packages from the company delivered by drone. Amazon has approached the British Government about trialling its flying Amazon Prime Air service in the UK. One of its prototype delivery drones is pictured . In December 2013, the internet shopping giant’s chief executive Jeff Bezos says that he wants to use octocoptors to replace postmen and cut delivery times to just 30 minutes. Customers would have their order dropped onto their front lawn by the machine which would fly through the air from a nearby warehouse with it clasped in a metal grabber. And last month, it was reported that Amazon is said to have approached the British Government to launch a trial of the technology in Britain.","Mole Solutions is developing the idea as an alternative to road transport .

"A 13-year-old girl has been gunned down by ISIS snipers in the Syrian capital of Damascus as she tried to flee a militant-held area of the city, according to reports. The teenager, identified as Zeynab Daghastani, was shot and killed as she made her way through the southern streets of the Al-Yarmouk Camp towards the nearby neighbourhood of Yalda. Zeynab was shot dead on the evening of April 7 last week according to a worker at the Jafra Foundation, an aid organisation working in the area. Zeynab Daghastani, 13, was reportedly gunned down by ISIS snipers in Al-Yarmouk Camp, on the outskirts of Damascus, as she fled the militants (pictured, Islamic State fighters as they captured the camp ten days ago) According to relief workers in the area, Zeynab was killed on Tuesday as she tried to make her way from Yarmouk to a nearby neighbourhood controlled by the Syrian Army (pictured, ISIS fighters in Yarmouk) The worker, named only as Nina, also revealed that activists and relief workers were also being targeted by ISIS, according to the IBTimes. Nina told the publication that she had got the information from Aknaf Bait al-Maqdis, a Palestinian rebel group who are trying to recapture Yarmouk from ISIS. Thousands of Palestinians have been trying to escape Yarmouk since the area fell under ISIS control on April 4, leaving 200 people dead in seven days, including children who were slaughtered in front of their parents. Around 160,000 Palestinians used to live in Yarmouk, just a few miles from the palace of president Bashar Al-Assad, but many fled after his regime began bombing the neighbourhood in 2012 during the Arab Spring uprisings. The district was soon surrounded and food, water, and electricity supplies were all cut off, with around 18,000 residents still trapped inside. Around 18,000 Palestinians have been under siege in Yarmouk since 2012, before ISIS fighters moved in earlier this month. Since then thousands more have fled, while many who remained have been killed . Those who have managed to escape Yarmouk since ISIS captured it have told of militants playing football in the streets with severed heads, and children killed in front of their families . The plight of those in Yarmouk was brought to international attention in February last year when the United Nations Relief and Works Agency finally managed to bring much-needed aid to the area. Hundreds of civilians were pictured packing the bombed-out streets, desperately trying to get their hands on and food available. It was estimated that, before the UN workers arrived, the average resident of Yarmouk was living on 400 calories a day, less than a quarter of the daily recommended amount. It was reported at the time that some had taken to eating stray cats and dogs in desperation, all while being shelled and bombed by Assad's troops. Their situation became even more dire at the start of this month when ISIS stormed the camp. Around 2,500 people managed to flee before the assault took place, but many were left behind, trapped when ISIS posted snipers in the tallest buildings surrounding the southern neighbourhoods. The plight of those trapped in Yarmouk came to light in February last year when UN aid workers were allowed in after years of siege conditions, and hundreds flooded the streets in search of food . Since ISIS seized control of around 70 per cent of the Yarmouk Camp, tales of their barbarity have leaked out as other Palestinians managed to escape their clutches. Amjad Yaaqub, 16, said he found Islamic State troops playing football with the severed head of a Palestinian rebel fighter they had executed. The teenager said he stumbled upon the scene after being beaten unconscious by fanatics hunting for his brother, a resistance fighter. When he woke up he walked outside his home and found the gruesome scene taking place. Other residents have also told of the fighters' barbarity. Abdel Fatah, 55, said: 'I saw severed heads. They killed children in front of their parents. We were terrorised. 'We had heard of their cruelty from the television, but when we saw it ourselves... I can tell you, their reputation is well-deserved.'","Zeynab Daghastani, 13, reportedly gunned down as she fled Yarmouk camp .
