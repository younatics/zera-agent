"JFK airplane cleaner Juanette Cullum, 48, allegedly stole almost $15,000 items from American Airline planes over the last three years . An airplane cleaner at John F. Kennedy International Airport stole almost $15,000 worth of items, including more than 1,400 unopened miniature bottles of liquor, according to police. Juanette Cullum, 48, was arrested after a witness allegedly saw her stealing property and informed American Airline officials, a Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesman said. Joe Pentangelo said detectives subsequently searched Cullum's Brooklyn home, where they also found 19 Kindle tablets, seven iPads, two laptops and a 'large amount' of toiletries, according to the Associated Press. The miniature liquor bottle were hidden in one of her closets, prosecutors said. Officials said Cullum admitted she had been stealing from American Airline planes for the last three years, the New York Daily News reported. Cullum has been charged with grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property and was released on her own recognizance.","Juanette Cullum, 48, also allegedly stole two laptops and many toiletries .

"US officials are expected to stop prosecuting families of American hostages who communicate with kidnappers abroad or raise funds and pay ransoms. A National Counterterrorism Center advisory group, ordered by the White House, is expected to recommend what would mark a radical shift in US hostage policy, ABC news reported on Sunday. The NCTC interviewed families of hostages, including the parents of journalist James Foley, who was killed by Islamic State fighters. The family of a US contractor held by Al-Qaeda militants, Warren Weinstein (above), confirmed they paid a ransom in an attempt to secure his release which was reported in the amount of $250,000 . Foley's mother Diane said that officials from President Barack Obama's administration repeatedly told her family it was illegal to try to raise a ransom to free her son, and warned that her family could face prosecution for doing so. The Obama administration has denied making any such threats. 'There will be absolutely zero chance of any family member of an American held hostage overseas ever facing jail themselves, or even the threat of prosecution, for trying to free their loved ones,' a senior official told ABC News. Meanwhile, the family of US contractor Warren Weinstein, who was snatched by Al-Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, confirmed it had paid a ransom to try to secure his release, which was in the amount of $250,000, according to CBS News. A spokesman for the family said it had 'made every effort to engage with those holding him or those with the power to find and rescue him.' 'This is an ordinary American family and they are not familiar with how one manages a kidnapping,' the spokesman added. Hostage James Foley was killed by Islamic State fighters. His mother Diane said that officials from President Barack Obama's administration repeatedly told her family it was illegal to try to raise a ransom to free her son . 'As such, they took the advice of those in government who deal with such issues on a regular basis and were disappointed that their efforts were not ultimately successful.' It was unclear what sort of advice the family received from US government officials. Diane Foley welcomed the potential policy shift, which officials discussed with her last week. 'There's a lot that needs to be fixed,' she told ABC News. She said the past threats were 'the straw that broke the camel's back. It was incredible.' A number of hostage families expressed outrage after US Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl was freed by the Haqqani Network in Pakistan a year ago in exchange for the release of five Taliban leaders held at the Guantanamo Bay military prison. Army Lieutenant General Bennet Sacolick, who previously headed the elite Delta Force counterterrorism unit, is heading the hostage policy review team, along with his NCTC staff.","Senior official said there will be 'zero chance' that family of American held hostages overseas will face jail or prosecution for trying to free loved ones .

"Shamed newsman Brian Williams's lied in his reporting to make himself look good at least 11 times, an internal investigation has reportedly found. The total, cited in media reports about the secretive investigation, would mean the trail of deceit from the fallen face of NBC's Nightly News goes far deeper than previously reported. Investigative journalists at the network have been poring over Williams's past reports and statements after he was booted from the top job in TV news, hunting down signs of dishonesty. Lies on lies: Williams, pictured above during his last Nightly News broadcast before being suspended, embellished at least 11 different reports, an internal investigation has reportedly found . Iraq shame: Williams fell from grace after veterans called him out after he lied about being on board a U.S. military chopper which was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, but miraculously managed to land . Williams was publicly suspended with no pay for six months after it emerged that he repeatedly told a self-aggrandizing, false story about being aboard a military helicopter hit by an RPG over Iraq. Further scrutiny of Williams's record turned up other questionable claims, including dodging rocket fire over Israel and seeing a body floating through the French Quarter of New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. Even more such claims have been turned up now, according to reports by CNN and the Washington Post. Both cite a briefing given to NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke on Thursday in New York City at which top executives were updated on the investigation. Pyramid of lies: The latest specific Williams tall tale to emerge dates to 2011 in Egypt's Tahrir Square. Williams said he stared into the eyes of mounted regime soldiers during a violent protest - while the New York Times says he was safely on a balcony overlooking the action . Trust me, I'm an anchor: Williams is pictured above being intereview by The Daily Show's Jon Stewart and claiming to have up-close experience of the Arab Spring protests . CNN said 10 puffed-up claims had been found, while the Post said the figure was 11. An earlier report in the New York Times, identified a particular incident, dating back to Williams's coverage of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. NBC investigators honed in on an appearance on the Daily Show where Williams boasted that he had looked into the eyes of mounted Egyptian soldiers in Cairo's Tahrir Square, and seen armed men beat protesters. From his conversation with host Jon Stewart, Williams implies he was in the thick of the chaotic pro-democracy movement. However, the Times said, NBC news broadcasts from the time make it clear he was in fact on a balcony overlooking the square from a safe distance. Close to the wind: Another questionable Williams claim comes from Israel's 2006 war with Hezbollah. Williams said rockets flew 'just underneath' a helicopter he was on (above), when they in fact seem to have gone nowhere near it . Williams is currently halfway through his six-month suspension from his roles as anchor and managing editor of the Nightly News. He was replaced by Lester Holt, who has kept ratings relatively steady. It is unclear whether NBC will put Williams back in the top slot when the suspension ends, or look for a way to get rid of him. Williams has reportedly been banned from speaking publicly about the investigation, or defending himself against any new claims. Industry analysts have said the NBC report is likely to prove significant as the network wrangles over what to ultimately do with Williams, who had signed a multi-million-dollar contract to keep anchoring the Nightly News through 2019. The findings could play a part in any legal discussions, it was suggested, with NBC gaining leverage over its employee by either agreeing to keep it under wraps or threatening to go public.","Former face of NBC Nightly News was suspended for lying about Iraq .

"A scientist has warned Britain is facing a collapse in society similar to ancient Rome - because we've lived too peacefully for too long. Australian historian Dr Jim Penman claims Britons today have lost the drive for innovation that epitomised the Victorian era as we enjoy a more comfortable standard of living. He has drawn parallels between modern-day Britain and 100BC in Rome - when the city was at its most powerful as it captured more land overseas and greater wealth poured into the centre. Historian Dr Jim Penman has drawn a parallel between the Roman Empire in 100BC - when Julius Caesar, pictured, was ruler - and Britan today, warning this country is heading for a similar collapse in society . Dr Jim Penman (left) has suggested Britons have lost the biological drive for innovation that helped huge social, economic and industrial changes during the Victorian era, ruled over by Queen Victoria (right) However over subsequent centuries there was a rise in social divisions, inequality and political tensions - which resulted in its demise. Making the comparison Dr Penman said: 'It was a time when democracy was moving towards despotism and in Britain we are now see that politics is becoming much more about individuals rather than political parties. The two-party system has started to break down',The Sunday Telegraph reports. 'We live in a golden age where there have been no major wars in Europe for three quarters of a century. But the economy is stagnating and we're having fewer children. 'And once European countries can no longer defend themselves, the end of national independence cannot be long delayed.' Dr Penman, of the RMIT University in Melbourne, made the claims in his book 'Biohistory: Decline and Fall of the West', and adds that Christianity helped drive social change in Britain which transformed the roles of women and children . Civilisations move in 'cycles' dependent on factors such as food supply, religion and conflict, while epigenetics - a field of study within DNA - explains how people's attitudes and temperament change over time and thus shape society, he argues. 'The First World War had an epigenetic effect in that mothers made anxious by the war gave birth to an unusually aggressive generation which was the main cause of the Second World War', he writes. 'But now we are becoming a lot less warlike and much more reluctant to fight. People no longer want to join the Army, or become engineers. People would rather do arts degrees.'","Dr Penman argues British people have lived too peacefully to innovate .
Rising inequality and division will lead to a collapse in society, he warns .
Adaption of genes means we are less aggressive or likely to go to war ."
"Take That have come under fire after it emerged the pop stars have still not repaid the £20million they owe the taxman - one year after they were ordered to do so. Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald, who embark on their latest UK tour tomorrow, were told to pay back the cash 11 months ago after the 'investment' scheme they put millions into was ruled invalid. It is understood the trio are dealing directly with HMRC but have yet to stump up the cash. Scroll down for video . Fury: Take That members (from left) Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen have still not paid back the £20million they owe the taxman, one year after they were ordered to. The band begin their UK tour tomorrow . A source close to the band said: 'They are not appealing the decision, they are dealing directly with HMRC.' The delay has been criticised by The Taxpayers' Alliance, with pressure mounting further by the fact that TV sports presenter Gabby Logan has already fulfilled her promise to pay back all the money she owed from the 'tax shelter' scheme, according to the Sunday Mirror. Andy Silvester, campaign director, said: 'Everyone should play by the rules, and that means paying back on time if HMRC say so. 'However, the real moral of this story is that we desperately need to simplify the tax code to get rid of the loopholes that those with clever accountants can drive a Take That tour bus through. 'Politicians make an awful lot of noise about tax evasion and avoidance but are addressing the symptom rather than the cause.' The Take That trio have not appealed against last May's tax tribunal ruling that the Icebreaker scheme they paid millions of pounds into was created as a way of exploiting legal loopholes. Repaid: Other well-known clients who used the Icebreaker 'investment' scheme include TV sports presenter Gabby Logan (pictured right). Unlike Gary Barlow (left), she has already repaid everything she owed . Prime Minister David Cameron used a Take That lyric during Prime Minister's Questions, directed at Barlow, where he said 'We want your money back for good' as part of a pledge to get tax avoiders to return £5billion . Money poured into Icebreaker, which used investment in the music industry to gain tax reliefs aimed at boosting the UK's creative industries, did not attract income tax. Icebreaker officials claimed that the initiative was funding music, supporting little-known artists to famous names such as Sinead O'Connor. But it was ruled by Judge Colin Bishopp that the scheme was mainly for tax avoidance rather than investments. Many of the 1,000 clients who invested in Icebreaker claimed they did not know the scheme broke any rules. David Cameron has previously used a Take That lyric during Prime Minister's Questions, directed at Barlow, where he said 'We want your money back for good' as part of a pledge to have £5billion returned by tax avoiders. There is no suggestion Robbie Williams or Jason Orange took part in the Icebreaker scheme, which saw more than 7,000 repayment notices, totaling £1.6billion, issued by HMRC as part of a crackdown. A spokesman for Barlow, Owen and Donald said: 'I can confirm that Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald have now received confirmation from HMRC that their tax affairs are fully up to date.'","Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald ordered to repay £20million .

"Seven female students, some of whom attend Brigham Young University in Utah, were catfished by the same 24-year-old woman who was pretending to be a man. The victims all believed they were involved in a relationship with a Mormon man living in the same state - only to find out they were being duped by a woman named Kayla in Texas. And the women had a chance to confront the woman, named Kayla, on an episode of Dr Phil that aired on Friday. Scroll down for videos . Seven women who were all believed to be in an online relationship with the same man found out that they had been catfished by a 24-year-old woman in Texas named Kayla . Kayla apologized to the women, saying she was trying to figure out who she was because it's 'difficult' to be both gay and Mormon . 'Can I ask what triggered this in the first place and why you've done it for so long?' one of the women asked. Kayla responded by saying she tried to figure out her life in the 'wrong way'. 'It's for the simple fact that being gay and being Mormon is hard,' Kayla said. 'Your church tells you, ""We love you, but we don't love who you are"".' In the episode she apologizes to the women, most of whom forgive her and say they would have been her friend in other circumstances. 'I'm sorry that I dragged you guys into my mess. Whether you believe me or not, that's up to you,' she said to the women. The women has spoken to the women for various amounts of time, ranging from a month to more than a year. Kayla had taken the identity of a man named Keagan, who goes to school in Montana. He apologized to the women who all had been talking to a Kayla, who used Keagan's pictures online . The women's faces all looked disappointed and shocked when Kayla first walked through the door, revealing herself as the person they had all been talking to . The women mostly wanted to know why Kayla decided to pretend to be a man and why she had spoken to some of the women for longer than others . Kayla had stolen the identity of a Montana student named Keagan, who the women had a chance to meet on the Dr Phil segment. He had no idea his identity had been stolen and apologized to the women for what had happened to them. One victim said that the man she thought she was talking to told her he loved her, while another said he became 'her perfect guy' and that it 'almost seemed too good to be true'. It emerged that Kayla was a catfish - someone who tricks others online by setting up fake profiles with fake pictures and names- after one of the women became suspicious and looked into the man she had been talking to. Kayla told Dr Phil that she 'didn't have any evil intentions' and that she was just trying to figure herself out. 'I created an online persona so I could figure out who I was, and figure out if I was gay or not and figure out if I wanted to be part of the religion or not.' Kayla, who now says she is gay, said. She added: 'Do I want to be part of the church, or do I want to be gay? And unfortunately, I saw myself in a position where I couldn't have both... You don't understand how difficult that is.' Victim Hilary Hayes said she had been texted out of the blue by someone calling himself 'Hunter Anderson' who claimed to have seen her at a party and that he was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The women appeared uncomfortable at times during the interview and some even rolled their eyes at what Kayla was saying. Most of the women, however, agreed to forgive Kayla for what she did . She told Fox13 that they would regularly text and talk and he even sent her flowers on Valentine's Day - but that Anderson would never agree to meet up. At the same time, another victim, Sara Vanwagenen, believed she was in a relationship with a man called 'Hyrum Young'. She too reported that the person they were in contact with would never agree to meet up. The pair eventually realised the texts they were receiving were from the same number and it turned out they had both been duped by a woman called Kayla, from Texas. Vanwagenen is reported as saying: 'I let this person into my life in a really big way. I was really angry and really hurt.' Hayes added: 'She just knew everything about me it was just really hurtful to find out that you literally didn't know anything about this person, not even something so foundational as their name.' New York Daily News reports that police were informed but that no action was taken because the woman was living in a different state.","The victims confronted the woman, Kayla, on an episode of Dr Phil .

"Two rare paintings used to plan the filming of iconic scenes in The Wizard of Oz have sold for £35,000 some 76 years after the film was first released. One of the stunning watercolours, showing the moment Dorothy, Toto, the Tinman, the Lion and the Scarecrow meet the Wizard of Oz for the first time, went for £25,000. The other, imagining the Emerald City, capital of the Land of Oz and home to the Wizard, sold for £10,000. Both paintings, from the brush of famed art director Jack Martin Smith, were used to work out how the scenes might look once filming of the 1939 Hollywood classic began. One of the stunning watercolours, showing the moment Dorothy, Toto, the Tinman, the Lion and the Scarecrow meet the Wizard of Oz for the first time, went for £25,000 . It is thought that after filming was over the studio - Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer - sold off the paintings. Little is known about where they were until they surfaced at an estate sale in the late 1980s. The current owner instantly recognised the paintings as scenes from The Wizard of Oz and snapped them up for a small sum of money. She has kept them preserved for the past 25 years but has now decided the time is right to sell them. Each painting was tipped to fetch $9,000 - around £6,000 - at Heritage Auctions in Beverly Hills, California, but ended up selling for an enormous combined total of £35,000 to an unnamed buyer. The other, imagining the Emerald City, capital of the Land of Oz and home to the Wizard, sold for £10,000 . Both paintings were used to work out how the scenes might look once filming of the 1939 Hollywood classic began . Margaret Barrett, Heritage's head of entertainment, said: 'Before filming started, the production crew's art team painted quick, off-the-cuff paintings of scenes which were then shown to the art director. 'He would then be able to plan how scenes were going to look before filming began. 'Jack Martin Smith was the lead artist and at the time would have just created these artworks very quickly but he was exceptionally skilled and they are now viewed as art in their own right. 'He went on to become one of the most famous art directors in Hollywood. 'When filming ended they were sold by the film studio. A woman then bought them at an estate sale 25 years ago, not as an investment but because she liked them. 'She has had them ever since but has now decided the time is right to sell them. The Wizard of Oz is one of the most-loved films of all time, pictured (l-r) main cast members Bert Lahr, Ray Bolger,  Judy Garland and Jack Haley . 'The Wizard of Oz is a beloved all-time classic and there is a very high demand for memorabilia from the film. 'These two paintings are very special and are attracting interest from all over the world.' The Wizard of Oz, starring Judy Garland, was based on L. Frank Baum's 1900 book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. It is now one of the most-loved films of all time, but on its release it was a commercial failure making only $200,000  profit. It was nominated for six Oscars but lost out to Gone with the Wind. It was only when The Wizard of Oz started being shown on television in the mid 50s that people fell in love with it.","Two rare paintings by art director Jack Martin Smith have sold for £35,000 .

"Forget stumbling into the kitchen in the small hours and waiting for milk to heat up with a screaming baby on your arm. A self-warming bottle that heats up in 60 seconds is among the latest gizmos designed to make new mums' lives easier. While muslin squares and cotton wool have been go-to products for mums for generations, gadgets on the market in 2015 include a machine that makes 'shushing' sounds to 'break the cycle of crying' and biodegradable nappies which don't clog up landfill. Scroll down for video . The new royal baby could be clad in eco-friendly biodegradable mull-cloth as opposed to disposable nappies . Pippa Middleton, left, is said to have bought the biodegradable nappies for her new royal niece or nephew . Pippa Middleton is among those embracing eco-friendly nappies and is said to have invested in £4-a-piece mull-cloth nappies for her sister the Duchess of Cambridge ahead of the birth of the new royal baby. Shoppers in Geneva, Switzerland, have reported seeing Pippa buying the nappies, which are made of natural fibres and are popular in Europe. While re-usable and biodegradable nappies are easier on the planet and will no doubt get Prince Charles' seal of approval there is also a wealth of products to make parenthood easier - whether you're royal or not. Yoomi's self-warming baby bottle promises to gently warm a baby's feed to the natural temperature of breast milk in just 60 seconds, meaning there's no need for Wills to even get out of bed when helping with night-time feeds. And if they're having trouble settling the baby and need to resort to the pushchair the royal couple can pace around the grounds of Kensington Palace in safety thanks to Buggi Lights flashing ladybirds, which clip on to the pushchair's chassis and come with white forward facing and red rear facing flashing lights - just like a car. There's no need to get cold hands while trying to get the baby to sleep either: Mummy Mitts attach to the handle bars of the pushchair, meaning you can take your hands out while the mittens remain attached. Headlights for the pushchair and a baby 'shusher' are among the latest gadgets for mums... ...or why not try mittens that attached to the pushchair or a giraffe to rock the crib? Koo-di's spout protector is also among the list of products you never knew you needed, stopping baby touching hot bath taps and protecting against bumps, with heat spots that change colour to indicate temperature. When it comes to bedtime the Baby Shusher puts an end to pacing round the living room for hours on end: with rhymic 'shush' sounds the device can be programmed to make 15 minutes or 30 minutes of continuous shushing. And if that doesn't work patent-pending Gerry the Giraffe attaches to car seat, cribs and baby bouncers to rock the baby for up to 30 minutes - just enough time to get your nails done. But if baby isn't sleeping because they're poorly look no further than the Spilly Spoon, a non-spill medicine spoon which promises to administer medicine without spilling it first. A self-warming bottle and a spout protector are other gadgets on offer . The Spilly Spoon is designed to look like a caterpillar and administer medicine without spilling it . 'There's a mind-boggling array of infant devices on the market, but just because something exists doesn't mean that anyone actually needs it,' Justine Roberts, CEO of parenting website Mumsnet, told MailOnline. 'For first time parents, it's almost impossible to predict which baby products will turn out to be essentials and which will gather dust in the cupboard. Feeding: muslin squares . Sleeping: Moses basket . Clothing: Babygros, scratch mittens . Medicine: Gripe water, Calpol . Toys: Fisher Price Chatter Telephone . 'One family will find that a multi-purpose travel system fits in perfectly with their needs; another may realise that all they need for transport is a sling.' And what would Sister Julienne, Call the Midwife's profoundly practical chief midwife - or your Granny - have to say? While there's no doubt many of today's modern gadgets can make life easy for new parents, when it comes to babies there are some things which have transcended time. Muslin squares, scratch mittens and Babygros still feature on 'must have' hospital bag lists, and many new mums come home from hospital and place their bundles of joy in Moses baskets. 'Our users also find that talking to other parents - about what you do and don't need to buy, how to budget, and the realities of day-to-day finances with an extra mouth to feed - is priceless,' says Mumnet's Roberts.","Pippa is said to have bought biodegradable nappies in Switzerland .

"The skull of a 66-million-year old Triceratops is expected to raise almost $2 million at auction. Known as Lung Wong, or the Dragon King, the fossilised item is said to be the world's largest intact dinosaur skull, measuring 9.2ft (2.8 metres) long. The auction is open now and the fossil is being sold by Hong Kong-based experts at Evolved. The Dragon King dinosaur skull (pictured) is being sold by Hong Kong-based experts Evolve. It is more than 95 per cent complete bone, is 9.2ft (2.8 metres) long, 5.2ft (1.6 metres) high and 4.6ft (1.4 metres) wide which is said to make it the world's largest example of such an item . The last time something of this size and quality came to market was when a Tyrannosaurus Rex fossil named 'Sue' was sold for £5.6 million ($8.5 million) in 1997. The rare Lung Wong fossil was first discovered in 1992 when rancher Ray Novakovich in Glendive, Montana reportedly found the tip of one of the dinosaur's horns. Owing to its size and a lack of resources, though, it wasn't excavated until 2003 - and since then is said to have changed hands a number of times. It has also been restored and preserved into its current condition. The skull is more than 95 per cent complete bone, is 9.2ft (2.8 metres) long, 5.2ft (1.6 metres) high and 4.6ft (1.4 metres) wide. The skull belonged to a male Triceratops that lived 66 million years ago. The fossil - first found in Montana in 1992 - is expected to fetch $1.8 million (£1.2 million) at auction. However, the experts have not revealed when the auction closes and MailOnline has contacted it for more information . In a statement from sellers Evolved, the firm said that a fossil 'of this magnitude and quality is only very rarely available for private sale anywhere, and never before in Asia'. The largest previously recorded Triceratops skull measured 8.2ft (2.5 metres) long but the creatures' skulls were said to average at 7ft (2 metres) In a statement released by Evolved, the firm said that a fossil 'of this magnitude and quality is only very rarely available for private sale anywhere, and never before in Asia.' However, the experts have not revealed when the auction closes and MailOnline has contacted it for more information. The name of the fossil is inspired by the symbol of 'strength, good fortune and longevity' in Chinese culture - the dragon. The size of the skull apparently also suggests it might be an entirely new species. The largest previously recorded Triceratops skull measured 8.2ft (2.5 metres) long, but the creatures' skulls were said to average at around 7ft (2 metres). 'If this [theory] is confirmed, the owner will be entitled to name the species for posterity,' the group selling the skull added on its official website. However, some experts have bemoaned selling such a prized fossil to a private benefactor, rather than placing it in a museum. 'Commercially sold fossils kept in private collections cannot be studied by paleontologists because they can only publish research on fossils stored in museums or similar institutions,' said Dr. Michael Pittman, a research assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong, reported Shanghaiist. This dinosaur lived in the late Cretaceous period, from about 68 to 66 million years ago, in what is now North America. It is known for its three recognisable horns, the two largest being 3.3ft (one metre) long and a shorter one on its nose, with its name translating as ‘three-horned face’ from Greek. It is thought to have shared its landscape with the Tyrannosaurus Rex, and may have also been preyed upon by the fearsome predator. Triceratops were herbivorous, with low growth being their food of choice owing to their low heard. The exact purpose for its horns is not fully understood, though. The favoured theory is that they may have been used for courting, although combat was also a possibility. The creature was rather large, reaching up to 29ft (nine metres) in length and 10ft (three metres) in height, and it weighed up to 26,000lbs (12 tonnes). It is believed to have been wiped out in the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event 66 million years ago.","The Dragon King dinosaur skull is up for sale in Hong Kong .

"Although once known as one of Hollywood's most infamous bad boys, becoming a father has turned Colin Farrell into a dedicated family man who puts family before chasing women. Having been linked with a string of the world's most famous beauties - Angelina Jolie, Demi Moore, Britney Spears, Elizabeth Taylor - the actor says he's now hung up his prowling boots. In fact, the 38-year-old has confessed in an interview with The Sunday Times that not only is he too busy, but he's not even interested in the chase any longer. Scroll down for video . Colin Farrell has claimed that he's no longer the womaniser we once knew, and hasn't dated in four years . The 38-year-old actor says that he's now focusing on resurrecting his acting career (pictured here in the upcoming second series of True Detective) and being a good father to his two sons James and Henry . What's occupying so much time for the man who was once nicknamed the 'Lusty Leprechaun'? The Irish actor is about to experience something of a comeback with a role in the much-anticipated second series of HBO's True Detective. He's also the face of the new Dolce & Gabbana fragrance Intenso. However he insists that his time now is dedicated to clean living and seeing his two sons James Padraig, 11, and Henry Tadeusz, five. It's a far more wholesome lifestyle for Colin who confesses he's glad that his drink and drug-fuelled days are behind him. He's now branded his arrival in Hollywood circa 2002 as 'too much' to handle in his early 20s, and he's now not only completely sober - he even enjoys a spot of yoga. Britney Spears accompanied Colin Farrell to the premiere of film The Recruit during the height of his party-hard lifestyle. The pair both denied any romance however, claiming they were 'just mates' And his love life is firmly on the backburner. Asked if he had any women his life, he replied: 'There is not one - zilch, nada.' Even more surprising however, is that after years of being labelled a womaniser, his now celibate - and happy with his unattached status. 'I have not dated for, ooh, four years now. It's just not happening, what with the work, the kids and my life. 'I know it's not what people expect to hear, but that's the honest truth.' The actor is now a devoted dad and although they live with their mothers (James with model Kim Bordenave and Henry with ex-wife Alicja Bachleda-Curus) he sees the boys every weekend. He told the Sunday Times's Style magazine: 'It's not all about you any more, which is a relief. It's about a bigger world, and helping them find their place in it. 'It's not about  ""me, me, me, the loudmouth"" any more - and that takes the pressure off me to live up to those old expectations'. He is especially protective of James, who has a developmental disorder called Angelman syndrome, which causes intellectual and physical disability. On the set of film Alexander, Colin Farrell was reported to have had flirtations with Angelina Jolie . Left: Colin married actress Amelia Warner, now married to Fifty Shades star Jamie Dornan, in 2001 in a ceremony in Tahiti though the marriage wasn't legal; Right: He was also rumoured to have dated Demi Moore . Colin certainly has a colourful dating CV having been linked to a Who's Who of actresses, models and movie icons. He and Jamie Dornan's wife Amelia Warner 'married' in a non-legally binding ceremony in Tahiti in 2001, the following year he dated Canadian model Kim, and conceived their child James. By the next year he was linked with Demi Moore, although they've both denied the affair and in 2003, Britney Spears accompanied him to the premiere of his film The Recruit but any intimate acquaintance didn't last with Colin insisting they were 'just mates'. Angelina Jolie is rumoured to have come on to him during the filming of Alexander in 2003, and he is said to have offered to read Dame Eileen Atkins, who was then 70, a book in bed. She refused. After Elizabeth Taylor's death in 2011 Colin admitted to being 'romantically' involved with the actress . Doting daddy: Colin Farrell has spoken in the past about how he has learnt to cope with his eleven-year-old son James' condition - Angelman Syndrome, a neuro-genetic disorder which can affect brain development . In 2006 the womaniser was enmeshed in legal proceedings over a leaked sex tape during a brief relationship with former Playboy model Nicole Narain. And three years later he met Alicja on the set of Ondine. They had baby Henry together in 2010 bu split up soon after. The Minority Report star's most bizarre liaison, however, was with Elizabeth Taylor in the last years of her life. He called her 'a spectacular woman' and described the relationship as 'romantic' and when she died in 2011, he read a poem at her funeral.

"The U.S. Supreme Court's . arguments on Tuesday over same-sex marriage will cap more than . two decades of litigation and a transformation in public . attitudes. Based on the court's actions during the past two years, a . sense of inevitability is in the air: That a majority is on the . verge of declaring gay marriage legal nationwide. Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's pivotal member on gay . rights, has been marching in this direction with opinions dating . to 1996. In his most recent gay rights decision for the court in . 2013, rejecting a legal definition of marriage limited to a man . and woman for purposes of federal benefits, Kennedy deplored . that U.S. law for making gay marriages 'unequal.' Scroll down for video . A moment in history: People line up outside the Supreme Court in Washington April 26 ahead of Tuesday's arguments focusing on gay marriage . That 5-4 decision did not address a constitutional right to . same-sex marriage, but lower court judges interpreted the ruling . as an endorsement of it and began invalidating state bans. When states appealed rulings striking down their same-sex . marriage prohibitions, the Supreme Court declined to intervene, . most notably in October 2014 when it denied appeals in seven . cases on a single day. Instead, the nine justices are hearing in Tuesday's oral . arguments an appeal of the sole decision from a regional U.S. appeals court that went the opposite way. Last November, the . Cincinnati-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit . upheld gay marriage bans in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and . Tennessee. With 37 of the 50 states now permitting gay marriage, many . because of judicial orders, it seems unlikely the country's . highest court would reverse course. Public opinion polls over . the last decade have shown large increases in support for gay . marriage. A ruling is due by the end of June. Yet some questions remain. How much will Kennedy, a member of the court's five-man . conservative bloc who often casts decisive votes in close cases, . show his hand in the 2-1/2 hours of oral arguments? Will he . reveal a clear view that the Constitution gives gay people a . right to marry or will he voice concerns for state interests in . controlling marriage laws? An element of uncertainty hovers over Chief Justice John . Roberts, who broke with the other court conservatives and cast . the deciding vote upholding President Barack Obama's healthcare . law in 2012. Roberts voted against gay rights in the 2013 . ruling. But he separated himself from the most conservative . dissenters and declined to declare outright that states may ban . gay marriage. He has demonstrated apprehension about the reputation of the . court that, by virtue of his service as chief justice, . informally bears his name. In his opinions, he has sometimes . tried to lower tensions in controversial cases and reassure . people that the court is aligning with precedent and public . expectations. The question is not only how Roberts might vote but what he . might write. In the 2013 ruling, he denounced the court majority's . sentiment that federal lawmakers were deliberately harming gay . people with the limited definition of marriage. 'I would not tar . the political branches with the brush of bigotry,' he wrote. For the other seven justices, expectations are clearer. The four liberals, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, . Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, have signaled their opposition . to state same-sex marriage bans. On the other side have been the . three most conservative justices, Antonin Scalia, Clarence . Thomas and Samuel Alito, asserting that nothing in the . Constitution guarantees same-sex marriage. Two legal questions are before the justices: whether the . Constitution's guarantees of due process and equal protection . cover a right to same-sex marriage; and, if they do not, whether . states that ban same-sex marriages must recognize such unions . performed in other states. Gay couples and their families, about 30 adults and 20 . children, have appealed the 6th Circuit's decision. The name . petitioner is James Obergefell, who wanted his home state of . Ohio, which prohibits gay marriage, to recognize his Maryland . marriage to John Arthur as Arthur was dying from amyotrophic . lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Officials expect the courtroom to be packed to its 400-seat . capacity.

"They are the images that capture the faces and dramatic landscapes one photographer encountered during a 1000-day journey around the world. Award-winning photographer Uruma Takezawa has made a living discovering and documenting communities in the most remote areas around the globe. For his latest book, the Japanese adventurer spent 1,021 days on the road, to capture amazing images on an odyssey that took him to 103 countries on four continents. During his several year-long journey, Takezawa found inspiration in those who live off the land in harmony with the natural world and the results are a spectacular set of dramatic images, which currenlty form part of an exhibition at New York's Foto-Care Gallery. Japanese photographer Uruma Takezawa snaps a boy wears traditional tribal make up in the The Lower Omo River Valley, Ethiopia . Born in 1977, the Japanese artist first began his career as a marine photographer, travelling the world to capture breathtaking underwater vistas. From there, he discovered a passion for photographing the unknown, travelling alone by bus, train, on foot and horseback to reach his far-flung destinations. 'The ocean and its seascapes had become so familiar for me,' he wrote. 'I desired to see the different faces of the world.

Armed with just a small backpack and his camera equipment, Takezawa endured many tough terrains to photograph his subjects, who are as cut off from the modern world as is possible in this day and age. His enlightening body of work is described as a celebration of the connection that exists between people and the land. From Brazil to Uganda, Takezawa attempts to capture the dignity and resilience of his subjects and the power of the human spirit of those who live off the land. Takezawa writes: 'It's a wide world - far wider than we think, and much deeper. That is the most important thing I learned from my long journey.

"An extremist preacher who is suspected of radicalising Jihadi John lives in a leafy west London street and cannot be deported because of his human rights. Egyptian-born Hani al-Sibai is believed to have influenced a number of young men, who then travelled abroad to join terror groups, including JIhadi John, whose real name is Mohammed Emwazi. The radical cleric lives in the same neighbourbood where Emwazi, who was unmasked in February as the notorious murderer in Islamic State's ruthless propaganda videos, hung out with fellow jihadists. Now, security services are believed to be investigating al-Sibai's influence on the London Boys terror cell of which Enwazi was a part. Scroll down for video . Egyptian-born extremist preacher Hani al-Sibai (right) is believed to have influenced a number of young men into fighting jihadist, including 'Jihadi John' Mohammed Emwazi (left) The Sunday Telegraph's Robert Mendick and Robert Vervaik reported that it is claimed the preacher 'captivated' a number of young Muslim men who went on to fight jihad abroad. Although it is not clear if the 54-year-old made direct contact with Emwazi, he does post radical messages on websites he runs that are reportedly very influential on young wannabe jihadists. He has also been linked to Adel Abdel Bari, another Egyptian-born jihadist and senior al-Qaeda operative. Bari and al-Sibai were close associates in London until Bari was jailed for 25 years for a series of terror plots earlier this year. And Bari’s son Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 25, is well known as an aspiring rapper from west London, who is is thought to be part of Jihadi John’s network inside Islamic State. Al-Sibai recently sparked controversy when he aired his sexist comments live on air leading the female TV host to cut him off abruptly . Al-Sibai's bank accounts and assets are subject to freezing orders by the United Nations, the UK Treasury and US Treasury. He was accused of having 'provided material support to al-Qaeda and conspired to commit terrorist acts' in court last year - which he denied. Last year, he went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg in a bid to get his status as an al-Qaeda affiliate overturned as well as and allow him access to bank accounts. But despite being identified as an affiliate of al-Qaeda, al-Sibai has blocked government attempts to deport him for more than 15 years - citing his human rights. When he first claimed asylum in 1994, he told officials he had been tortured in Egypt after acting as a lawyer for Islamist groups and was linked to the opposition Muslim Brotherhood. He was denied on national security grounds, and was jailed in 1998 pending deportation. Al-Sibai was a close associate of Egyptian jihadist Adel Abdel Bari, whose son Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary (pictured) is believed to be part of Jihadi John's network in Islamic State . But as officials were unable to obtain the necessary assurances to guarantee al-Sibai’s safety, human rights laws mean suspects cannot be deported to countries where they are at risk. So, despite being added to the UN's al-Qaeda sanctions list ten years ago, he has temporary leave to remain in the UK. The rent on his home in Hammersmith, which is owned by a housing association and reportedly worth up to £1million, is paid by the taxpayer, according to The Telegraph. And while in the country, he has regularly provoked outrage with his extremist comments, notably describing the July 7 bombing as a 'great victory' for the terror organisation. More recently, he made headlines after a female Lebanese TV presenter cut him off for making sexist comments live on air. Rima Karaki had been conducting an interview with al-Sibai on reports of Christians joining Islamic groups such as ISIS in the Middle East when the scholar went off on a historical tangent. When she urges him to return to the topic at hand, it sparked a heated argument - ultimately resulting in Ms Karaki ending the interview abruptly for his lack of respect towards her.","Hani al-Sibai is believed to have influenced a number of young Muslim men .

"A woman who ate four takeaways a week and smoked 20 cigarettes a day has shed eight stone after doctors told her she was at risk of suffering a stroke at just 23. Rochelle Holmes, of Bishop Auckland, County Durham, was told she had gained so much weight she could die before the age of 25 due to her bad habits. Her lifestyle meant she had ballooned to 20st 5lbs, but after receiving the stark warning about her health she decided to lose weight and quit smoking once and for all. But by swapping takeaways for healthy alternatives and controlling the amounts she ate, she managed to slim down to a size 12. Rochelle Holmes, 26, ballooned to 20st 5lbs (left) after eating four takeaways a week  - and she also smoked 20 cigarettes a day. She shed 8st after changing her diet and exercising and is now a size 12 (right) Miss Holmes, who works as a bakery assistant, said: 'Now I make sure a third of my plate is packed full of vegetables. 'I snack on apples and other fruits and make sure my portions are controlled. 'I'm proof that you can succeed and I want to feel healthy for the rest of my life.' The 26-year-old, who used to be a size 24, said she was always a 'big girl'  - but  began piling on the pounds in her final year of school going to bars and clubs with friends. A typical night out would involve several pints and bottles of Blue WKD,  a packet of cigarettes and then a greasy takeaway. By the time she reached 17, Miss Holmes was a size 20. She began to rely on fatty foods and would easily spend over £30 a week on pizzas and kebabs, meaning she never learned to cook or prepare a proper meal. She said: 'I was addicted to fatty foods as well as the cigarettes. I couldn't resist tucking into a takeaway after a night out and then continued when I was hungover.' Miss Holmes ballooned to a size 24 after going on nights out with friends and heavily drinking. She spent £30 a week on takeaways and kebabs and never learned to cook a proper meal . She was so overweight she became out of breath walking up stairs (she is pictured, left, before her weight loss). After slimming down to 11st (pictured right) Miss Holmes says she 'wants to be healthy forever' 'Then I became really miserable. I stopped going out because I didn't feel attractive any more. I was happy that my partner Chris loved me and that was all I needed. 'But when I wasn't going out drinking, I would rely on takeaways instead. 'It was a vicious cycle and I was comfort eating. 'Growing up, I was used to huge portions and watching my mum  comfort eat, so it ended up like a habit. 'I would never exercise and would think nothing of tucking into fish and chips, dumplings or pizza.' The reality of her weight gain only hit her when she attended her medical centre, in the hope of quitting smoking, and she couldn't climb the stairs without getting breathless. Medical experts warned her blood pressure was dangerously high at 145/90, a major risk factor for heart disease or a stroke. Miss Holmes, who lives with her boyfriend Chris, a 29-year-old baker, said: 'It was horrible hearing from a nurse that I had put on so much weight and combined with my addiction to cigarettes, that my life was in danger. She said: 'You are at a serious risk of a stroke and you're only 23 years-old. BEFORE . Breakfast: Huge bowl of Coco Pops and white toast with lashings of jam and butter . Lunch: Pre-made sandwiches from convenience stores . Dinner: Ready meal and chips or greasy takeaway from chinese or fish and chip shop . Snacks: Crisps, chocolate . Drinks: Full-fat fizzy drinks, blue WKD . AFTER . Breakfast: Porridge and fresh fruit . Lunch: Ham salad or omelette . Dinner: Home-cooked meal made from scratch using healthy ingredients, with one third of the plate vegetables . Snacks: Fruit . Drinks: Water . 'I was terrified that I could have died. I was completely scared to death when she sent me home with a heart monitor. 'I didn't realise I had let myself get this big but the shock was enough, it gave me the opportunity to change my life.' Determined to lose weight, she decided to join Slimming World for support. She said: 'Losing weight was really hard work but I stuck at it and joined a Zumba and kettle bell class. 'When I first went to Slimming World I was so nervous, but everyone was so friendly and now it's become a social event for me too. She added: 'People say it's expensive to buy healthy food but I was spending between £30 and £40 a week bingeing on takeaways. 'Now I always stick to my budget and I feel a lot better for it.' Miss Holmes' hard work paid off and she managed to drop six dress sizes, her blood pressure is back to normal and she hasn't touched a cigarette since. She makes sure she drinks moderately on nights out and avoids sugary drinks like blue WKD, instead opting for clear spirits with a low-calorie mixer. She can now wear flattering size 10-12 tops and dresses and can even fit into a pair of trousers she used to wear when she was younger. Since losing the weight, she has begun working as a consultant for Slimming World, wanting to help others in a similar situation. She said: 'I am now doing something that I love by running a business but also inspiring people to lose weight and using myself as an example. 'Chris and my group members are so proud of me for becoming a consultant and I feel amazing. 'I have confidence that I never thought I'd be able to have and I can actually cook now.'","Rochelle Holmes, 26, ballooned to 20st on a diet of pizzas and kebabs .

"Corinthian Colleges will shut down all of its remaining 28 ground campuses, displacing about 16,000 students less than two weeks after the US Department of Education announced it was fining the for-profit institution $30 million. In a statement Sunday, the Santa Ana, California-based company said it was working with other schools to help students continue their education. The closures include Heald College campuses in California, Hawaii and Oregon, as well as Everest and WyoTech schools in California, Arizona and New York. Corinthian was one of the country's largest for-profit educational institutions. It collapsed last summer amid a cash shortage and fraud allegations and its closures are believed to be the biggest shutdown in the history of US higher education. Corinthian Colleges, which was one of the country's largest for-profit educational institutions and ran brands such as Everest and Heald, will close its  schools after being fined $30million for misrepresenting job data . Corinthian CEO Jack Massimino (left) blamed regulators for his company's failure to sell its schools, which doubled revenue for the company up to $1.75billion between 2007 and 2011 . The Education Department contends that Corinthian failed to comply with requests to address allegations of falsifying job placement data and altering grades and attendance records. It agreed to sell or close its campuses under pressure from the department. Earlier in April, the department fined subsidiary Heald College, alleging the school had shown a pattern of falsifying post-graduation employment data. In one instance, the company's Honolulu campus declared a student had found work in her chosen field of accounting, even though administrators knew she was working at Taco Bell, the department said. The department found more than 900 incidents of false placement rates that were trumpeted to potential students and officials accrediting the schools, according to the Washington Post. The Department of Education also alleged that Corinthian would have staffing agencies temporarily hire its graduates so they could be counted as placements. Most of the company's former schools have been sold, and Corinthian attempted to sell Heald as well but was blocked by California attorney general Kamala Harris' refusal to provide prospective buyers with a release from liability. The company itself had doubled in revenue to $1.75billion during the period between 2007 and 2011 due to jobseekers going back to school to get new skills, according to the Los Angeles Times. It said Sunday it had been in 'advanced negotiations' with several parties to sell the 150-year-old college and allow outside partners to let Everest and WyoTech students continue their education but was unsuccessful. The institution sold many of its schools, though it failed to sell some after California Attorney General Kamala Harris (left) did not give buyers release from liability . Students at schools such as WyoTech (pictured) generated $1.2billion in government loans in Corinthian's final year, though they now face the prospect of high debt and possibly meaningless degrees . 'Unfortunately, the current regulatory environment would not allow us to complete a transaction with several interested parties that would have allowed for a seamless transition for our students,' Corinthian CEO Jack Massimino said in a statement. The company also defended its work, saying its graduation and job placement rates 'compared favorably with community colleges' and that many of its students hadn't been able to get their needs met at a traditional higher education institution. 'Neither our board of directors, our management, our faculty, nor our students believe these schools deserved to be forced to close,' Massimino said. A group of current and former Corinthian students are petitioning the Education Department to waive their federal student debt based on the alleged misconduct. Roughly 400 Corinthian students filed defense to repayment claims based on Corinthian having broken the law. According to the company's filings, the schools generated $1.2billion government loans its final year. Though the shutdown had been anticipated, Corinthian gave students, some of whom were scheduled to graduate in the coming months, no notice that its institutions would be closed on Monday. 'It was very shocking to be told 'hey, tomorrow, no more school,' Alexandra Roske, a student and single mother at Heald College in Salida, California, with $18,000 of student loan debt told KCRA. Transferring credits may be difficult, especially given the reputation that the credits from Corinthian - and graduate's degrees from the institution - have taken on in light of their school's misdeeds. Some have questioned why government officials allowed students to continue to enroll at the schools with their shutdown imminent. California regulators ordered the schools to stop taking on new students earlier this month after Corinthian could not produce the required financial papers. The state's Department of Consumer Affairs will be holding meetings at some of the closed schools.","For-profit school closing after being fined $30million by Dept of Education .

"A young yoga student is among nearly 40 Britons who are currently missing in Nepal in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake which has killed 4,000 people. Susannah Ross, 20, told friends she was going trekking last week but has not been heard from since Friday and may be unable to contact her loved ones at home in Britain. While many of those initially reported missing have since been found safe and well, there are still several dozen British travellers who have not been heard from since the disaster on Saturday morning. Missing: Susannah Ross, pictured, is among the dozens of Britons currently in Nepal who have not been heard of since Saturday's earthquake . Couple: Chloe Pincho and Brennan White, pictured, were climbing Mount Everest when the earthquake hit two days ago . A number of Britons were climbing Mount Everest at the time of the quake, while others were staying in the capital Kathmandu or trekking through rural areas. Miss Ross's family said today that they had been unable to contact the backpacker since the disaster struck and were increasingly concerned about her. She had recently set off on a three-week trek and warned relatives at home in Bath they might not hear from her during that time, but they now hope she will call to let them know she is safe. Her mother Judy said: 'We are just waiting around really. We don't know what is going on. Before the trek she said, ""Don't expect to hear from me necessarily until I get back."" We are doing what we can.' The 20-year-old worked as a waitress to save money for her trip to Asia, where she worked at a farm in Nepal before going trekking. She was due to continue to India for a yoga course in June. Among the other Britons who have not been in contact with home since the 7.8 magnitude earthquake are a middle-aged married couple. Barbara and Ian Nightingale, who are from Nottingham and in their 60s, were believed to be trekking in Nepal at the time of the quake. Appeal: Tom Southgate, left, and Samuel Beckett, right, have not been heard of since the disaster . Search: Matt Carapiet, left, and Jack Kilpatrick, right, are currently the subject of online appeals from their desperate families . Fears are growing over Julius Olatokunbo, 53, from Forest Hill in south-east London, after a climber wrote online that he had been 'taken with an avalanche' and separated from his group. Relatives of Samuel Beckett, 23, who was in Kathmandu at the time of the quake, say they are concerned because they have not heard from him in a week. Speaking from his home in Leicester, his father Martin said: 'We have not heard anything. He is still listed as missing. We just keep watching the news and keep looking through the social media sites.' A couple from Carshalton in Surrey, Chloe Pincho and Brennan White, were trekking up Mount Everest at the time of the disaster and their whereabouts is now unknown. The parents of Matt Carapiet, 23, from Kent made an online appeal for him to contact them after he went missing in the wake of the crisis. Abroad: Martin Gattuso, left, lives in Nepal where he is a Buddhist monk; Jake Whyles, right, was visiting the mountainous country . 41-year-old Scottish woman Seobhan McGuigan and Jack Young, 21, from Lincolnshire are two more Britons to be on the list of the missing. 59-year-old Janet Brownlie and Jack Kilpatrick, 24, from Teddington in Middlesex, are also out of contact. Judith Ridgewell, who is in her 40s and from Cornwall, has gone missing on her travels, and Jake Whyles, 24, from Lincolnshire is also out of contact. Gary Williams, 52, from Plymouth was last heard from on Friday night, when he sent an email to his relatives while trekking in Nepal. Norah Arscott, 77, from Somerset; Philip Green, 30, from London; and Shaun Bailey, 27, from Stoke-on-Trent are all reported as missing. 24-year-old Naomi Everett, from Cheshire, is also on the Red Cross list of the missing, along with Lloyd Davies, 22, from Beckenham. Rescue: The scene at Everest base camp after the earthquake killed a number of climbers on the world's tallest mountain . Carnage: A building in Bhaktapur, near Kathmandu, which was almost completely destroyed by the natural disaster . Another missing teenager is Annette Burd, 18, from Leicestershire, while relatives of Tom Southgate, 23, are anxiously waiting to hear from him in Nottingham and Heather Stretton, 47, from Lincolnshire is also missing. Richard Jones, 33, from Worcestershire went missing while trekking in Annapurna; Victoria Barkas, 34, and Ian Norquay, from Sussex have also been in the area. Also missing are two Britons who have moved to South Asia - Simon Charlesworth, 49, and Buddhist monk Martin Gattuso, 38, originally from Norfolk. Around 10 British-born expats living in Australia are currently being sought. A number of other British travellers were initially reported missing but were able to contact their families within a day or two. These included Sebastian Lovera, 22, who was hiking to Mount Everest at the time of the earthquake but has now returned to Kathmandu to help victims of the disaster.

"A terminally-ill landlord whose dying wish was to marry his partner of 26 years saw their special day descend into farce after a series of blunders. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and the pair settled on a venue close to their home. But, instead of having the magical day they had planned, the couple were left reeling after a number of bungles thwarted the ceremony from running smoothly. Guests were forced to listen to the wedding song 10 times while it played over and over, and the couple were left with three marriage certificates after officials got crucial details wrong on the first two. Geoff Haigh, 61, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, wanted to marry his long-term partner Heather, 54, after being diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer but the couple's special day (pictured) was full of blunders . Guests at the couple's (pictured) wedding were forced to listen to the song 'Wonderful Life' 10 times in a row due to a blunder and their marriage certificate was recorded with the wrong date on, rendering it invalid . Mr Haigh, who died weeks after the ceremony in November last year, was left so devastated by the day that he told his wife that he felt like he'd let her down. In fact, the day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House in the city centre, where the pair said their vows. Mrs Haigh, 54, said: 'Geoff was heartbroken by it all. He kept apologising to me and saying he'd wished we'd got married years earlier and done it properly. 'He was devastated, as the way he saw it, this was his final gesture for me and it had been ruined by their thoughtlessness.' The couple had initially dreamed of getting married abroad once Mr Haigh discovered his advanced pancreatic cancer was terminal. However, the landlord of The Ram's Head pub, in Oldham, was distraught to discover that his tumour was too large for him to fly safely. The pair then settled upon the Manchester venue as it was not too far from their home. It took three people two hours to get Mr Haigh ready for his big day and, determined to make the day perfect for his bride-to-be, he battled through pain to make it to the venue. Mrs Haigh, 54, said every guest at the ceremony -  held in November last year in Manchester  -  wrote a letter of complaint. She has three marriage certificates (pictured) as the first two were riddled with errors . The couple had an examiner testing the registrar doing their ceremony (pictured) and were given an invalid marriage certificate as it featured the wrong date. An amended version posted later was full spelling errors . However, it was upon their arrival at the venue that the catalogue of errors began. They said they found the register office dirty and claimed they were forced to wipe dirt from the seats before they sat down. Then they noticed a woman sat at the back as they said their vows, which turned out to be an examiner testing the registrar. Mrs Haigh, a mother of three, said: 'There was some random woman sat at the back who none of us knew and it was only after I asked I was told she was assessing the registrar to see how she did on the day. Geoff Haigh and his wife Heather endured a catalogue of blunders during their wedding day. 'It felt like they were merely using us a practice go, like our special day was not the real thing or of any importance to them.' After the bride and groom said their vows, guests were left on their own to the sound of their bridal music 'Wonderful Life' while the registrar went out of the room. Unbelievably, almost half an hour passed before she returned and the song played 10 times over before Mrs Haigh was compelled to take action. She said: 'Everyone was groaning when the song kept coming back on. We couldn't believe it. 'It had been a special song for us but it is definitely tainted by that day now.' After the ceremony, as they went off to enjoy their wedding reception at city centre restaurant San Carlos, the couple were informed that they would have to return to the register office as officials had logged the wrong date on their marriage certificate. They were instructed to go back to the venue to have the gaffe corrected, otherwise their marriage was invalid. Mrs Haigh told officials that her husband was too ill and could barely walk so they would have to post the amended certificate instead. However, when the second certificate arrived in the post, it was addressed to Mrs Haigh in her maiden name 'Taylor' and included spelling errors on the document. A third certificate then had to be posted out to the couple. Mr Haigh (above) passed away in January this year, just weeks after his wedding to long-term partner Heather. The couple decided they wanted to get married when he was diagnosed as terminal late last year . Mrs Haigh (left) said her new husband (right) was left devastated by the series of blunders and said he felt like he had let her down. She has received £137 from the Manchester register office following the calamity day . Mrs Haigh said: 'It felt like they didn't recognise we were married and that really hurt Geoff before he died. 'It made if feel like the whole thing didn't happen, like it meant nothing at all. It was devastating. 'The guests were all in tears for us. They were all absolutely disgusted and no one could believe the day could have gone so atrociously.' The newlyweds were offered a £137 refund but Mrs Haigh said they were told by the register office that there was not a significant enough 'loss' to warrant compensation. She said: 'It wasn't about the money, but to say there was no loss ignores the emotional cost it took on my husband. 'It was the arrogance and flippant attitude that hurt even more. They said ""we all make mistakes and we are only human"". 'That's fine when you make mistakes in a restaurant with someone's food but when you are dealing with a terminally ill man's dying wish and the most special day of our lives, that attitude is not acceptable.' The wedding day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to Manchester Register Office, which is based at Heron House (pictured)  in the city centre, where the pair said their vows . The family has since received an apology from Manchester City Council, which runs the register office based at Heron House. A spokesman said: 'I'd like to offer our sincerest apologies to Mrs Taylor as the ceremony did not meet her expectations. 'These types of problems are thankfully exceptionally rare and our registry staff are incredibly conscientious. They understand that they play a vital role in the most important day of a couple's life and would never knowingly do anything to spoil or delay a wedding.' However, tragically, Mr Haigh died on January 4 this year before receiving the apology. His wife added: 'Geoff was determined not to die over Christmas because he said it would ruin it for everyone after he was gone for years to come, and he didn't want that for us. The energy it took from him to hang on, I couldn't believe.'","Geoff Haigh, 61, wanted to marry partner Heather after cancer diagnosis .

"The arrival of an advanced group of modern humans in Europe 40,000 years ago played a role in the demise of Neanderthals, scientists have claimed. Neanderthals were the dominant human species in Europe and much of Asia for around 250,000 years before vanishing entirely 41,000 years ago. Now scientists have found proof that a group of modern humans known as the Protoaurignacian culture arrived in southern Europe at around the same time the Neanderthals disappeared. Scientists took CT scans of teeth found at Riparo Bombrini in western Ligurian Alps (left) and in the Grotta di Fumane in western Lessini Mountains (right), both in Italy, and found they belonged to ancestors of modern humans who were part of a group known as the Protoaurignacian culture . They have been able to conclusively show that a pair of ancient baby teeth found at two prehistoric sites in northern Italy belong to modern humans from this culture. It has settled a debate that has raged since they were discovered in 1976, and later in 1992, over whether the teeth and other artefacts found with them were Neanderthal or Homo sapien in origin. An incisor found in Riparo Bombrini in western Ligurian Alps in 1976, and an upper incisor found in 1992, in the Grotta di Fumane in the western Lessini Mountains in Italy are among only three remains thought to have belonged to the Protoaurignacian culture - an early group of humans. Dr Benazzi and his colleagues at the CNR Institute of Clinical Physiology in Pisa, Italy, whose work is published in the journal Science, used CT scans of a tooth found in Riparo Bombrini. They found that the enamel on the crown of the teeth was thicker than that found on Neanderthal teeth and it was more similar in morphology to modern humans. Radio carbon dating also showed that it was 40,000 years old. Using advanced scanning and DNA analysis, researchers have now been able to prove that these teeth belonged to Protoaurignacian humans and are the oldest modern human remains in Europe. They suggest it was the arrival of this modern human culture that marked a turning point in humanity’s evolution and led to the rapid disappearance of Neanderthals in the face of their more advanced cousins. The Aurignacian culture that followed the arrival of these first modern humans produced the world’s earliest known musical instruments and the oldest wall art. They also produced advanced bone and antler based weapons, and are thought to have been behind a 40,000-year-old sculpture known as the Lion Man. Dr Stefano Benazzi, an archaeologist at the University of Bologna in Italy said: ‘What the results mean is that these two teeth represent the oldest European modern human fossils currently associated with an Aurignacian-related archaeological context. ‘Human fossil material is very rare, particularly well preserved deciduous teeth. ‘This finding suggests that the arrival of our species on the continent might have triggered the demise of Neanderthals, which likely disappeared around 39,000 years ago.’ There are very few archaeological remains of the Protoaurignacian culture from when they arrived in Europe. The baby teeth, found at two sites in north Italy shown above, are two of just three Protoaurignacian remains . Using advanced scanning and DNA analysis, researchers have proved the teeth belonged to this culture and that they are the oldest modern human remains in Europe. They suggest it was the arrival of this modern human culture (infant skull pictured left) led to the rapid disappearance of Neanderthals (skull pictured right) This fragment bird bone was engraved by inhabitants of a rock shelter  at Riparo Bombrini in north west Italy and is now known to have been made by the first modern humans in Europe who arrived 40,000 years ago . CT scans of the incisor found at Riparo Bombrini (above) showed it had thicker enamel than Neanderthal teeth and it was more similar in morphology to modern humans. Radio carbon dating also showed that it was 40,000 years old . An incisor found in Riparo Bombrini in western Ligurian Alps in 1976, and an upper incisor found in 1992, in the Grotta di Fumane in the western Lessini Mountains in Italy were among only three remains that  thought to have belonged to this early group of humans. They are often depicted as dim-witted evolutionary losers, but Neanderthals were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains. Instead, it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors, scientists believe. An analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years strips away some of the myths surrounding Neanderthals and reveals they were more advanced and sophisticated than has widely been thought. Many researchers believe the differences between the two human species are not enough on their own to account for the demise of the Neanderthals. Neanderthals have been found to make stone tools and even made jewellery. Eight talons taken from a white-tailed eagle found at Neanderthal site in Krapina in Croatia were used to create a necklace or bracelet 130,000 years ago. They were found alongside a series of stone blades that had been made using advanced knapping techniques, other tools and simple ornaments. However, it has also been suggested that the teeth may have belonged belonged to Neanderthals, meaning they had also been capable of this advanced technology. Dr Benazzi and his colleagues at the CNR Institute of Clinical Physiology in Pisa, Italy, whose work is published in the journal Science, used CT scans of a tooth found in Riparo Bombrini. They found that the enamel on the crown of the teeth was thicker than that found on Neanderthal teeth and it was more similar in morphology to modern humans. Radio carbon dating also showed that it was 40,000 years old. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology also managed to extract mitochondrial DNA from the tooth found at Grotta di Fumane. They found it matched that of pre-agricultural modern humans. The researchers say that the findings prove that by 41,000 years ago modern humans of the Protoaurignacian culture were spreading across southern Europe. They believe that the advanced culture of these modern humans allowed them to outcompete and perhaps even overpower the Neanderthals who were established there. However, their results cannot exclude the possibility that the teeth came from individuals who were the result of interbreeding between Neanderthals and modern humans. Previous research has shown that the two species did interbreed and some researchers have suggested Neanderthals became absorbed into modern human populations. One of the teeth was found during an excavation of the Grotta di Fumane in northern Italy (shown above). The samples were found alongside a series of stone blades that had been made using advanced knapping techniques, other tools and simple ornaments . Evidence uncovered at the Riparo Bombrini rock shelter (above) suggests those who were living there 40,000 years ago had relatively advanced culture and technologies and so may have out competed Neanderthals .","Two incisors found in northern Italy have been confirmed to belong to modern humans who were part of the Protoaurignacian culture in Europe .

"Judges rejected Home Secretary Theresa May's attempt to deport the 53-year-old serial criminal because of the risk of 'unacceptably savage' abuse he faced in Libya . A Libyan convicted of 78 offences cannot be deported from Britain because he is an alcoholic. Seven years after the man was first told he would be booted out of the country, a judge has finally ruled that it would breach his human rights. In what is thought to be an unprecedented case, he successfully argued he would be tortured and imprisoned by the authorities in his homeland because drinking alcohol is illegal. Judges rejected Home Secretary Theresa May's attempt to deport the 53-year-old serial criminal because of the risk of 'unacceptably savage' abuse he faced in Libya. It means he will be able to continue his drink-fuelled offending spree in Britain. His case is estimated to have cost British taxpayers a six-figure sum, including the cost of police time, legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts and the costs of keeping him in prison. The case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws. Last night Peter Bone, Tory candidate for Wellingborough, said the case illustrated why Britain should scrap the Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. 'This kind of things drives people mad,' he said. 'On the doorstep they find cases like this outrageous. Few people will think this man should remain in the country. He has completely abused our hospitality.' Despite insisting the Libyan had 'behaved disgracefully' to rack up 78 crimes on 52 occasions, the Upper Immigration Tribunal said deporting him would violate the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act. It found that removing him would breach Article 3, the right to avoid inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, and Article 8, the right to a private or family life. In a written ruling, Judge Jonathan Perkins said: 'Under the rule of militia [in Libya] the usual routine for a person found drinking was arrest, possible whipping and detention for a few days.' Expert witnesses had claimed that there was 'a chance of virtually permanent detention in the case of an habitual drunk'. He he successfully argued he would be tortured and imprisoned by the authorities in his homeland because drinking alcohol is illegal . Belal Ballali, a British-Libyan researcher, said 'commercially produced alcohol is widely available in Tripoli' and 'cheaply made 'moonshine' is readily available and cheap to buy outside the capital'. The man, who was granted anonymity by the courts and can only be identified by the initials 'HU', came to Britain in 1981 to study engineering. Apart from a short period in Libya from August 1993 to October 1994, he has remained here ever since. He had spent 'many years' trying to deal with his alcohol dependency. During that time he had been imprisoned for a string of offences 'largely and possibly exclusively as a consequence of his alcoholism', the judge ruled. No details of his crimes were given but none of them involved sexual assault, violence or other serious law-breaking. In July 2008, after giving him five warnings, the Home Office told 'HU' he would be deported, but he appealed and won on the grounds that it would breach his human rights. He continued to offend and a new deportation order was issued in January 2013. An immigration court overturned that and yesterday it emerged that the department's appeal had failed.","Judge ruled deporting Libyan alcoholic would breach his human rights .

'It's a modern and fresh color not previously seen on state chinas, but Mrs. Obama's main goal was to create a modern service that is completely compatible and interchangeable and usable with all the historic china services,' White House Curator William Allman said during a preview of Tuesday's state dinner. A fluted band of Kailua Blue, framed by a textured gold rim and a simple gold inner line, appears on all pieces of the service, except the dinner and serving plates. The solid white dinner plates are edged in gold; the service plates have a wide gold rim and the presidential coat of arms at the center. The china, which has settings for 320 people, cost approximately $367,000. It was paid for from a private fund that is administered by the White House Historical Association and used to acquire fine and decorative arts for the presidential mansion. The state china service then-first lady Laura Bush unveiled in January 2009 cost $493,000. It was being unveiled Monday during a preview for Tuesday's state dinner for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 'If you've seen our state dinners, we really do a lot of mixing and matching — sometimes because we really do not have enough, sometimes because we're trying to create a new modern, different, edgy kind of look,' Mrs. Obama told Architectural Digest last week when she previewed the Obama state china for interior design journalists and bloggers.

Long process: Three years ago, in the spring of 2012, Pickard China, of Antioch, Illinois, was brought in to consult on the project. The company has made dinnerware for use at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland and aboard Air Force One . The Obama state china service was paid for with money from a private fund that is used to buy fine and decorative arts for the White House and is administered by the White House Historical Association. The cost was not disclosed. There is no requirement for presidents to have a state china service and some, including Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, had none. Planning began in the fall of 2011 when Mrs. Obama and family friend and designer Michael Smith began gathering feedback from members of the White House residence staff. Three years ago, in the spring of 2012, Pickard China, of Antioch, Illinois, was brought in to consult on the project. The company has made dinnerware for use at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland and aboard Air Force One. Mrs. Obama wanted the state china service to have modern elements but also be practical, said the White House, which was unveiling it earlier than recent administrations. Each setting includes a first for presidential tableware — an individual tureen that can be used for soup, dessert or 'any other dish that the chefs get creative and decide they would like to serve with a little panache in an individual serving size,' Allman said.

"A mother whose son suffers an incredibly rare disease, which makes his skin appear scalded, was shocked after a stranger reported her to police for child abuse. Four-year-old RJ Jackson is one of just 70 people in the world who suffers Netherton's syndrome. His skin appears red and inflamed, and is often covered in dry skin that appears like scales on his body. His mother Valerie Jackson has to regularly cover him in creams to try and prevent his skin drying out. But while out shopping recently, Mrs Jackson was suddenly surrounded by armed police, who had been called by a member of the public. Valerie Jackson, pictured left with her son RJ when he was three months old, was accused of scalding her son after a member of the public mistook his rare skin disease for the signs of abuse. RJ, pictured recently right, suffers Netherton's syndrome, an incredibly rare illness which causes his skin to appear red and scaly . As soon as RJ was born, Mrs Jackson, from Las Vegas, knew there was something wrong with her son, after noticing a red rash spreading across his tiny chest . They reported fears Mrs Jackson had been abusing RJ. 'It just shows the extent of people's ignorance,' Mrs Jackson, from Las Vegas, said. The 35-year-old said she is also subjected to taunts in the street, with other mother's accusing her of burning RJ. 'His skin is bright red and shiny,' Mrs Jackson added. 'I put Vaseline all over him two to three times a day to keep his skin subtle but he is still sore. 'When he was younger he had to have it over his body every few hours – even in the night. 'We haven't known sleep for about five years.' The mother-of-four said her young son is also targeted by bullies - many cruel taunts being made by adults. 'One woman came up to me and thought he was badly burnt,' she said. 'She said sharply to me, ""Excuse me, your child has caught the sun"". 'I couldn't believe it. But we're used to the staring and ignorant comments. 'I think he is the most beautiful boy in the world. 'He's got a cheeky smile and an adorable giggle.' She said RJ has been treated like an outcast because of his illness, a rare congenital skin disease, which makes skin red and scaly. Mrs Jackson and her husband, Reginald, 40, have to regularly cover RJ's body with creams to  ease his painful symptoms. But she said, both she and her son face cruel taunts from bullies, most of whom are adults . While out shopping with RJ, Mrs Jackson, pictured left with her son in hospital, was suddenly surrounded by armed police. A member of the pubic had called officers reporting the 35-year-old for child abuse . 'It just shows the extent of people's ignorance,' Mrs Jackson said. She said her son has been treated as an outcast, having been denied entry to play centres and facing cruel jibes from people in the street . 'We were denied entry to an indoor playhouse because of his skin,' she said. 'We've had the police called for child abuse. 'We were in Walmart in Las Vegas putting his creams on when we were surrounded by five armed police. Netherton's syndrome is a rare congenital skin disease - a more extreme form of ichthyosis. Sufferers' skin appears red and scaly and can also experience hair, infection and allergy problems. Because red skin can be attributed to several diseases, the condition may not be accurately diagnosed until later in a child's life. Most children with the disease appeared 'scalded' at birth and are slow to gain weight. Their skin quickly loses heat, water and protein and babies are often kept in incubators on special care baby units as a result. They are more at risk of infection because of their inflammed skin. Parents are advised to reguarly cleanse and moisturiser their child'skin, while taking care when holding them. There is no cure for the condition, but in most infants, the symptoms improve with time. As they get older, a child's skin may remain red and scaly, and their skin may be itchy, sensitive or raw, sometimes appearing thicker at the joints. The condition appears out of the blue where there has been no family history. But, it is thought to be genetic, and parents can carry the faulty gene responsible. Source: Ichthyosis Support Group . 'Their guns weren't drawn. The officer asked what was going on. I explained and he apologised. 'But it just shows the extent of people's ignorance.' Mrs Jackson, who is married to RJ's father Reginald, 40, said their son was diagnosed when he was a baby. 'After an emergency caesarean, I knew something wasn't right,' she said. 'As RJ was lifted up and I saw him for the first time, I noticed an angry rash on his chest. 'He was rushed to intensive care where the rash seemed to spread before our eyes, his skin becoming even redder and cracking.' She said her first thought was he was being burnt by the incubator light. 'But he wasn't,' she said. 'No one had any idea what was wrong with him. 'When doctors told me I could take him home two weeks later, I burst into tears. 'I didn't think he was well enough to leave hospital. His skin was crusty and starting to fall off. 'Back home, as he cried and screamed, I felt helpless, and wished there was something I could do. 'He'd scratch at his skin until it bled, so I put socks on his hands to stop him. 'I searched the internet for answers but I couldn't find anything.' She eventually stumbled upon a Facebook group called Netherton's Syndrome Research Group. It had been set up by a couple in the UK whose child,Jack Oldacres has the condition. 'Each symptom was exactly like RJ's,' Mrs Jackson said. 'People from all over the world were sharing stories, swapping tips to help one another. 'I knew this was what he had. I found out Netherton's was a rare strain of the skin condition ichthyosis, affecting one in 200,000 births in the UK. Mrs Jackson was desperate to discover what was wrong with RJ, centre on his sister's lap, and so turned to the internet. There, she found a Facebook group set up by the parents of a little boy with the disease. 'Each symptom was exactly like RJ's,' she said. 'I knew this was what he had' 'Reginald and I started slathering RJ's skin in Vaseline every three hours, like people on the group suggested. 'We bathed him just twice a week because the hard water dried out his skin too much. 'Each time I'd sit with him in the bath and painstakingly remove all the dead skin.' But, she said, people are still critical of her. 'I'm happy to explain what Netherton's is, but most people jump to conclusions before I get the chance,' she said. 'His brother and sisters are great with him, always helping out and standing up for him. 'Just like any other little boy, he loves throwing around a ball and is usually bubbly and happy, until his skin starts to hurt. 'Right now, RJ is too young to know that people make nasty comments, but I hope as he grows, his condition will be better known. 'It doesn't matter how red his skin is, all I see is a beautiful little boy.'","RJ Jackson is one of around 70 sufferers of Netherton's syndrome .

"CNN's Dr Sanjay Gupta has abandoned his journalistic duties to scrub up and perform brain surgery on a teenager in an overstretched hospital in Nepal. The neurosurgeon, who is in Kathmandu to cover the aftermath of Saturday's deadly earthquake, performed a craniotomy on the 15-year-old girl, Sandhya Chalise, after a wall of her family's home fell on her as she collected water outside. Sandhya, who lives in a more remote area of the country, only reached Kathmandu's Bir Hospital two days after the 7.8-magnitude quake and by that point, blood had collected in the top of her brain, CNN reported. Scroll down for video . Put to work: Dr Sanjay Gupta (second left), the chief medical correspondent for CNN, was asked by a Nepalese hospital to perform brain surgery on a 15-year-girl who was injured in the earthquake . Quick-thinking: Gupta, center at the hospital, said the girl was just one of many people walking through the doors with head injuries at the overstretched hospital. More than 6,000 people were injured . 'I was asked to do this by the doctors there at the hospital,' Dr Gupta said during a telephone interview with the network. 'I think they literally need another set of hands because the demand is so high.' During the procedure, he was forced to used basic equipment, such as a saw rather than an electric drill, and sterile water and iodine from a bottle, rather than a proper scrub sink, he told CNN. Following the operation, she is 'doing well', Gupta said, 'but her story is unfortunately very typical'. After the surgery, an eight-year-old girl arrived at the hospital needing a similar operation. More than 4,300 people are believed to have been killed in the earthquake, but Nepalese officials have speculated that as many as 10,000 could have died. Around 6,000 have been injured and are pouring into the hospitals, which are struggling to keep up with the demand. 'I've seen a lot of situations around the world, and this is as bad as I've ever seen it,' Gupta said. Hurt: Another child with a similar head injury, pictured, came to the hospital shortly after the operation . Helping hand: As well as working for CNN, Gupta is a neurosurgeon at Emory Healthcare in Atlanta . 'They need more resources, they need more personnel here right now, and they're expecting many more patients as these rescue operations go on. They're barely able to keep up right now.' As well as serving as CNN's chief medical correspondent, Gupta is a neurosurgeon at Emory Healthcare in Atlanta. It is not the first time the married father-of-three, 45, has performed surgery while on a reporting job. In 2003, while covering the medical demands of the invasion of Iraq, he performed emergency surgery on U.S. soldiers and Iraqi civilians. And while reporting in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, he and other doctors removed a piece of concrete from a 12-year-old girl's skull aboard aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.

"When leaving a place of work, most people will usually avoid burning  bridges. Engineering an amicable exit is common protocol, even when the employee can't wait to get the hell out of there. But one disgruntled staff member at an anonymous firm decided to skip the pleasantries and pen an incredibly sarcastic resignation letter announcing their impending departure to bosses. A Reddit user wrote an incredibly sarcastic resignation letter to their boss . A Reddit user decided that it was a good idea to write a biting leaving note to their boss.It's not known exactly where the letter is from, but the writer is believed to be America since the American spelling of ‘apologize’ is used and the date is 4/24/15 which is the U.S. way of writing it. In the note, the Reddit user passive-aggressively vents their frustration and discontent with the company policies as well as the lack of emopion shown during recent events. Throughout the letter, the Reddit user repeatedly apologises for a number of unfortunate incidents - all of which seem to be out of their control. They apologise for the death of a step-mother, sickness and  subsequent doctor's appointments. The letter reads: 'I am sorry that my step-mother died so suddenly from cancer. I am sorry that I am not a robot and was emotionally affected by her passing and had to miss work. 'I am sorry that I got sick and had to miss work so that I didn't get anyone else sick. 'I am sorry I work 47.5 hours per week (without getting paid the overtime that I am legally owed) for the last 7 months, and thus have little choice but to schedule necessary doctor's appointments during school hours.' 'Clearly I am a terrible employee, and for that I apologize. I know you hate people telling you how to do your job, but I suggest you start looking for my replacement. Immediately.' Although posted with the caption 'two weeks notice', the defiant ending of the letter hints at a rather more immediate departure.","A Reddit user handed in their notice by writing sarcastic letter .

"A sickening propaganda image linked to the Islamic State terrorist group has surfaced showing a newborn baby sleeping next to a grenade, a handgun and what appears to be a birth certificate. The image, which has not been verified,  was re-posted to Twitter on Sunday by an anti-ISIS activist in Syria with the warning:  'This child will be risk to you not just to us'. Abu Ward Al-Raqqawi, a self proclaimed 'founder of the Syrian revolution,' believes the chilling image was released to radicalise the next generation of jihadis. Terror experts have revealed to Daily Mail Australia the snapshot is a showcase of the groups supposed longevity, as well as a compelling window into life within their self-declared caliphate. Scroll down for video . The sickening image of a newborn baby pictured next to a handgun, grenade and Islamic State birth certificate . The post says the newborn child is called ‘Jrah’, while its mothers name is ‘Om’ and its fathers name is ‘Abu.’ It also claims the certificate next to the baby is an 'ISIS issued ID for a child.' The image was believed to be posted by Abu Ward Al-Raqqawi in the hope of garnering attention to the international threat posed by ISIS. The image has yet to be verified but it bears strong similarities to earlier ISIS propaganda. Last September, a harrowing image was released by the group of a baby dressed as a fighter lying on an Islamic state flag beside grenades and enormous automatic firearms. In August, notorious Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf posted a Twitter image of his seven-year-old son gripping the severed head of a Syrian soldier, with the accompanying caption 'that's my boy!' The chilling snapshot was re-posted by anti-Islamic State activists in hopes of garnering international attention to the threat posed by the depraved militant group . The image bears a strong resemblance to earlier ISIS propaganda, such as this image of a baby lying on an ISIS flag surrounded by weapons . Australian National University terrorism expert Dr Clarke Jones told Daily Mail Australia the image appears to be authentic. ‘By showing the birth certificate, and the fact that the group are indoctrinating babies, I think ISIS are indicating they will be around for a long time.’ ‘It’s an interesting signal of life within the caliphate. Obviously by posting opposition to the Islamic State from within their borders the activist is operating with great risk.’ Jones said the post could be an international plea for military intervention on account of the rapid deterioration of life in Raqqa, the stronghold of the Islamic State. In August, notorious Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf released this image of his seven-year-old son  holding a severed head . ISIS has made it a policy to groom children to take part in jihad, brainwashing them from a very young age. Online propaganda is an integral part of this process, with the group using scores of social media accounts to disseminate their messages to youths around the world. In February, Australia's Attorney-General George Brandis announced an $18 million initiative to battle extremist propaganda in Australia. The operation, which will be launched in July, will employ a team of technology experts to assess the impact of extremist propaganda. The government also plans to seek the help of platforms such as Google, Twitter and Facebook, to counter extremist messages.

"Sophie Wilson performed CPR on Bradley Wilson . A teenage girl has told how she  saved the life of a childhood friend who attempted suicide after months of bullying. Sophie Wilson, 17, performed CPR on Bradley Parkes after she and a friend found him hanging from a tree in the woods near his home in Willenhall, in Coventry. The 16-year-old was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital in a coma but yesterday his mother Tiffany, 35, revealed he had made a 'miracle' recovery, as she thanked the girls. Sophie and Katie Alwill, 18, raised the alarm and summoned help after they stumbled across the teenager during a woodland walk . 'Someone burned the rope free from the tree using a lighter,' said Miss Wilson. 'He wasn't breathing and his pulse was very weak. 'I learned CPR at school and I started doing chest compressions and mouth to mouth. 'He started breathing again but it was more snorting than breathing. 'I'm in shock and it still hasn't hit me that this actually happened. It feels like it isn't real.' Miss Wilson revealed how Bradley had grown up in the house opposite her and they went to primary school together. 'He's a really nice lad and I've never heard a bad word said about him. I didn't know he was being bullied. I don't think he told anyone.' Ms Parkes, a mother-of-five, told yesterday how her son was making progress. 'I can't thank those girls enough, I dread to think what would have happened if they hadn't found him,' she reportedly told the Mirror. The mother of schoolboy Bradley Parkes, 16, shared this picture saying: 'Hope all you b******s are happy my son is fighting for his life' after his suicide attempt . 'I thought he was going to die.' The mother-of-five shared a picture of her son in hospital last week and said he had been tormented for months by a gang. She described how her son had been robbed at knife point several times and was even slashed in the face. 'It all started in about August last year and Bradley has even been held at knifepoint,' she told the Coventry Telegraph. 'One time he was walking from one friend's house to another and this gang robbed all three of them. 'They even cut his face with a knife and told him not to tell people. He's even had his hand broken. 'Every time they see him they just take everything off him. People know all about this gang and they are arrested for all sorts.' The Manchester United fan was found unconscious in Willenhall Woods on Thursday last week. He had just passed his first course at Ernesford Grange School and was planning to go to college. His mother previously said: 'He left a suicide note saying he was taking his own life as it was easier than what he was going through.' Ms Parkes said the bullying escalated after Bradley gave a statement to the police about the gang, who are aged between 14 and 18. 'He's been called a grass and all sorts,' she said. Bradley was discovered hanging in the woods with a suicide note saying taking his own life was easier than what he was going through. He is now recovering from the ordeal . 'When he was held at knifepoint we decided enough was enough and went to the police. 'The other boy who was also robbed was too scared to make a statement, but Bradley wanted to. 'One of the gang members was charged and is now on remand in prison. He's up in court next month. 'They have smashed people's windows, vandalised people's homes and even set fire to someone using a deodorant can and a lighter. 'It left the person with burns on their stomach. Since that, all the grass stuff started and it made Bradley's life hell.' She slammed West Midlands Police for failing to take her repeated complaints seriously. 'I have gone to the police lots of times but it doesn't do anything. And not many people do go to the police as they are scared. I'm running out of options,' she said. West Midlands Police said they had launched and investigation into Bradley's attempt to end his life. Detective Chief Inspector Helen Kirkman said:'We recognise this is an emotive time for the school and the community. 'We are committed to finding out what may have led up to the boy taking such a sad decision and we continue to investigate offences that may have been committed against him. 'Anyone who may have any information that may assist our investigation should call us. 'Additional patrols are being carried out in the Willenhall area and we are working very closely with the school.'

"The U.S. and her allies are at an ever growing risk of a systemic cyber-assault, with energy infrastructure likely to be hacker's prime target. The stark warning comes from General Keith Alexander, the retired four-star general and former chief of the National Security Agency. 'The greatest risk is a catastrophic attack on the energy infrastructure. We are not prepared for that,' he warned. Scroll down for video . Former NSA chief General Keith Alexander has warned that the U.S. and her allies are at an ever growing risk of a systemic cyber-assault, with energy infrastructure likely to be hacker's prime target . Alexander, who led the U.S. battle against cyber-threats for much of the last decade, was speaking at a private dinner held by IHS CERAWeek in Texas last week, reports the Daily Telegraph. He envisioned a worst case-scenario where hackers targeted oil refineries, power stations, and the electric grid. The payments nexus of the major banks could also be paralysed he warned. 'We need something like an integrated air-defence system for the whole energy sector,' he said. Alexander listed five countries able to conduct cyber-warfare at the highest level: the US, UK, Israel, Russia and Iran. The current NSA chief Michael Rogers testified late last year that China is capable of cyber-attacks that could cause 'catastrophic failures' of the water system or the electricity grid. There is no suggestion that China has an intention to use its power to damage US infrastructure. NSA officials are less confident that Iran will show self-restraint. Alexander also voice his concern about the hacking threat from a terrorist organization such as ISIS. He said that the U.S. and her allies had failed to check the advance of ISIS and its expanding network of franchises across the Middle East.","General Keith Alexander has warned that the U.S. and her allies are at an ever growing risk of a systemic cyber-assault .

"Tragic: John Suchet (right) is in mourning after losing his wife Bonnie following her decade-long battle with dementia . Their relationship, he once said, was 'made in heaven'. Yesterday John Suchet was in mourning after losing his wife Bonnie following her decade-long battle with dementia. A death notice in a national newspaper read: 'Bonnie died peacefully on April 15 2015 aged 73. Adored wife of John, devoted mother of Alec and Hereward, mother-in-law of Peta-Jane, grandmother of Finn and Alexa.' The broadcaster declined to comment, stating it was a 'private family matter', but fans took to social networking site Twitter to offer their condolences. Classic FM presenter Suchet, now 71, has spoken openly about his wife's diagnosis and the toll it took on their relationship, writing a book and becoming honorary president of the Dementia UK charity. In an interview with the Daily Mail's Weekend magazine in September, Suchet appeared to confirm he was in a new relationship with a woman called Nula, who has featured in posts and holiday photographs he has shared on Twitter. Asked about the saddest time that shook his world, he replied: 'Watching my wife Bonnie suffer from dementia. Nula and I both have spouses in end-of-life care with dementia. They have no recognition, no bodily control, no dignity left, yet the priority is to keep them alive. We are kinder to animals. The Bonnie I remember no longer exists.' In 2009, he broke down on air on BBC Breakfast as he gave an account of his wife's battle. He told presenters she was unaware she had the illness, or that he was on TV talking about it. He added that he sometimes had to beat up a cushion to deal with his frustration at the loss of their relationship. He has also said in the past that he wished she had been diagnosed with cancer rather than dementia, adding: 'I cannot believe I'm saying these words but it will give you some idea of how cruel this illness is.' Bonnie Suchet (pictured with John) was described by her husband as 'the love of my life' Suchet began to notice a difference in his wife's behaviour in March 2004, and she was diagnosed with dementia in February 2006. In recent years Suchet, pictured with Bonnie (left) and (right) in 2013, has been extremely open about his wife's diagnosis, writing a book and becoming honorary president of the Dementia UK charity . For three years he cared for her by himself, keeping her condition secret from all but family and close friends. In one interview he admitted having 'suicidal moments', saying: 'There are times when I want to bury my head in my hands. When I persuade myself she would be better off without me.' Suchet was married with children when he and Bonnie – a glamorous American who reminded him of Grace Kelly – became neighbours in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. She was also married with children. But the pair were unable to resist their mutual attraction, and while Suchet was working as US correspondent for ITN, Bonnie flew out for a secret meeting with him and they made a pact to be together. His marriage broke up shortly afterwards and Bonnie left her husband. He was 39 and she was 42. He described her as 'the love of my life', saying: 'It was truly a grand passion. We had found each other. I never really thought of having an affair. We just wanted to be together for the rest of our lives and nothing was going to stop us. We shared everything.' In 2010, he revealed Bonnie had been moved to a residential home to be given better care, and described how he had been forced tell her they were going to a lovely hotel for the weekend. In 2009 Suchet was overcome as he told presenters how his wife had been unaware she had the illness, or that he was on TV talking about it . He said at the time: 'The worst thing about this wretched disease is that you behave as if the person has died. Yet I go and see her. She knows I am special and greets me with a hug and tears of joy. But does she know I am her husband? I am not going to ask. Does she know she has dementia? I don't know, and I'm not going to ask. 'She has never once asked the staff about me when I have gone. Again, that breaks my heart and makes me happy. Every emotion has a flip side with dementia.' Suchet had given up work to care for Bonnie when he was forced to put her into the residential home, and so was at a loss when a call came from Classic FM. He said: 'It could not have come at a better time in my life. I needed to be helped to move on. It's given me a reason to get up in the morning, it really has. 'The two important things are: what would Bon want for me? And secondly, if I give in and wallow, then dementia has another victim, hasn't it?'","Suchet, 71,  said his marriage to his Bonnie had been 'made in heaven'

"Controversial Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary claims the budget airline will slash its fares by as much as 15 per cent over the next two years. The chief executive of Europe’s largest budget airline made the vow in an interview with a French weekly newspaper, saying its average fare could be as low as €40 (approximately £26) next year. It would be a €6 (£4) decrease from Ryanair’s current average ticket price, with Mr O’Leary attributing the anticipated fare cuts to lower oil prices. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary took aim at Air France in his interview with Le Journal du Dimanche . Famed for his combative management style, Mr O’Leary told Le Journal du Dimanche the Dublin-based discount carrier will pass the oil savings on to customers and claimed most European airlines have an average ticket price of €170 for a short flight. He said Ryanair expects to grow its passenger numbers and cut costs with new Boeing aircraft that will have more seats and reduce fuel consumption by an average of 18 per cent – without compromising passenger safety or security. In his interview with the Sunday newspaper the airline boss, who has made strides to soften his image, took shots at Air France, touting Ryanair as a cheaper and more reliable airline. He ridiculed Air France for last year’s pilots’ strike, which reportedly cost the Paris-based carrier hundreds of millions of pounds, predicted more troubled times and accused the airline of impeding growth at regional airports. An Air France spokesperson told MailOnline Travel that the airline is not responding to Mr O'Leary's comments. Michael O'Leary said he despises the 'French political class', but loves France and the French . Mr O’Leary was put on the defensive several times in the wide-ranging interview, as he disputed claims that Ryanair staff face poor working conditions and wages. The chief executive claimed there is a waiting list of 300 pilots and nearly 1,000 flight attendants who want to work for Ryanair. He told the newspaper: ‘All the things we hear about Ryanair are nonsense. Many companies such as Air France cut jobs. We create, we increase salaries and we pay pension contributions.’ Mr O’Leary also had to explain his feelings towards the French, telling Le Journal du Dimanche that he ‘despises the French political class’ that ‘destroyed the economy’, but loves France and the French. The airline boss disputed claims that Ryanair staff face poor working conditions and wages . He defended Ryanair’s decision not to employ workers in France year-round, saying it is due to the ‘administrative madness’ of labour laws and taxation. Ryanair has long faced complaints of poor customer service and excessive surcharges, but recently launched a marketing push to win over customers and has eased some of its fees or restrictions. It operates 31 airports in France, and Mr O’Leary said its Paris hub will continue to be Beauvais-Tilly, about 55 miles north of the French capital. He said acquiring slots at Charles de Gaulle or Paris Orly airports – which are hubs for Air France-KLM and their subsidiaries – presents an expensive challenge.","Chief executive Michael O'Leary made the vow to a French newspaper .

"Ed Miliband lurched further to the Left yesterday with a land grab to extend state control over the property market. The Labour leader's 'Stalinist' plan to seize unused plots – as well as impose rent controls – shocked experts and investors. Property analysts said the move would take Britain back to the 'dark days of the Seventies'. Scroll down for video . Land-Grabber: Red Ed wants councils to encourage building by raising tax on unused land . Mr Miliband wants to bring in 'use it or lose it' powers allowing councils to encourage building by putting up taxes on undeveloped land. Sites still left idle could be compulsorily purchased for use by another developer. The announcement saw shares in housebuilders, including Barratt Developments, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey, fall by around 2 per cent before later recovering. The Institute of Directors describes the land grab as a 'Stalinist attack on property rights'. Last night a spokesman said: 'Developers do not generally sit on large amounts of land for long periods. Talking about compulsory purchasing is very difficult – who makes the decisions? 'We don't think that a series of interventions on the demand side of the housing market are particularly helpful when the problem is we are not building enough houses.' Pointing the way: Mr Miliband wants to bring in 'use it or lose it' powers for councils . Andrew Percy, Tory candidate for Brigg and Goole, said: 'It is the sort of policy you might expect from Soviet Russia. 'We should encourage developers to use this land, but threatening to steal people's land is using a stick rather than a carrot.' Mr Miliband's plan to link rents to inflation under new, three-year contracts came under fire too. Alan Ward, of the Residential Landlords Association, said Margaret Thatcher's abolition of rent controls in 1988 had doubled the number of homes on the lettings market. 'Labour's plans would take use back to the dark days of the Seventies and the Eighties which caused a shortage of decent homes to rent,' he added. Melanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, said: 'In places like London tenants will find this policy on rents may make their budgeting harder, rather than easier. 'Their rent will tick along at CPI inflation for a couple of years and then they will face a potential sharp rise in year three when the rent returns to market. 'Ultimately what will help tenants best is more investment in housing. 'Pension funds and other institutions have billions to invest in this market – developing places that would provide a new generation of high-quality homes that offer greater choice to renters, including the option to sign longer tenancies.' In it together: Mr Miliband said the pledge to cut stamp duty to zero over the next three years would benefit nine out of ten people buying their first home . Richard Lambert, of the National Landlords Association, said Labour's package would make owners less likely to risk their money in providing homes while banks would be deterred from advancing loans. In his policy package, Mr Miliband also said he wanted to 'restore the dream of home ownership' by giving first-time buyers a stamp duty holiday on homes up to £300,000 in value. He said up to half of new homes would be earmarked for local residents trying to get a foot on the property ladder, while higher taxes would be imposed on foreign buyers. Mr Miliband's housing announcements are an attempt to regain the initiative after the Tories unveiled a popular policy two weeks ago to extend the right to buy to all tenants of housing associations. The Labour leader said housing would be a late addition on his party's election pledge card – increasing the number of pledges from five to six. Mr Miliband said the pledge to cut stamp duty to zero over the next three years would benefit nine out of ten people buying their first home, could save up to £5,000 and would cost the Government £225million a year. Chancellor George Osborne dismissed Mr Miliband's stamp duty pledge as a 'complete gimmick'. Naomi Heaton, of London Central Portfolio, an asset management company, said Mr Miliband's housing policy was 'a load of old cobblers'. 'Labour are clearly very bad at their sums, which is why, of course, we are so worried about them running the economy,' she said. 'The average purchase price for a first time buyer outside London is £137,120, according to the Halifax. Following the new stamp duty reforms introduced by the Conservative coalition last December, the stamp duty charge for buyers at this level is just £242. 'This is what the Labour policy would save – not £5,000.' Jenny Luckitt, of campaign group Generation Rent, said: 'These policies to cut stamp duty do nothing for affordability. 'They merely stimulate demand and drive house prices even further out of reach of ordinary first-time buyers. 'Limiting this policy to the first two years of government is a gimmick that will only drive up prices as people scramble to buy before the 'holiday' is over.' Trump card: The Labour leader said housing would be a late addition on his party's election pledge card – increasing the number of pledges from five to six . David Orr, of the National Housing Federation, said: 'Slashing stamp duty could lead to even higher demand on homes for first-time buyers, pushing up prices even further out of reach, while not addressing the supply of homes we so desperately need.' Mr Miliband dismissed the backlash, saying: 'Our proposals will be better for home owners in Britain and for companies building homes in Britain. 'We have a housing market that is frankly not working and we have government that is not unblocking the real barriers there are in the housing market.' Mr Miliband added: 'We won't let those large developers just hoard land – waiting for it to go up in value when it could be used to build homes. 'We'll say: Either you use the land or you lose the land.'","Red Ed wants councils to encourage building by hiking tax on unused land .

"Baywatch star Jeremy Jackson, pictured in January, has been arrested after a man was stabbed in the chest with a knife . Baywatch star Jeremy Jackson has been arrested after a man was stabbed in the chest with a knife - and identified his attacker as 'Hobie' from the hit show. Jackson was taken into police custody on Saturday for assault with a deadly weapon in West Lake, LA. The 34-year-old is accused of stabbing a man with a knife on Friday - his relationship to the man is not clear. The victim told police the man was Hobie - Jackson played Hobie Buchannon, the son of David Hasselhoff's character Mitch Buchannon on Baywatch. On Saturday, police received a report of a possible prowler in the same neighborhood where the attack took place, reports the LA Times. Officers stopped that alleged prowler and discovered it was Jackson – who was wanted in the stabbing. He was immediately arrested at 7:15am. Jackson was released that same day on $30,000 bail, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Jackson, of Newport Beach, Calif., has not addressed the arrest on social media. He is well-known for his troubled personal life. He left Baywatch, which he starred in from 1991-1999, because he was suffering from a severe drug addiction, according to an interview with E! on Child Star Confidential. And in 2011 he was treated for steroid addiction on Celebrity Rehab with Dr Drew. In January, the former child star was kicked out of UK reality show Celebrity Big Brother for groping a glamor model in a drunken stupor - he was later cautioned by police. Celebrity blogger Perez Hilton, a fellow contestant, had questioned the wisdom of Jackson taking part in the show, saying that the actor was not 'mentally stable' and 'borderline scary'. Earlier this year the MailOnline revealed the former Baywatch star is alleged to have attempted to murder his ex-wife in an attack caught in a terrifying audio recording. Jackson with David Hasselhoff when he played his character's son Hobie Buchannon . The recording captures Jackson allegedly pouncing on fitness model Loni Willison as she lay in bed at their Los Angeles home. Loni, 31, can be heard screaming in terror as Jackson allegedly strangled and beat her, leaving her with two broken ribs, an injured neck and scratches on her face and body. LA police officers were called to the incident last August and in a police report seen by MailOnline the star was accused of 'attempt murder' – a case later dropped after distraught Loni decided not to press charges. The police report said: 'Susp. argued with vict (spous & cohab), susp used both hands to strangle vict and covered vict's nose and mouth with his left hand, preventing victim from breathing.' The MailOnline revealed in January the former Baywatch star is alleged to have attempted to murder his ex-wife, Loni Willison,  in an attack caught in a terrifying audio recording . Loni, 31, can be heard screaming in terror as Jackson allegedly strangled and beat her, leaving her with two broken ribs, an injured neck and scratches on her face and body . She also released a second recording of the unstable actor in which he threatens to kill her in a bizarre, incoherent rap song he emailed to her a day before the alleged attack. The 12-minute rambling ditty demonstrates Jackson's state of mind as he spiraled out of control. Loni said she hoped her ex would seek the help he desperately needs to 'fix' his problems. Loni did not press charges against Jackson at the time as she said she didn't want to land him in jail and he filed divorce papers. The model first met Jackson in 2003 but they didn't begin a serious relationship until March 2010. She moved into Jackson's Beverly Hills home five months later and the couple tied the knot on January 12, 2012 - a date chosen because it was 12.12.12. The recording emerged after the former child star was kicked out of UK reality show Celebrity Big Brother for groping a glamor model in a drunken stupor - he was later cautioned by police . Photos of the intimate ceremony in Laguna Beach, California, were spread across the pages of a glossy magazine and show a couple very much in love. But cracks in the relationship soon began to show when Loni decided to study an aesthetician course and could not spend as much time with Jackson as he wanted. She also believes Jackson may have started using drugs again as he began behaving differently and was prone to depressive mood swings and violent outbursts. A spokesman for Jackson said he had no comment when contacted by MailOnline in January following the revelations.

"In emails urging his sister Bianca Rinehart to join him in legal action against their mother Gina Rinehart over their trust fund, John Hancock repeatedly called her 'the fat' and 'fatty'. The emails were tendered as the daughter of mining magnate Gina Rinehart was reduced to tears after being forced to sign a deed against her interests, the Federal Court in Sydney heard. Bianca Rinehart, along with her brother John Hancock, lodged a Federal Court to increase their stake in the family company, Hancock Prospecting, according to the ABC. Scroll down for video . Happier times: John Hancock (left) and his mother Gina Rinehart meet the press together in 2002 . Bianca Rinehart appeared in a Sydney court to give evidence in an ugly legal battle over the family's finances . However, emails between 2004 and 2006 were tendered showing Mr Hancock told his sister 'Fat would have quickly grown tired of supporting your shopping and leisure activities' and 'hopefully you will have another man to take care of you', in the aftermath of her break up with swimmer Grant Hackett, The Daily Telegraph reports. 'You can send my correspondence and your reply to fatty (in hoping she will pay for your Mandarin education), but at the end of the day you will still come off second best,' Mr Hancock wrote in May 2004. Nearly a decade later, the siblings are united in a bitter trust dispute against their mother, the richest person in Australia. Ms Rinehart's lawyer, Christopher Withers, said his client had been effectively bullied into signing an agreement regarding her grandfather's second wife Rose Porteous. 'Your honour will see from Bianca Rinehart's evidence that she felt threatened and isolated,' Mr Withers said. 'She was distressed and crying in Hancock Prospecting's offices. We say that the inequality of bargaining power was palpable.' 'This is a young woman who was compelled by her mother and Hancock Prospecting to sign a deed against her will.' Ms Rinehart also told the Federal Court she became aware her personal email account had been hacked, and said 'all of my emails have been deleted, which I didn't do', according to Fairfax Media. The Rinehart children currently control 23 per cent of the company, while Gina Rinehart has a stake of more than 76 per cent. The siblings want to access to records of mining profits, and accused their mother of defrauding them of billions of dollars. Ms Rinehart, along with her brother John Hancock, lodged a Federal Court to increase their stake in the family company, Hancock Prospecting . However, Counsel for Gina Rinehart countered the claims of Ms Rinehart by asserting she was dishonest in her sworn affidavit in regards to what she  was told about the family's mining interests. Ms Rinehart was also asked if she printed confidential emails and stored them in her office when she was a director of Hancock Prospecting, while under cross-examination from her mother's lawyers. Ms Rinehart said she printed important emails needed to be kept, but she denied storing them in the office. 'That would be quite stupid of me to do,' she said. The Rinehart siblings have accused their mother of defrauding them of billions of dollars, and are disputing ownership of assets and shares the family's mining companies . She said she kept the emails at home and that, at one point, her work emails had been 'compromised'. She also denied the emails related to company information she had previously accused her mother of willfully hiding from her.

"A respected Philadelphia law professor  who made national headlines after accidentally emailing her students a porn link has spoken out about how she's reclaiming her dignity since the public scandal. Lisa McElroy, 50, reportedly sent the explicit link to her Drexel University students under the subject line 'Great article on writing briefs' on March 31. McElroy said she was 'mortified' and 'in terrible shape' when she found out what she had done, she wrote in a column for the Washington Post. Respected Drexel University law professor Lisa McElroy, 50, who made national headlines last month after accidentally emailing her students a porn link, has spoken out about reclaiming her dignity since the scandal . The legal writing professor, who earned a doctorate from Harvard Law School, writes that she was sure she had lost her 'dignity forever' when news of the scandal first broke. 'Everyone was talking about me,' she said. 'Everyone was speculating about whether I watched porn, or used sex toys, or liked kinky sex. Some people were calling for my job and law license.' The professor said she would not divulge in her column how the mistake happened. 'If you're hoping to find out here how that happened, among the many possibilities that have been raised by gleeful commentators, I’m sorry to tell you you’re going to be disappointed.' But McElroy did explain her concern that, with a profession where she teaches 'students to project a dignified image' and 'possess integrity', people would no longer believe the teacher could follow her own lessons. Drexel  conducted an internal investigation after the incident and  found that McElroy, a tenured professor, had not violated the the university's sexual harassment and misconduct policy. The university said in a statement that federal law requires it investigate all reports of 'inappropriate behaviors of a sexual nature'. The professor defends Drexel's  decision to investigate the matter. She wrote that critics of the university were 'dismissing the dignity of the law' and 'giving no consideration to an atmosphere in which the law exists to protect people and an investigation may be necessary'. But McElroy said she wondered why no one thought to question the 'dignity of those who forwarded the unintended post'. 'No one asked why, if they found it so offensive, students opened the link, with its unmistakable Web address, and watched the video long enough to know what it contained,' she said. In fact, McElroy writes, there wasn't anything newsworthy about the mistake she calls 'pretty trivial' at all. 'My students are adults. The link was quickly removed. There was nothing illegal in the video...Yet, because it was porn and I'm a law professor, news organizations spread the story around the world.' McElroy said she was 'mortified' and 'in terrible shape' when she found out she sent her students an explicit link  under the subject line 'Great article on writing briefs' on March 31 . McElroy also questions both the dignity of the 'tabloid journalists', who called her cellphone number and waited outside her office to interview students, and the 'intended audience' they knew would want to read the story in the first place. Readers, she said, 'enjoyed the scandal (where is Olivia Pope when you need her?), the thrill of the sexual and the salacious, the speculation'. 'Gossip was natural.' The professor said the incident made her wonder what the definition of dignity - and who holds the power to decide it - really was. 'Is it the degraded person who lacks dignity? Or the person who seeks to degrade her?' she asks. 'If a person is portrayed as less than dignified, does that mean she is? Who has the power to decide?' But McElroy said that, almost a month later, she has found the power to decide at least what her own personal definition of dignity is - realizing that it's something she can get back. 'You can reimagine yourself, and your reputation, and your professional image,' she writes. 'You can come to realize that there are worse things than humiliation. There is cancer. There is isolation. And there is the willingness — even the desire — to bring others down to lift yourself up. 'You can go back.'

John Sims, who had Burkitt's Lymphoma died on Saturday, with his new wife Lindsey Sims by his side. The pair married March 21 at MD Anderson Cancer Center after John, who was to turn 31 tomorrow, was told his cancer, was terminal . After the wedding they set off on a a cross-country road trip last week, hoping to make it to visit John's friend Dave in Oregon. 'We've driven through the mountains, we've been in snow.

'This world will be a much sadder place without John in it,' Lindsey told KHOU11 News. 'The biggest thing that John would want to take away is that there is still love out there,' said Lindsey. Burkitt’s lymphoma is a relatively rare and aggressive form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It affects  lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell - which are found in the blood and in lymph glands. Lymphoma is a disease where lymphocyte B-cells grow in an uncontrolled way. Patients with the cancer experience a swelling in the lymph nodes. If Burkitts lymphoma is in the chest or throat, people can have difficulty swallowing or breathing, whereas if it appears as a lump in the abdomen, it can cause pain, swelling, nausea and diarrhoea. 'Everyone deserves to be loved. You love selflessly, you love with everything you have and he's done that and I've done that and it's made for an incredible story. Something that I will cherish forever.' The pair, began dating in January 2013 after meeting online. But six months into their relationship, John was was diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma.

"Condemned Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran has requested to spend his last days before his execution painting for as long as possible. His final request comes as images from Nusakambangan showed a haunting self portrait painted by Sukumaran in his cell, depicting the artist shot through the heart. His brother, Chinthu Sukumaran has pleaded with the Indonesian president to call off the firing squad while Sukumaran's lawyer was pictured removing the morbid paintings from the death row inmate's cell. Sukumaran's fellow death row inmate, Andrew Chan, has requested to spend his last hours in church with his family. Scroll down for video . Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran has requested to spend his final days painting. He painted this self-portrait, showing a bullet through his heart . The painting is a self-portrait of Sukumaran with a bullet hole through his heart . It comes after it was confirmed that Australians Andrew Chan and Sukumaran will be executed just after the stroke of midnight on Wednesday (3am AEST). The date - April 29 - became official when a local funeral director in Cilacap, the nearest port to Nusakambangan, or Death Island, was instructed to inscribe the names of those to be shot by firing squad and the date of their deaths. Sukumaran only began painting when he was arrested and sent to prison in 2005. His skill and love for his art grew as he was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty - who has also led the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives.

Julian McMahon (pictured) the lawyer for the Bali Nine pair, removed the morbid paintings from Sukumaran's cell . McMahon looked downcast as he carried the paintings back from Death Island . Painting has proven a great sense of solace for Sukumaran during his time in jail and has even run art classes for fellow inmates as part of the drug rehabilitation program that he set up with Chan. The talented artist's birthday in early April was marked in London where his cousin organised an exhibition of his paintings at the Amnesty International headquarters. The Bali Nine pair's lawyer Julian McMahon took four disturbing self portrait from Sukumaran's cell on Sunday, depicting the artist shot through the heart. The paintings were signed: 'Our new prison.

Chan and Sukumaran both refused to sign their execution warrants during official proceedings on Saturday, saying they believed it would be unjust to kill them. Chan and Sukumaran, convicted in 2005 for their role in a plot to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia, were given the official 72 hours notice on Saturday. 'He's found peace with what may happen but he and we all feel that this is a grave injustice and it did not have to be this way and it still doesn't have to be this way,' Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters, after spending a couple of hours with his brother.

It has been confirmed that the two men will be executed just past midnight on Wednesday . His mother Raji and sister Brintha also visited on Sunday, making the sad journey with Chan's mother Helen, brother Michael and fiancée Feby Herewila and other friends. Chinthu Sukumaran said they asked Joko Widodo to show the same mercy he'd asked for his own citizens on death row overseas. 'Please, please show mercy,' he said. 'There are nine people with families that love them. Sukumaran painted the portraits in the hours before he and Andrew Chan were given execution notices . 'That's mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, brothers and sisters. 'We ask the president to please use his powers to intervene and save their lives.' Mr Chan said his brother's only wish would be to go to church with his family in his last days. 'The two boys are still holding up pretty well considering they feel this is injust (unjust) to what has happened over the last ten years with their whole case,' he said. 'Somewhere in the legal system for Indonesia there's got to be mercy and the president needs to show that now. 'He's the only one that can stop it and it's not too late to do so.' It's reported only nine of the 10 prisoners Indonesia had readied for execution will face the firing squad, with Frenchman Serge Atlaoui granted a reprieve. Mr Atlaoui apparently won a reprieve based on an administrative matter. Mr McMahon carried Sukumaran's self-portraits away after showing them to reporters . The back of Sukumaran's morbid paintings read: 'self portrait' 72hrs just started' The paintings were signed by Sukumaran and dated . Sukumaran and Chan have been granted more time with family in their final days and will see them again on Monday. Lawyers are pleading with Jakarta to respect legal proceedings that several are still pursuing, while international pressure for mercy also grows. France has pledged to work with Australia to halt the executions, with Prime Minister Tony Abbott set to meet Francois Hollande on Monday. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been seeking urgent talks with her Indonesian counterpart since Friday. Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers have lodged a challenge with the constitutional court but the attorney-general doesn't acknowledge it, arguing the pair have exhausted their appeals.

Chinthu Sukumaran said they asked Joko Widodo to show the same mercy he'd asked for his own citizens on death row overseas. Sukumaran began painting when he was in Kerobokan Prison in Bali . But his office is yet to respond to moves by lawyers for Filipina Mary Jane Veloso, who filed a second request for a judicial review late on Friday. Indonesia Zainal Abidin has an appeal before the courts due to be decided on Monday, but has been moved in preparation of execution as if the result is pre-determined. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has added his voice to global calls for Indonesia to halt its execution plans. 'The Secretary General urges President Joko Widodo to urgently consider declaring a moratorium on capital punishment in Indonesia, with a view toward abolition,' a spokesman for Ban said. Last ditch efforts to save the pair have also been launched by not-for-profit organisations, such as Amnesty International. His work was showcased at an exhibition in London on his birthday .

Earlier, Australian embassy officials were called to Cilacap, the port town closest to Nusakambangan where the Bali Nine pair are now jailed, for a meeting about Indonesia's execution plans. 'I fear the worst,' Ms Bishop told reporters in Brussels. 'I fear that Indonesia will seek to proceed with the execution of the two Australian citizens. 'I am deeply and profoundly concerned by this.'

"A father and son were shot dead in an execution-style murder moments after party guests left their home in a quiet neighborhood. Nicholas Pence, 25, and his father David, an oil company manager, had been celebrating a victorious football game in their garage in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Wednesday. But moments after jovially waving goodbye to the last-remaining revelers shortly before midnight, they were both shot dead at close range in an attack that shocked and baffled the quiet community of Metairie. They were found by David's wife, Nicholas's mother, who had been in a bedroom when she heard gun shots. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Nicholas Pence, 25, (left) and his father David, 56, (right) were shot dead 'execution-style' at home on Wednesday night after a football party in their garage, or 'man cave'. Police believe it was a botched burglary . Tragic: They were found lifeless by Elizabeth Pence (center), mother to Nicholas (second left) and wife to David (right) moments after the shooting, which has left the quiet neighborhood of Metairie in mourning and shock . Charged: Police arrested Dexter Allen, 17, (left), and Haraqyon Degruy, 18, (right) in connection with the killings . On Sunday, police revealed 18-year-old Haraqyon Degruy and her friend Dexter Allen, 17, have been charged with the double killing. Neither have a 'significant' criminal history, officers revealed. The police investigation has failed to determine at link between the alleged assailants and their victims, or a motive. David Pence, a manager at a New Orleans branch of the international oil firm Baker Hughes Inc, was shot three times in the chest while sat in an armchair. Nicholas was shot in the face and back. He was found lying on the floor of their so-called 'man cave'. Elizabeth Pence dialed 911 to report the shooting, and the theft of her purse, iPod and iPhone. Friends of Nicholas, known to friends as Nick or 'Peezy', have set up a fundraising page to supplement funeral costs and support his surviving mother and sister. The family lived on Clifford Drive, a leafy part of Metairie, which is one of New Orleans' wealthier areas . Initial reports suggest it could have been a botched armed burglary, as Allen and Degruy were linked to earlier car break-ins. Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said: 'Once again, this particular happenstance was completely, totally, shock-the-conscience type of homicide — obviously execution-style, very close.' Members of the community have expressed their horror, describing Nicholas and David as outgoing and lively neighbors. 'They were very good people. They got along with everybody.' close family friend Paul Meyer told WWL TV. 'I can't comprehend how someone could do this to a family like that.'

"The family of a four-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted and murdered more than 75 years ago have accused police of a 'cover-up' after officers ordered that the case file be kept secret until 2040. Joyce Cox was just days away from celebrating her fifth birthday when she was strangled to death on her way home from school in Cardiff on September 28, 1939. The schoolgirl had been walking with her older brother Dennis, who was seven at the time, but she disappeared when he lost sight of her. Her body was found dumped by a railway station but police have never caught her killer. Now, Terry Phillips, 71, who is Joyce's cousin, has accused the Metropolitan Police of a 'cover-up' after the force said information could not be released about her murder because it is unfair to the mystery suspect. Joyce Cox was just days away from celebrating her fifth birthday when she was strangled to death on her way home from school in Cardiff on September 28, 1939. Her body was found but her killer has never been caught . The front page of the South Wales Echo shows the newspaper report following Joyce's death in September 1939, and reveals how officers want to track down a 'man with a slouch' in connection with her murder . Mr Phillips, who was not born at the time his relative was abducted and killed, used the Freedom of Information Act to find out more information about the case. He contacted the Met about the killing - the oldest unsolved murder in Wales - since the London-based force was drafted in to help South Wales Police with serious crimes at the time. He said that while he managed to establish that the force holds documents about the case, officers slapped an order on the file demanding it be kept secret for 100 years after the events concerned - until January 2040. A decision letter sent to Mr Phillips said: 'A named subject who was a suspect is described derogatorily and should not be associated with these matters. 'As an unsolved murder, with potential of re-investigation at any indeterminate stage, practice to close for 100 years is invoked. The family of Joyce (pictured) are accusing police of a 'cover-up' for not releasing paperwork on the case . 'However unlikely - indeed remote - it may be that this case is re-opened, we have to afford for that possibility. Putting information into the public domain will include naming specific persons who may yet be identified. 'These persons who may be living may have been witnesses and/or interviewees and who were not prosecuted and who therefore must be regarded as innocent parties. 'Persons will have given witness statements in the expectation that their information would not become public knowledge.' Mr Phillips said he 'does not accept the reason for refusing to release the documents'. He said: 'This smacks of a cover-up to me. As a result of this decision, which I am appealing against, I wouldn't get access to the file until I was 96, even if I lived that long. 'Joyce's murder had a devastating impact on the family. Dennis never forgave himself for letting Joyce out of his sight as they walked home. 'He never came to terms with it and died about eight years ago.' The body of Joyce, who lived in the Whitchurch area of Cardiff, was found on a railway embankment near Coryton station just weeks after Britain declared war on Germany. It was discovered by a dog walker who came across her remains when his spaniel began barking. Dozens of Joyce's schoolfriends turned out for her funeral on October 4, 1939, as documented in the South Wales Echo & Evening Express (above). The funeral procession went through Whitchurch in Cardiff . Joyce was buried at St Mary's Parish Church in Cardiff and has since been joined by her late mother Irene . Police found a copy of the Western Mail newspaper and a tobacco pouch near her body, and outlined at least two suspects in connection with her murder. Newspaper reports from the South Wales Echo at the time, reveal how police wanted to trace a 'man with a slouch' in connection with the killing. However, despite interviewing more than one thousand people and following numerous leads, Joyce's killer has never been caught. Mr Phillips, who is desperate to learn more information about the case, has since been in touch with a leading forensic scientist who has told him that advances in DNA technology could now make it possible to identify the killer. The family believe that had the murder occurred in modern day then her killer would have been caught. MailOnline has contacted Metropolitan Police and South Wales Police for comment.","Joyce Cox was aged four when she was sexually assaulted and murdered .

"A Soviet dissident who spent 12 years in prison and forced labour camps is to be charged with making and possessing indecent images of children after a police investigation. Vladimir Bukovsky, 72, has lived in the UK since he fled the Soviet Union in the 1970s after he was accused of spreading anti-Soviet propaganda. It came after he managed to smuggle to the West 150 pages of documents detailing the abuse of psychiatric institutions for political reasons in the Communist state. Soviet-era dissident Vladimir Bukovsky, who has been summonsed to appear in court next month to be charged with making and possessing indecent images of children . But now Bukovsky has been summonsed to appear at Cambridge Magistrates early next month following an investigation by Cambridgeshire Police, the Crown Prosecution Service said. He will be charged with five counts of making an indecent photograph of a child, five counts of possessing indecent photographs of children, and one count of possessing a prohibited image. Jenny Hopkins, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS in the East of England, said: 'Following an investigation by Cambridgeshire Police, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to prosecute Vladimir Bukovsky in relation to the alleged making and possessing of indecent images of children.' She added: 'The decision to prosecute was taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.' Bukovsky is a dissident, author and activist who spent 12 years in Soviet prisons, forced-labour camps and forced-treatment psychiatric hospitals. He was first arrested by the Soviet authorities when he was part of a group of young activists who held public readings of banned poetry and organised demonstrations against the heavy-handed tactics of the authorities. The revelations sparked an international outcry, and Bukovsky was arrested for the spread of anti-Soviet propaganda. In 1976 he finally secured his freedom when he was exchanged by the Soviet government for the Chilean Communist party leader Luis Corvalan. He was described by The Daily Telegraph as 'pale and haggard' and 'underfed with an accelerated heartbeat' after his long incarceration. Bukovsky will appear at Cambridge Magistrates Court, pictured, on May 5 after receiving a summons. He denies the allegations . He moved to Britain soon after and has lived in Cambridge ever since. He is a senior fellow at the libertarian think-tank the Cato Institute, according to its website. Bukovsky has written many books about his experience, including his memoir To Build a Castle: My Life as a Dissenter, and he has repeatedly called for Russians to stand up to president Vladimir Putin. He accused Russia of orchestrating the murder of former spy Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned by radioactive polonium-210 which was slipped into his tea at a Mayfair hotel. At a hearing with Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina in 2013 he said: 'Since the Russian authorities got away with this murder they continue the practice. They encourage the Soviet regime to continue murdering people. 'It's like giving them a licence to kill, like announcing a season for hunting.' In 2004 he was one of the founders of the Committee 2008 whose purpose is to ensure free and fair elections in Russia. Bukovsky has denied the accusations and the charges against him and has said that he will vigorously deny them. He will appear at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on May 5.

"The leader of Kazakhstan has apologised after winning the presidential election with 97 per cent of the vote saying it would have been 'undemocratic' for him to make his victory more modest. Nursultan Nazarbayev, a 74-year-old former steel worker who has ruled the oil-producing nation since 1989, has won another five year term. Kazakh television showed a triumphant Nazarbayev walking on a red carpet, smiling and shaking hands and greeting thousands of jubilant supporters at a forum in the capital Astana. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has been re-elected as president of Kazakhstan after winning 97 per cent of the vote . But international monitors have voiced their concern about the poll saying there was not a genuine choice of other candidates with most of his vocal opponents either being jailed or fled abroad. However, at a news conference, Nazarbayev said: 'I apologise that for super-democratic states such figures are unacceptable. But I could do nothing. 'If I had interfered, I would have looked undemocratic, right?' The election was called more than a year before Nazarbayev's term was due to end, averting the risk that another year of economic pain could develop into a more serious challenge to his leadership. It also puts the question of a possible successor, an important issue for investors, off the table for now. Kazakhstan has been criticised by the West and human rights bodies for crackdowns on dissent. No election held there has yet been given a clean bill of health by monitors. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping promptly congratulated Nazarbayev on his re-election. Nazarbayev told a news conference after his victory that if he had interfered in the vote, it would have been undemocratic . Meanwhile Nazarbayev has promoted market reforms in the country and attracted $200 billion in foreign direct investment, turning his nation of 17 million into the second-largest economy in the former Soviet Union and number two post-Soviet oil producer after Russia. The multi-ethnic, mainly Muslim country is stable in a region troubled by ethnic violence from Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan. Nazarbayev has promoted 'a multi-vector policy', building good ties with neighbouring Russia and China as well as the United States and the European Union. But the economy has been hurt in the past year by the decline in global energy prices and by economic difficulty in neighbouring Russia, hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine. Kazakh economic growth is forecast to slow to 1.5 percent this year from a 4.3 percent rise in 2014. Gross domestic product may actually shrink if oil prices drop to below $50 per barrel, Kazakh officials have said.","Nursultan Nazarbayev has been re-elected as the president of Kazakhstan .

"Around two tonnes of cocaine have been seized from a boat intercepted at sea by the Royal Navy and the Border Force. The ocean-going tug MV Hamal was intercepted by the frigate HMS Somerset and Border Force cutter Valiant about 100 miles east of the Aberdeenshire coast.

The crew of the Hamal, nine men aged between 26 and 63, were detained for questioning by investigators from the National Crime Agency's Border Policing Command, and later charged with drug trafficking offences . It was accompanied to Aberdeen where a full search was carried out. The value of the cocaine is likely to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds, depending on its purity. The crew of the Hamal, nine men aged between 26 and 63, were detained for questioning by investigators from the National Crime Agency's Border Policing Command, and later charged with drug trafficking offences. They remain in custody and are due to appear at Aberdeen Sheriff Court on Monday. The joint operation also involved the National Crime Agency (NCA).

"The mother-in-law of one of one of the Boston bombers has taken to the stand to tell how her daughter was converted to Islam by her husband, as lawyers try to argue the other brother out of being put to death. Judith Russell, whose daughter Katherine married Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the two mass murderers who set of bombs at the 2013 Boston marathon, spoke at a court in the city today. Her words came as jurors decide whether Tamerlan's brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, should be put to death after being convicted of a host of crimes in connection with the massacre. Scroll down for video . On the stand: Judith Russell, pictured right in a 2013 file photo, took to the stand in the trial of Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. She told how her daughter Katherine, left, converted to Islam after meeting Dzhokhar's brother Tamerlan . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, pictured three months after his arrest for the Boston bombing, flipping off a camera in his jail cell. His defense team argued on Monday he is a 'good boy' and should be spared the death penalty for killing three people and injuring several hundred in the 2013 terrorist attacks . Tamerlan himself was killed in a police firefight a few days after the bombing, which he masterminded. Change: Katherine Russell is pictured in a yearbook photo, before she converted to Islam . Defense lawyers for Dzhokhar have made the argument that he should not be killed because he was in some capacity forced into the killings by his more persuasive elder sibling. Russell was brought before the jury as a defense witness - and told how Tamerlan met her daughter and got her pregnant before gradually becoming more radical in her views. Russell told jurors she drifted from her daughter as a result of the relationship - and that at some point was shocked to find her wearing the veil and a new convert to her husband's faith. Though Russell admitted that Katherine seemed to take on the religion of her own volition - and still upholds it - her testimony indicated that he was the cause and she considered the move a sacrifice for him. At one point she revealed that Tamerlan, who was originally unemployed and unmotivated, became so zealous in his faith that he tried to force literature on her, too, and encourage her to convert. She told jurors that she has an Islam For Dummies book on her shelf at home, but couldn't remember who gave it to her. She said she had hardly met Dzhokhar or his family, but that she remembered attending a baby shower which the brothers' very religious mother attended. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, an ethnic Chechen, was . found guilty earlier this month of killing three people and injuring 264 as well as fatally shooting a police officer. David Bruck delivered the defense's opening statement in the penalty phase of Tsarnaev's trial, claiming that no punishment Tsarnaev can be given is equal to the suffering of the victims. Influencer? Defense lawyers for Tsarnaev (left) have said that his brother Tamerlan (right) drove his brother to help him with the 2013 killings . 'There is no evening the scales,' Bruck said. 'There is no point in trying to hurt him as he hurt because it can't be done.' During the initial stage of his trial, prosecutors portrayed him as an extremist who wanted to 'punish America' for military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries. The teen followed a blueprint from al Qaeda's Inspire magazine to build the homemade pressure-cooker bombs that ripped through crowds of spectators,volunteers and athletes on April 15, 2013. Bruck urged the jury to sentence the defendant to life in prison without the possibility of ever being released for his crimes. A chilling photo was revealed last week at the Boston bombing trial showing the aftermath of the blasts on Boylston Street . 'His legal case will be over for good, and no martyrdom, just years and years of punishment,' the lawyer said. 'All the while, society is protected.' Bruck told the court that Tsarnaev would be sent to a supermax prison in the Colorado mountains, adding that he would have no privacy, be under a video camera 24 hours a day. He would be allowed no interviews, there would be no autobiography and no messages relayed, the attorney added. Bruck focused heavily on Tsarnaev's  brother, Tamerlan, who died after a gunfight with police four days after the bombing, saying he led the plot and provided the 'fuel' to drive the plan. He said Tamerlan was 'consumed by jihad' and had 'power' over Dzhokhar, who admired his older brother. Bruck contrasted Tamerlan with Dzhokhar, saying Tamerlan was loud and aggressive, got into fights, failed at everything he did and never held a steady job, while Dzhokhar was a good student in high school, was loved by his teachers there, had many friends and never got in a fight. 'He was a good kid,' the lawyer said. But he said Tsarnaev started going downhill in college. One of the first defense witnesses to testify in the penalty phase described an incident at a mosque when  Tamerlan became angry and interrupted prayer services. Imam Loay Assaf testified on Monday that he got very angry during one service in 2013 when Assaf praised Martin Luther King Jr and compared him to the Prophet Mohammad. Assaf says Tamerlan interrupted the service, shouting at him and calling him a 'hypocrite'. Prosecutors have portrayed Tsarnaev as an unrepentant killer who gave the finger to the security camera in his jail cell three months after his arrest. The startling photo and video were shown to the jury last week. Bruck downplayed the gesture, saying Tsarnaev was 'acting like an immature 19-year-old'. Defense attorney, Judith Clarke, had opened the trial . with the blunt admission 'it was him,' Tsarnaev, who committed . all the crimes he was charged with. But she closed the guilt . phase by arguing that, when it came to planning the attack and . building the bombs, 'Tamerlan did that.' Defense attorneys Timothy Watkins, left, and David Bruck arrive at federal court on Monday during the penalty phase of the federal trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted of the Boston Marathon bombings that killed three and injured 260 people in April 2013 . In this courtroom sketch, bombing survivor Marc Fucarile, right,  was depicted on the witness stand on Friday during the penalty phase where he stared down Tsarnaev. Fucarile said he has had more than 60 surgeries, and it is still unclear whether his left leg can be saved . In a sharp contrast to the last phase of the trial, when the . defense took just two days to call four witnesses, the court has . scheduled about two weeks' worth of testimony as Tsarnaev's . lawyers make the case to spare his life. Few details are known about who the defense lawyers will call to . testify as all witness lists in this trial have been filed under . seal. On Thursday, local media reported that some members of . Tsarnaev's family arrived in Boston. It is not clear exactly which members of his family traveled . to Boston or if they will testify or simply observe the . proceedings. Another unanswered question is whether Tsarnaev will speak . in his own defense. He has been a quiet presence during the . trial, offering no signs of emotion as the jury heard sometimes . tearful testimony from survivors and viewed graphic, disturbing . images of the bombs' detonation and aftermath. Eight-year-old Martin Richard, Chinese exchange student Lu Lingzi, 23, . and restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, died in the . bombing.

"Pouting and playing with her mother's pearl necklace, Sweden's Princess Leonore looked distinctly out of sorts during a visit to the Vatican. But at just 14-months-old and on the verge of the terrible twos, the infant Duchess of Gotland would probably have preferred to be doing something else. Cradled in the arms of her pregnant mother, Princess Madeleine, 32, the little girl was instead whisked off to meet Pope Francis. Displeased: Princess Leonore looked less than impressed with her trip to the Vatican . Madeleine, who wore a traditional lace mantilla for the occasion, is thought to be around six months pregnant with her second child and will give birth this summer. But before that happens, she has a busy schedule of events in and outside of Sweden to complete - many with her British businessman husband Christopher O'Neill, 40, by her side. Mr O'Neill was also at the Vatican today and shared the childcare with his wife, at one point giving his little daughter a hug. The couple have recently returned to Sweden after years spent living in New York, where Princess Leonore was born just over a year ago. Unlike his or her big sister, the new baby will be born in Stockholm following her parents' move to the city last summer. The birth is likely to coincide with another big royal event, the wedding of Madeleine's older brother, Prince Carl Philip, 35, on the 13th June. Hug from Daddy: Not even the ministrations of father Christopher O'Neill could raise a smile . Playing with pearls: Leonore did find at least one distraction though - her mother's pearls . His bride-to-be, 30-year-old Sofia Hellqvist, is a former glamour model - a career that was the source of controversy when the couple's relationship was made public in January 2010. Ms Hellqvist is expected to become Princess Sofia of Sweden following the wedding, although her title will not be officially decided until the ceremony. Having posed topless in Swedish men's magazines, Ms Hellqvist hit tabloid headlines in 2005 after reaching the final of the scandalous sex and alcohol-fuelled TV show Paradise Hotel. The shows sees five men and five women stay in a hotel together and included a scene in which Sofia was shown kissing pornstar Jenna Jameson. However, in 2009, after she met Carl Philip, who is third in line to the throne, in a club, she has softened her image. Cheerful: Princess Madeleine was all smiles as she made her way into the Vatican . Still cross: The baby was carried in for the audience by her father . Next in line: Prince Carl Philip will marry fiancee Sofia Hellqvist in Stockholm on the 13th June . The relationship was controversial for a time, as Queen Silvia apparently did not entirely approve of the match. But it is the prince himself who has the most colourful past, with his 'Wild Summer' of 2012 still referenced by Sweden's tabloid press which delightedly documented his antics. As well as going on a drunken rampage in central Stockholm while wearing an alien mask, the summer also saw him become the victim of a happy slapping incident during a holiday to Cannes. He also, following a wild night out, managed to lose his wallet and was forced to hitch-hike to the motor race he was due to compete in, before spectacularly crashing his car on the first lap. As the only son of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, the prince was the heir to the throne for a seven months after he was born in May 1979. But in January 1980 the rules were changed and the principle of primogeniture was introduced, meaning the throne will be inherited by the monarch's eldest child, Crown Princess Victoria. She will be succeeded by her daughter Estelle, who was born in February 2012.","14-month-old Princess Leonore was taken to meet the Pope at the Vatican .

"Kayla Mooney, 24, was arrested after allegedly having a sexual relationship with a student during her first year of teaching at Danbury High School . A 24-year-old high school science teacher who was arrested for allegedly having sex with a male student and providing him with alcohol appeared in court on Monday. Kayla Mooney, of Danbury, Connecticut, was charged on March 31 after a seven-week police investigation into a complaint she made about being harassed by the boy’s girlfriend to school officials. Kayla Mooney, who was in her first year teaching science at Danbury High School turned herself in to police. The boy involved with Mooney told police about the sexual relationship they had off campus last year, which appear to be supported by emails between the pair. Mooney was placed on administrative leave in February and has not commented on the allegations, according to CBS New York. Though she appeared in Danbury Superior Court on Monday, her arraignment on charges of second-degree sexual assault and distributing alcohol to a minor was postponed because her attorney requested evidence from prosecutors. Sal Pascarella, the superintendent of schools, sent high school parents a message last month to inform them of the teacher's arrest. 'We are all very disappointed that this has happened to one of our faculty members,' Pascarella said, but added: 'Obviously, there is a whole process we have to go through with this investigation. At this point, these are allegations.' Kayla Mooney, 24, was seen leaving Danbury Superior Court in Monday after she was arrested for allegedly having sex with a student . Mooney was allegedly busted after she complained to school administrators that the boy's girlfriend was harassing her . The teacher was done in by emails she exchanged with the student, police allege . Mooney, who grew up in Danbury, attended North Dakota State University and Western Connecticut State University. Property records show she still lives with her family in Danbury. She taught chemistry and physics classes at the school, the Danbury Daily Voice reported. She is the third area teacher to face sexual misconduct charges since February, according to the News Times. The first, Sacred Heart University instructor Timothy Leonard, was put on leave on February 11 after allegedly sexually assaulting a 14-year-old boy in an SUV parked in a movie theater parking lot. Then a first-grade teacher, Brian Stroh, resigned from Bethel Elementary School on February 19 and has been charged with sexually abusing three children. He has been released on bail. After Mooney complained the the boy's girlfriend was harassing her, the school launched a seven-week investigation in which the boy told police about his sexual relationship last year with the science teacher .","Kayla Mooney, who is in her first year teaching in Danbury, Connecticut, 'engaged in sexual contact with a male student off campus last year'

"Ed Miliband's poor leadership has been mocked by a Labour candidate, who said it was like having 'a manager of a football team that you don't rate, but you still support the team'. Paul Gilbert even joked that he hoped his 'off-piste' comment would not 'find it's way back' to the Labour leadership, because he stands little hope of winning in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He also blasted Labour's 'entirely unsatisfactory' policy on tuition fees and told voters at a university hustings: 'I don't like where we are.' Scroll down for video . Labour candidate Paul Gilbert mocked Ed Miliband and then joked that he hoped his 'off-piste' comment would not 'find it's way back' to the Labour leadership . Mr Miliband has faced repeated criticism and off-the-record briefing about his leadership among Labour ranks, but most have seen the sense of keeping quiet about their misgivings during the election campaign. But Mr Gilbert felt no such reservations as he appeared at a hustings event with four other candidates. The 52-year-old lawyer was asked for his comments on higher eduction funding by a member of the audience at the packed event at the University of Gloucestershire. He said: 'If I can go off-piste a little, as somebody who has a very realistic idea of what the maths will be in this constituency, maybe what I say isn't going to find it's way back to Mr Miliband and his friends.' He added: 'Now one of the things which has brought me to politics at this very late stage you might think is the wish to make a difference. Now I am a Labour man and I will stand by my party, thick and thin. 'It's a bit like having a manager of a football team that you don't rate, but you still support the team, sometimes. 'What we have to do is work out how we can make the difference best, and from my point of view you're better on the inside making a difference than being on the outside grumbling about it.' To laughter from the audience, he was mocked by one of his fellow candidates for his 'glowing endorsement' for Labour's leader. Ed Miliband, pictured giving a speech in Stockton-on-Tees today, has promised to cut tuition fees from up to £9,000 to £6,000 if he is elected on May 7 . Ed Miliband has revealed his childhood dream was to become a London bus conductor. The Labour leader said a fascination with the ticket machines on the old-style vehicles had made him want the job. Mr Miliband made the admission during a visit to Stockton-on-Tees, where he was asked by a young boy in the audience, Nelson Driscoll, what he wanted to be when he was seven years old. He replied: 'I wanted to be a bus conductor. I tell you why, because on the London buses there used to be these things where you used to turn around the ticket machine. I was particularly fascinated by that.' Mr Miliband is not the only party leader to have dreamed of being on the buses. Conservative former prime minister Sir John Major once failed a test to become a bus conductor. The seat of Cheltenham is held by the Lib Dem Martin Horwood, who secured a majority of 4,920 over the Conservatives in 2010. But the constituency is seen as crucial to Tory hopes of winning an overall majority in the Commons. However, five years ago Labour secured just 5 per cent of the vote. Mr Miliband has promised to cut tuition fees from up to £9,000 to £6,000 if he is elected on May 7. Critics have argued the only people to benefit from the reductions will be wealthy graduates, because most people would never pay back the full amount during their working lifetime. But Mr Gilbert appeared to suggest the party should have gone further in reducing the cost of gaining a degree. He said: 'You know that in the Labour manifesto the fees will come down to £6,000 - it still feels entirely unsatisfactory.' He added: 'But it seems to me with two daughters who are 22 and 20, and they have been saddled with debt as the gentleman in the audience mentioned earlier. 'I find it really silly and really ridiculous that we have not worked this one through sufficiently well. 'We have choices. We have choices for all sorts of things, but we choose to spend the money on other things, and I wish we didn't, I wish we really didn't.' He finished his criticism of his party by adding: 'I don't like where we are, I wish it was different, but I hope we can see it differently going forward.'","Paul Gilbert jokes he hopes 'off-piste' remark will not get back to Miliband .

"The baby who died in Poldark's emotional season finale last night is a true survivor in real-life, having beaten the odds to live after she was born prematurely. Little Matilda Fitt - who played baby Julia Poldark in the BBC drama  - was born to 34-year-old Hannah Fitt nine weeks early in their home town of Barry, South Wales, weighing just 2lb 12oz. Matilda, now 21 months old, won the part to make her small screen debut only weeks after leaving the hospital, where she was treated for pneumonia. Scroll down for video . Little Matilda Fitt (left) - who played baby Julia Poldark in the BBC drama (right) - was born nine weeks early in Barry, South Wales, weighing just 2lb 12oz . Matilda was chosen to play to Julie, who in the TV show died from putrid throat, because of her small size. Now Mrs Fitt has revealed how watching the scene brought tears to her eyes. 'It was very emotional seeing it because of what we’ve been through,' she said. 'Matilda was in and out of hospital for check-ups and tests since birth. She had a lot of breathing difficulties and pneumonia. 'But last September she was finally discharged from hospital consultant care and a few weeks later she won the part of Julia.' Mrs Fitt took Matilda  for the filming in Cornwall last year to meet stars Aiden Turner and Eleanor Tomlison. Matilda was chosen to play to Julie, who in the TV show died from putrid throat, because of her small size . Matilda, now 21 months old, lives with her mother Hannah, 34, (left) and dad Matthew, 33, (right) 'The cast were all great with her and Aiden Turner is as lovely as everyone says,' she said. 'All the cast were - especially Eleanor. She’s a very special person, extremely down to earth and just lovely - she was great with Matilda. 'Some scenes were tricky to nail because baby Julia is supposed to be really poorly and we knew Matilda did have to die on camera. 'As you can imagine, getting a 15-month-old to play dead was no easy feat but she coped really well. 'In one scene she is lying on a bed fully made-up and the doctor is mopping her brow. But I was there with sweets to make sure she was happy.' Matilda was on set for five days and even had her own trailer . 'As you can imagine, getting a 15-month-old to play dead was no easy feat but she coped really well,' said Mrs Fitt, pictured on set with Matilda . Millions tuned in to watch the series finale yesterday evening, and were shocked by the death of Ross and Demalza’s baby daughter. Julia caught putrid throat from her mother, who contracted it after the disease broke out among the people of Trenwith. Matilda, who lives with her mum and dad Matthew Fitt, 33, was cast as the older of two young children who played Julia. Matilda, pictured, won the part to make her small screen debut only weeks after leaving the hospital, where she was treated for pneumonia . Matilda was in and out of hospital for check-ups and tests for months after her birth, and her mother said watching the Poldark death scene brought tears to her eyes . 'We want everyone to know that in real life Julie - or Matilda - is very well and doing fine,' her mother said, describing her daughter as 'a little star' Mrs Fitt, who works for the SAFE Foundation helping disadvantaged people, said: 'It was only a few weeks after she was released from hospital care that my sister-in-law saw the casting call for a baby girl. 'We decided to put her forward. Soon after that she was accepted and we were told only minimal information. All I knew is that it was filming for a BBC production. 'We spent five days filming. Matilda was a bit of a diva occasionally but she always came around with some bribery of toys and books. 'She even had her own trailer and a rider of green grapes. But we want everyone to know that in real life Julie - or Matilda - is very well and doing fine. She is a little star.'","Matilda Fitt, now 21 months old, played baby Julia Poldark in BBC show .

"Black boxes play a vital role in revealing what happened in the final moments of doomed flights, but not many people know what they actually look like. Photographer Jeffrey Milstein has shot a fascinating project documenting black boxes, shedding light on what happens to the devices   after tragic crashes. Despite the name, the boxes are usually red to help rescuers spot them among the wreckage of crashed planes and helicopters. Scroll down for video . Photographer Jeffrey Milstein has shot a fascinating project documenting black boxes, shedding light on what happens to the devices after tragic crashes . The boxes are often severely burned and damaged in crashes (left), however some are pulled from the wreckage relatively unscathed . Despite the name, the boxes are usually red (right) to help rescuers spot them among the wreckage of crashed planes and helicopters . The boxes, which record flight data and conversations between pilots, are incredibly important for discovering what led to a plane's crash . Mr Milstein's work saw him gain access to air safety storage facilities where data recorders end up following an accident. After disaster strikes, there is an immediate attempt to cover the black box - as seen in recent tragedies such as Germanwings flight 4U 9525. The boxes, which record flight data and conversations between pilots, are incredibly important for discovering what led to a plane's crash, as evidenced by the continuing search for Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 and its flight recorders in the Indian Ocean. Photographer Mr Milstein, from New York, said the boxes were the only way to piece together the cause of a disaster. Mr Milstein's (pictured) work saw him gain access to air safety storage facilities where data recorders end up following an incident . Remarkable: The fascinating photographs document black boxes, and parts of boxes, that have been recovered from aircraft accidents . Mr Milstein said he became interested in black boxes after being asked to take photographs of one after a helicopter crash in Ottawa, Canada . After disaster strikes, there is an immediate attempt to cover the black box - as seen in recent tragedies such as Germanwings flight 4U 9525 . Black boxes have developed throughout the years, becoming stronger to ensure they survive even the most devastating impacts . 'While everyone has heard of the black box, few people have seen one. These photographs document black boxes, and parts of boxes, that have been recovered from aircraft accidents,' he said. 'Some of the earliest boxes used wire, metal foil, or continuous magnetic tape for recording. As technological instruments they are visually fascinating. 'In addition, they are emotionally charged - some crushed, some burnt - they reveal stories of the tragedies that occurred. They may contain the last words of the pilots, and the best hope of understanding and preventing future mishaps. It is hard not to look at some of them without being reminded of our vulnerability.' Mr Milstein said he became interested in black boxes after being asked to take photographs of one after a helicopter crash in Ottawa, Canada. He said: 'When I was shooting the one from the helicopter I noticed there were some others on shelves. Many very old early models or just parts. They allowed me to photograph them. They didn't know what accidents many of the old ones were from. I just photographed them as objects. Older models of black boxes relied on tape and magnetic wire, eventually progressing to tape following technological advances . Mr Milstein carried out his research in Australia as the authorities in the US would not allow him to view wreckage there . Black boxes record flight data as well as conversations in the cockpit of planes, providing an insight into the final moments on board aircraft . 'When back in the US I contacted our Transportation Safety Board (TSB) but they would not allow photographs. One day I read that the black box was invented in Australia. So I ended up going to Canberra and photographing what they had. 'Only a few of the boxes had tags and I didn't try to find out where they all came from and I'm not sure they knew about the old ones. I think a few were not from crashes. 'They told me that they often did the analysis for a large area around there, including Indonesia. Apparently many TSBs return black boxes to the airlines. 'There seem to be a few primary manufacturers. Over the years they used magnetic wire and foil. And magnetic tape which fell into a slot in a box so it wouldn't get stuck on a reel. You can see that on one of the older boxes.'","Fascinating photographs show black boxes salvaged from the wreckage of plane and helicopter crashes .

"Disabled children can face a lot of challenges - but one photographer from Washington wants to make sure they recognize that they all have a super-human ability to conquer any challenge set before them. For The Superhero Project, Renee Bergeron, 38, photographs children with special needs as superheroes, dressing them up with capes, goggles, and wands in order to make them feel like they can do anything. 'I think a lot of people look at others with special needs and think of them as ""less"" in some ways,' Mrs. Bergeron, who also has a parenting blog, recently told The Mighty. 'Let’s face it, though — these kids are all fighters. The obstacles they overcome daily just to cope in our world ought to make us all see them as superheroes.' Caped crusader: Avery, pictured, was photographed for Renee Bergeron's Superhero Project; Avery was born prematurely, has had multiple brain surgeries, and has a feeding tube in her stomach . Powerful shots: Mila, left, suffers from speech disorders, while Mordecai, right, was diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and has several missing fingers and toes . Mrs. Bergeron's first little superhero subject was her own son, Apollo, now four. Apollo was diagnosed with a rare heart defect when he was 18 months old and, in addition to undergoing several medical procedures and surgeries, had to be fitted with a feeding tube at a young age. Despite his health problems and the tube protruding from his stomach, when Apollo was two, Mrs. Bergeron said, he would pose for pictures with 'such strength and confidence'. His mother knew that one day Apollo might feel self-conscious about the tube, so she wanted to document him looking strong and proud, in the hopes that the images might inspire him to feel that way again later on in life. Proud princess: Victoria, pictured, was born with Congenital Femoral Deficiency, which affects her legs, hips, and knees . Super cute: Mrs. Bergeron's son Apollo, left, was her first subject; Melanie, right, is autistic, epileptic, and has Sensory Processing Disorder . After speaking to other moms of children with special needs on Facebook, Mrs. Bergeron decided to take similarly empowering photographs of more disabled children. In 2013, she began working on the The Superhero Project, taking pictures of children with physical disabilities, autism, and sensory disorders free of charge. After Apollo, she photographed Avery, a little girl born prematurely who underwent multiple brain surgeries, Melanie, a four-year-old with autism and epilepsy, and Cody, a red-headed boy with Down syndrome. Tough cookie: Mrs. Bergeron says she 'seriously fell in love with' Cody, pictured, who has Down syndrome, Sensory Processing Disorder, and Speech Apraxia . Watch out, bad guys: Avi, pictured, faces 'a variety of sensory and social challenges', but is still 'vivacious and full of life' 'My hope is that we can spread awareness about special needs, while giving encouragement to families through the gift of professional photography,' she explained on her website. She continued: 'While their special needs are what brought them to the shoot, I wanted the images to capture their individual spirits.' Mrs. Bergeron and her husband, Chuck, also have 13other children, nine of whom are biological and five of whom are adopted. Apollo, born in June 2010, is their youngest child.","Renee Bergeron, 38, captures children with disabilities at their most confident for her Superhero Project .

"A Wisconsin church's four-decade tradition of people mud-wrestling pigs at a summer fundraiser has been cancelled after complaints the animals were 'punched in the face, body slammed and jumped on'. St Patrick's Parish in Stephensville, Wisconsin said in a statement that the Original Pig Rassle will be replaced this  August with a human mud foosball tournament. Global Conservation Group, an animal advocacy group, launched an online petition claiming the tournament was inhumane to the pigs. It garnered more than 81,000 signatures in efforts to cancel the event. Deacon Ken Bilgrien of St Patrick's Parish told Christian Today on Wednesday that the church is moving in a different direction for its 45th annual Roundup, but declined to discuss the controversy surrounding the event. Scroll down for video . St Patrick's Parish in Stephensville, Wisconsin has discontinued its Original Pig Rassle tournament after 44 years of the tradition (above scenes from the event) Global Conservation Group, an animal advocacy group that launched an online petition claiming the tournament was inhumane to the pigs, garnered more than 80,000 signatures in efforts to cancel the event . On August 10, 2014, the church held a 'pig wrestling' event where the animals were 'punched in the face, kicked, body-slammed, yelled at and thrown onto a barrel', according to the Global Conversation Group. 'Wrestling, as a sport, is contested by two human opponents, evenly matched, each of whom enters into the match voluntarily with mutually agreed-upon rules and a common goal,' the group wrote on its website. 'Not so in ""matches"" like pig wrestling, where frightened animals are unwilling participants exploited by teams of humans for entertainment.' The group also accused the church of being in violation of Wisconsin Chapter 951, Crimes Against Animals, which outlaws cockfighting, dog fighting and any other similar fighting between animals or animals and humans, according to its Change.org page. The church announced  in a statement that moving forward the parish's talents could be 'spent in areas that are less controversial'. 'After much prayer and many hours of discussion, we realize that what we had for 44 years in the Original Pig Rassle was memorable, legal and great family fun,' the statement on its website read. The group said during the August 2014 'pig rassle', the pigs were 'punched in the face, kicked, body-slammed, yelled at and thrown onto a barrel' The Wisconsin parish (above) said during its 45th annual Roundup fundraiser this August, the Original Pig Rassle will be replaced with a human mud foosball tournament . Global Conservation Group said they consider the church's decision a victory for their 260-day campaign and consider this a huge step for animal welfare . 'We also realize that our parish and diocesan talents could be better spent in areas that are less controversial. 'It is with great regret that we have discontinued the Original Pig Rassle, we are however, very excited to begin this new tradition at St. Patrick Parish.' Following the news, Global Conservation Group, which protested the church's 'pig rassle' last August, wrote on its Change.org page on April 21: 'This is huge! After 260 days of non-stop campaigning, the church announced today that no further animal abuse events will be held.' 'We're very happy. We consider this a victory for our campaign,' Jordan Turner, Global Conservation Group President told WBAY. 'We're very proud of the church for doing what's right for all involved. And we certainly consider this a huge step for animal welfare.' Biglrien said the church is moving on as they look forward to the new event that will be apart of its annual Roundup this summer. 'You know, we've had problems in the past and this is something new and exciting that we want to do,' he told WBAY.","St Patrick's Parish in Wisconsin said its four-decade tradition, Original Pig Rassle, will be replaced with human mud foosball this summer .

"The Liberal Democrats have admitted they are on course to lose at least 20 MPs, but claim this could still be enough to put them back in power. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Hampshire where the Lib Dems held Eastleigh after Chris Huhne was jailed. But behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Eastleigh in Hampshire . Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats. Instead of battling to win seats across the country, the party has highly targeted strategy, effectively fighting 60 by-elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance. A party source said if the party had a group of MPs numbering 'in the 30s' it could potentially hold the balance of power after May 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government. The senior Lib Dem, closely involved in the party's election strategy, said the campaign's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off. Assessing the election outcome, the source said: 'Everything is so marginal, we need to get into the 30s and the other parties need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is. 'There are now basically two possible outcomes to this election - we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the Lib Dems in it.' Asked if a seat count in the 30s was realistic, the source said: 'Oh yes.' Pressed on whether that was a 'best case' scenario, the senior Lib Dem said: 'I would like to say 150, but I think in fairness you wouldn't believe me. 'There are lots of marginal seats. There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.' Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats . Opinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support,  to barely 8 per cent . The Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats. The Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge. Mr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling. The Lib Dem leader told supporters: 'What we are going to do on May 7 isn't just, as the placards say, win here, we are going to win up and down the country. 'Because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one Eastleigh by-election but 60 Eastleigh by-elections - north, south, east, west, campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory.' He added: 'In the final week of this campaign two million voters will hear our message on Facebook, on YouTube and on social media. 'So we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before. Sixty by-elections up and down the country.' Mr Clegg was all smiles at the Ageas Bowl cricket ground near Eastleigh, behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support. The alternatives to a coalition involving the Lib Dems were a Labour-SNP alliance 'saddling our children with the dead weight of debts from this generation' or a 'hapless David Cameron administration dancing to the tune of Ukip, the DUP and - most chillingly and worryingly of all - his own MPs on the right wing of the Conservative Party'. In a rallying cry delivered at Hampshire County Cricket Club's Ageas Bowl stadium he said: 'If you don't want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right, lurching to the left, the only way to guarantee to keep our country on track is to vote Liberal Democrat. 'We will cut less than the Conservatives, we will borrow less than Labour. We have provided a heart to a government with the Conservatives, just as we would provide a brain to a government with the Labour Party on the economy.' He added: 'We will win again. We will campaign like no other party knows how to campaign again. We will serve our local community better than any other party does again. We will speak to more voters than any other party again.' Asked whether he was now even running a national campaign following his call for '60 Eastleighs', Mr Clegg said: 'I am saying that exactly the same zeal of that by-election is what we are applying in the 60-odd seats where we are fighting tooth and nail to get Liberal Democrats elected in this election.' A new survey by Lord Ashcroft had the Tories on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent . The Tories could be six points ahead of Labour, or three points behind, depending on which opinion poll to believe. The latest batch of surveys agree on only one thing: the result is probably too close to call. David Cameron's day will have been brightened by a six-point lead in a survey by Lord Ashcroft. The Tories are on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent. Another poll by ICM for the Guardian also gave Mr Cameron's party a lead, but of only three points lead on 35 per cent to 32 per cent for Labour. However, the Sun's YouGov poll had Labour in the lead on 34 per cent to the Tories' 33 per cent, indicating that the battle for No 10 remains agonisingly close for the party leaders. Labour enjoyed a three-point lead in a Populus poll, on 36 per cent (up one point) to the Conservatives' 33 per cent (up one). North of the border, a TNS poll found Scottish National Party support continuing to surge to 54 per cent, almost two-and-a-half times Labour's 22 per cent.","Party on course to lose a third of the 57 seats it won in 2010, sources say .

"The wife of broadcaster John Suchet has died aged 73 after a decade-long battle with dementia. Bonnie was described by her husband as 'the love of my life'. She died on April 15. Last night Suchet, 71, declined to comment, saying it was a 'private family matter'. He has thanked those on Twitter who offered their condolences. Bonnie Suchet (pictured with John) was described by her husband as 'the love of my life' The family paid tribute in a death notice in the Telegraph, which read: 'Bonnie died peacefully on 15th April 2015 aged 73.

In recent years the Classic FM DJ and former ITN presenter has been extremely open about his wife's diagnosis, writing a book and becoming honorary president of the Dementia UK charity. In 2009 he broke down live on air during an interview on BBC Breakfast as he gave an account of his wife's battle. He was overcome as he told presenters how his wife had been unaware she had the illness, or that he was on TV talking about it. He added that he sometimes had to beat up a cushion as a way of dealing with his frustration at the loss of the relationship, which he described was 'made in heaven'.

He admitted he had no idea if she knew who he was and said he had to build a life around the changed circumstances, which saw Bonnie being moved into a care home and Mr Suchet moving closer to his brother David for support. The newscaster, who presented bulletins at ITN for 17 years, added that if he chose to wallow in the tragedy of his wife's Alzheimer's disease, then the condition would have claimed another 'victim'.

"A Canadian prostitute says that she wishes  other people wouldn't make her feel so ashamed of working in the sex industry - because she actually really enjoys her job. Celine Bisette, who uses this pseudonym whenever she is discussing her career, insists she is neither 'damaged' nor 'deranged' - that, in fact, she rather enjoys being a prostitute, and it's only the social stigma surrounding her career choice that leaves her feeling unhappy. 'I am embarrassed to be a sex worker, even though I like my job, I’m good at it, and I’ve made exceptional progress in my career over the past few years,' she wrote in a recent essay for xoJane. This pro has pride: Canadian prostitute Celine Bisette, pictured here, wishes other people wouldn't make her feel embarrassed about her job . First, Celine would like everyone to abandon whatever assumptions they've made about prostitutes. She claims that she didn't have an abusive childhood, she's not a 'hyper-sexual nympho', and she isn't uneducated. She had 'an incredibly fortunate upbringing', she said, adding that she got along well with her parents and older sister: '[It was] just about the best any child could possibly hope for.' Then, as a 19-year-old college sophomore, she found herself in need of a way to pay for school. A minimum-wage job wouldn't earn her enough money, and she didn't want to take out student loans. Her best option, she said, was the sex industry. 'I couldn’t bring myself to do porn, and I knew wasn’t talented enough to be a stripper,' she explained. Working as an escort seemed like a natural choice for Celine, as it was easy and it paid well - seeing just one or two clients a week covered her bills. It just didn't occur to her that others might not be so at ease with her decision. In the beginning, she'd readily tell people at parties what she did for part-time work. She was still out-going then, she said, and never felt self-conscious. But peoples' reactions quickly changed the way she approached conversations about her job. They would lecture her, insult her, and accuse her of being a 'traitor to feminism'. One friend told everyone in their social circle that Celine must be mentally unstable to have chosen such a career, and might have even been molested as a child. The rumor took off, and Celine lost a lot of friends in the process. Now, after about a decade in the industry, she is much more reticent about revealing what she does, for fear of eliciting those same negative reactions. But while she has a 'mainstream' part-time job that she uses as a 'cover', she finds it frustrating that she can't be more open. 'I wish I could feel proud of who I am and what I do,' she said. 'I’m tired of feeling embarrassed and ashamed.' Sexy and smart: Celine, who wants to keep her real identity a secret, says she's more than just an escort - she also has her master's degree in sociology . Even when she does tell people about her work as an escort, Celine makes a point to emphasize that she also has a master’s degree in sociology: 'I hype it up and draw attention to it, as if to say, “Yes, I’m a [prostitute], but I’m also smart and normal, really, I promise!”' Because of the social stigma, she sometimes thinks about quitting altogether - but she hesitates because the work is easy, her schedule is flexible, and she makes twice as much as she would doing a job in her field of study. Plus, she explained, she can't erase her history in the sex industry. 'I will always be seen as damaged goods, whether I am a current sex worker or a former one. So I might as well just keep going, right?' In fact, despite liking her job, it's not Canada's ambiguous laws on prostitution that give Celine pause - being paid for sex is legal, but living off that payment of it is not. Rather, it's the negative reactions to her job that make her regret ever taking up sex work at all. 'I wish I’d known what I was getting myself into before I jumped into this line of work,' she said. 'But most of all, I wish I’d never become a prostitute in the first place.'","Celine Bisette, from Canada, became an escort when she was in college .

"Fewer than one in five Massachusetts residents want Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to be executed  believing  a quick death would be 'too easy an escape'. Tsarnaev, who killed three people and injured 260 others in the April, 2013 bombings, is due back in court today where his defence team will begin to make its case. Last week prosecutors  described the 21-year-old as 'America's worst nightmare' insisting he deserves to die for carrying out one of the bloodiest attacks on US soil since 9/11. Fewer than one in five Massachusetts residents believe Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, seen here gesturing at his jail cell camera while awaiting trial, should be handed a death penalty . However a poll for the Boston Globe newspaper found less than 20 per cent of Massachusetts residents questioned believed he should be put to death with 63 per cent in favour of a life sentence. And in the city of Boston itself the figure falls to just 15 per cent of residents in favour of the death penalty and 66 per cent arguing he should be caged for life. Frank Perullo, president of Sage Systems LLC, which conducted the poll on behalf of the Boston Globe said: 'It seems that voters have concluded that Tsarnaev does not deserve a quick death, but rather should spend the remainder of his days in a windowless cell contemplating the heinous acts that put him there. 'To voters, it would seem death is too easy an escape.' If he does escape the death penalty, Tsarnaev is likely to spend the rest of his days in one of America's Supermax prisons where inmates are kept mainly in solitary confinement and have minimal contact with staff or fellow prisoners. Last week protesters demonstrated against the death penalty outside the courthouse holding up banners, one of which read: 'Why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing people is wrong?' Jurors were selected in part for their openness to imposing the death penalty, controversial in a state that has executed no one since 1947 and where Catholic bishops oppose capital punishment. Evidence photos from the Boston Bombing trial revealed the aftermath of the blasts. Three people were killed and  260 others injured in the attacks on April 15, 2013 . An earlier poll carried out by CNN found that just over half of Americans (53 per cent), said Tsarnaev should get the death penalty. Forty-five per cent said he should spend the rest of his life behind bars. If just one juror accepts there were mitigating circumstances to Tsarnaev's actions, then he will be sentenced to life in prison. Tsarnaev has already been convicted of 30 federal charges in the twin bombings  near the marathon's finish line on April 15, 2013. Seventeen of those charges carry the possibility of the death penalty. His defense team is set to begin presenting witnesses today in the penalty phase of his trial - the stage that will determine whether he is executed or spends the rest of his life behind bars. His lawyers' primary task will be to humanize Tsarnaev and undermine prosecutors' depiction of him as a ruthless and heartless terrorist who placed a bomb just feet from a group of children and targeted the marathon for maximum bloodshed. Victim: Last week the court heard how Martin Richard, 8, suffered a slow and painful death . In the trial's first phase, the defense tried to show that at the time of the attacks, Tsarnaev was a 19-year-old college student flunking out of school and heavily influenced by his radicalized older brother, Tamerlan, 26. The defense likely is to continue emphasizing that theme, but may also focus on Tsarnaev's seeming aimlessness to show that he did not appear to be motivated by political concerns and that his brother was the driving force behind the attack, aimed at punishing the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. The witness list has not been made public, but legal experts expect the defense to call family members and friends who will describe Tsarnaev as a well-behaved child who appeared to adjust well to his life in the U.S. after moving here with his parents and siblings from Russia about a decade before the bombings. Among those who have come out against the death penalty are Bill and Denise Richard, whose eight-year-old son Martin was killed and seven-year-old daughter, Jane, lost a leg in the blasts. Writing in the Globe they said: 'We understand all too well the heinousness and brutality of the crimes committed. We were there. We lived it. 'The defendant murdered our 8-year-old son, maimed our 7-year-old daughter, and stole part of our soul. 'We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives.' Last week the trial heard from a trauma surgeon who described how the young Martin Richard suffered terribly before he bled to death on the street. Dr David King, a veteran military combat surgeon, said the little boy was gravely injured in the blasts and suffered 'visceral pain'. King said Martin Richard's liver, spleen and intestines were twisted and stretched by the blast. The surgeon, who works at Massachusetts General Hospital, said Richard's death would have been intensely painful due to the severe injuries to his internal organs. 'He did not die instantaneously,' the surgeon said, noting that internal injuries activate a set of pain receptors that call 'a much more primal, very disturbing kind of pain'. Demonstrators against the death penalty stand outside the Moakley Federal Court during first day of the penalty phase hearing on Tuesday, last week . Jurors were played an audio recording of the reaction of the crowd outside the Forum restaurant between the time of the first and second blasts and heard from some of those who suffered appalling injuries. Heather Abbott, who was one of 17 people to lose a leg, said: 'I saw smoke and started hearing people scream and immediately what came to mind was footage I had seen on 9/11 when the (New York World Trade Center) buildings collapsed... Before I could even react, the second explosion occurred,' Abbott testified. 'I was catapulted through the front doors of the restaurant, which were open, and I landed on the ground in a puddle of chaos and glass and blood.' Abbott was one of 18 people who lost legs to the twin pressure-cooker bombs placed at the scene by Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, who died four days later after the pair shot dead a police officer. The jury saw pictures of all 18 amputees, many of whom testified earlier in the trial, as prosecutors presented the third and final day of their sentencing-phase case in U.S. District Court in Boston. On Tuesday, the court was shown a picture of Tsarnaev flipping off a surveillance camera in his cell three months after his arrest, revealing utter disdain and lack of remorse for the death and destruction he had wreaked .","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, back in court today for start of defence case .

"A pensioner who has visited a beauty spot for 70 years has been banned after she was accused of knocking down the landowner's son with her car. Patricia Wilnecker, 81, fell in love with Lamorna Cove in Cornwall so much on her first visit in 1948 she eventually moved nearby and also wrote a book about it. But she has been told she is no longer welcome there by the owner Roy Stevenson after he accused her of deliberately hitting his son Daniel, 36, during a stand-off at the entrance. He said: 'If she wants to be welcomed back to the cove, she needs to say to Daniel, 'I am very sorry I hit you with my car'. Banned: Patricia Wilnecker, 81, pictured with her dog Shorty, fell in love with Lamorna Cove in Cornwall in 1948 and has gone there every year - but can no longer go after a run-in with the landowner's son . Stand-off: Miss Wilnecker is alleged to have knocked over Daniel, 36, after she had to wait to exit up this private road while he repaired it, a claim she denies . Miss Wilnecker claimed her exit was blocked by Daniel for about ten minutes, while repair work was carried out on the private road leading to it. Mr Stevenson said he banned her after accusing her of aggressively revving her engine before driving into his son and knocking him over. He has said she can come back as long as she says sorry - but the 81-year-old has denied hitting him and claimed the ban has devastated her because the cove is 'my whole life'. She said: 'There was plenty of room to drive past Mr Stevenson perfectly safely but when I tooted my horn, there was a tirade of abuse and I was told I was barred. 'I moved down here from Dorset eight years ago to be closer to the cove. 'I was coming down two or three times a year and then I decided that I may as well move down here - it's my whole life.' From her nearby St Buryan home, she visits the cove three or four times a week, sketching and writing impressions which she uses in a quarterly newsletter distributed around the country. She has also written a book about Lamorna and its surrounding area. Battle of wills: Owner Roy Stevenson told her to stay away after he accused her of knocking over his son Daniel in her car - but says she can return but needs to say sorry first . Mr Stevenson said: 'Miss Wilnecker revved the car and hit my son, knocking him to the ground. 'I am very upset about this - we have known her for a very long time. She used to have a free parking space and she stayed at one of our properties. Over the years we have fussed over her dogs and we used to sell her book in the cafe?. 'However, if she wants to be welcomed back to the cove, she needs to say to Daniel, 'I am very sorry I hit you with my car'. 'We want everyone to enjoy the cove but as owners we live here and we ask people to fit in with us.' Following the incident, both parties contacted the police. Inspector Jean Phillips, from Penzance police, said: 'On attendance we established there were no issues for the police and there is no further involvement by us.'","Patricia Wilnecker has visited Lamorna Cove every year since 1948 .

"A British holidaymaker had to be forcibly removed from a Manchester-bound plane in Egypt after he allegedly threatened to kill other passengers. The plane was minutes away from take-off at the airport in the Red Sea city of Hurghada when an unruly passenger began causing problems near the back of the plane, a witness said. Flight TCX2515 was taxiing to the runway at the time, but was forced to return to its stand, where the man was removed by an armed officer. A witness said the unruly passenger was removed by an armed officer, causing a delay for travellers . Tony Penner, a passenger on the plane, told the Manchester Evening News that the disruptive man punched a bus door and uttered threats as travellers were being driven to the plane on Friday night. Mr Penner, 53, said: ‘He was with his partner who was also unsteady. He started shouting “I’ll kill anybody who gets near me on the plane”. ‘It was a shocking thing to hear. We felt threatened. Then he started punching the bus door. He wasn’t a happy chap.’ The man boarded the plane despite the drama on the bus, and he left passengers feeling nervous after causing more problems on board. The drama unfolded after passengers spent time in the Red Sea tourist resort of Hurghada, Egypt . The captain announced that the plane would return to its stand, and passengers applauded when the man – who had a large build and tattoos – was removed, said Mr Penner. He told the Manchester Evening News: ‘As soon as the steps went down an officer with a pistol came on board. ‘He and the pilot chucked the guy off. He was complaining that everyone was picking on him.’ Passengers were delayed for 40 minutes before the plane departed for Manchester without the man on board. A Thomas Cook Airlines spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: ‘We have a zero tolerance policy towards any behaviour on board affecting the safety and welfare of our crew and customers. ‘We'd like to thank those on board for the patience during the short delay to their flight home.' It was unclear whether the man was detained or charged with a crime, and the airline would not reveal whether the man has been banned from its flights. Thomas Cook referred media to Egyptian authorities and the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. MailOnline Travel has contacted the FCO for comment.","Man left passengers feeling nervous after outburst on bus, said witness .

"David Cameron this morning attempted to explain away how he forgot which football team he supported - by claiming it was because he'd seen another club's ground the day before. The Prime Minister, who insists he has been an Aston Villa fan 'all his life', was giving a campaign speech in south London on Saturday when he joked that everyone should back his team – but then named West Ham instead of the West Midlands giants. An embarrassed Mr Cameron this morning admitted he couldn't explain what happened - but said it must have been because he had been past West Ham's famous Upton Park ground in East London on Friday. It later emerged that the Prime Minister actually flew over the ground in a private helicopter charted to get him back to London quickly after a day's campaigning. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, appearing on ITV's Lorraine this morning, was ridiculed  after  appearing to forget which football team he supported . The Prime Minister tried to explain away his gaffe by saying he had driven by the West Ham stadium the day before . Appearing on ITV's Lorraine, the PM said: 'I had been past West Ham the day before - I can't understand it, but there we are.' But he added: 'I don't think these are the things that determine the election.' A senior Conservative source told MailOnline the PM had not returned to London on Friday on the party's battle bus - but had flown back from Clacton-on-Sea. On Mr Cameron's flight back from Essex - paid for out of Conservative Party funds - he is likely to have passed over the old West Ham ground. Earlier in the day, Mr Cameron had travelled to Lincoln on the train, before jumping on the battle bus for campaign stops in Colchester and Frinton upon Sea. Mr Cameron had earlier insisted he became a Villa fan after watching the team beat Bayern Munich in the European Cup final as a child. But when he was asked what year the match took place or who scored the winner, Mr Cameron refused to answer. The Prime Minister claimed he had been 'overcome by something', adding: 'It was just one of those things.' He said he had gone 'off script' with the remark adding: 'I suppose it's just the campaign. By the time you have made as many speeches as I have on this campaign all sorts of funny things start popping out of your mouth.' An aerial view of Upton Park home of West Ham United Football Club in East London - which Mr Cameron flew over by helicopter on the way back from Clacton, Essex, on Friday afternoon . Mr Cameron has been pictured watching football with his son Elwyn - but admitted that he does not go to live games very often . Mr Cameron  claimed he became a Villa fan after watching the team beat Bayern Munich in the 1982 European Cup final - but admitted he could not remember the year of the triumph. Peter Withe, left, scored the only goal of the match, and Nigel Spinks the reserve 'keeper performed heroics . David Cameron's uncle Sir William Dugdale . David Cameron said he started supporting Aston Villa because his uncle was 'involved in the club'. In fact, the Prime Minister's late uncle Sir William Dugdale was Aston Villa's chairman from 1975 to 1982. In the final year of his chairmanship, Villa beat the odds to win the European Cup. Mr Cameron said he remembered the glory days back in the early 80s'. He said the star players Andy Gray and Brian Little 'got me going'. At the time of the gaffe, Mr Cameron likened himself to the Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, who infamously blamed a 'brain fade' after a disastrous interview. He said: 'I had what Natalie would describe as a brain fade – I don't know what happened to me. I think I was overcome by something. But these things sometimes happen when you're on the stump.' Labour said the gaffe exposed the Prime Minister as a 'phoney'. Former Downing Street spin chief Alastair Campbell claimed it 'says a lot about his character', adding: 'Out of touch. Phoney. Believes nothing.' Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, a Norwich City fan, tweeted: 'Hey David Cameron... I'm off to see that football team I support this afternoon. Name escapes me... they play in yellow... Watford?' But Mr Cameron, interviewed by Sky News host Dermot Murnaghan yesterday, said: 'My uncle was involved in the club and back in the early 80s and all those successes - Andy Gray and Brian Little got me going. 'I don't go very often - in fact I haven't been for years and years - but I do try to keep up. We're going to escape the relegation zone, which we're out of now - and the cup final is very exciting.' Mr Cameron's late uncle Sir William Dugdale was Aston Villa's chairman from 1975 to 1982. Reminded of his comment in 2001 in the House of Commons that he wasn't actually a football fan, Mr Cameron said: 'I mean, I'm not a regular attender, I used to play football as a kid, my son plays football, and I try and sort of keep up with what's happening in the Premier League and see how Villa are doing. 'But when they get snug in the middle of the table I tend to sort of, I tend to back off a bit. When we get close to the bottom I get nervous, but I don't know what happened.' Mr Cameron was asked to show his support for Aston Villa by naming the year of the club's famous European Cup final victory in 1982. The PM said: 'It was early 80s, I'm not going to give you a date because I'll get it wrong.' He added: 'I'm not doing quiz time.' Mr Cameron made the gaffe in a speech on multiculturalism in the UK – claiming it was possible to support a number of teams at the same time and still be British. He said: 'You can support Man United, the Windies and Team GB all at the same time.' But he then added: 'Of course I'd rather you supported West Ham.' Speaking on the Murnaghan programme broadcast yesterday morning, Mr Cameron tried to explain away the gaffe. He said: 'I've been an Aston Villa fan all my life, I literally opened my mouth and I was going off-piste about the fact that in Britain you can be a supporter of the West Indies, a supporter of Manchester United, and a supporter of Team GB.'","David Cameron this weekend forgot which football team he supported .

"The classic denial, 'This old thing?' continues to be used in full force by Australians, according to a new study. A staggering 1.2 million either possess a secret credit card of hide purchases from their partner. According to new research, one in ten cardholders, or an estimated 800,000 Australians, also admit their credit card spending has lead to an argument with a partner. Put it on plastic: A new study of Australians' spending habits reveals that 1.2 million either have a secret credit card or hide purchases from a partner . The study of 1,200 cardholders by Creditcardfinder.com.au found that the biggest culprits of covert credit behaviour are women. 17 per cent will hide their credit card spending, versus 14 per cent of men. It isn't just women keeping mum either, Generation Y (aged 18-34 ) were found to be the least trustworthy of the age categories when it came to their credit card spending. 25 per cent of Gen Y were found to either have a secret credit card or hidden purchases, well above other age groups. This old thing? 17 per cent will hide their credit card spending, versus 14 per cent of men . They were also likely to be the most argumentative about their spending, versus Baby Boomers who had a much clearer concious and weren't likely to hide their spending or argue about it. Crafty card holding habits also varied between states too. Those in New South Wales  were found to argue over their spending more than Western Australians. However, Victorians had the most cunning credit card behaviour with 18 per cent admitting to a secret credit card versus the 9 per cent of Queenslanders. The stats: One in three don’t pay off their bill each month and 96 per cent make at least one unplanned purchase per month . Generational: 25 per cent of Gen Y were found to either have a secret credit card or hidden purchases . Yet, when it comes to spending habits across the board, credit card holders  were found to have a penchant for purchasing over paying back. One in three don’t pay off their bill each month and 96 per cent  make at least one unplanned purchase a month, with shopping sprees being the most common transaction. With the latest Reserve Bank Australia research showing Australians currently owe a net worth of over $50.1 billion across 16 million credit cards, it then comes at no surprise card holders are hiding their  habits.","New survey  analysed Australian credit card habits .

"Quick-thinking: Brady Olson, a teacher at North Thurston High, took down a gunman on Monday . A Washington high school teacher is being hailed a hero for tackling a 16-year-old student to the ground after he opened fire on Monday morning. No one was injured after the boy shot twice toward the ceiling in the school commons before classes began at North Thurston High School in Lacey, about 60 miles southwest of Seattle, authorities said. Brady Olson, who teaches Advanced Placement government and civics at the school, knocked the armed student to the ground and kept him pinned down until authorities arrived, witnesses said. The shooter is in custody at the Lacey Police Station. The teenager, who has not been identified, only transferred to the high school a month ago, according to authorities. He later told police he shot into the air because he didn't want to hurt anyone. A search warrant is being carried out at his home, police said. School district spokesperson Courtney Schrieve confirmed that the 43-year-old teacher had been responsible for helping apprehend the student. 'He is a very brave man who probably saved a lot of people today,' Schrieve told KCPQ. Both students and staff said they were not surprised that Olson, who has taught at the school for nine years, was the one to stop the shooter. 'If anyone in the school were to do something like he did, I would think it would be him,' said student Teia Patan, 17, who is in one of Olson's classes. 'He's one of those people who watch over kids.' Scene: A 16-year-old student walked into the commons, pictured, on Monday with a gun and cigarette and fired two shots at the ceiling, according to witnesses. Mr Olson then tackled the boy to the ground . Fears: Parents and students walk away from North Thurston High School on Monday after a 16-year-old student opened fire before classes at the school and was stopped by a teacher . Patan was swept into a classroom and then escorted out of the building after the shooting. He described his high school as a nice, calm school, with no bullying. 'When it was happening, I first thought it has to be fake,' he added. Another student, 16-year-old Anthony Rybalkin, told the News Tribune that he was in the commons area when the shots were fired. 'I saw (the student) walking down the stairs with a cigarette and gun in his hand,' Rybalkin said. 'I was like, ""This is actually happening"".' He watched as Olson tackled the boy to the ground. He said that another teacher then helped him hold the teenager down. Olson, who is married to an elementary teacher in the school district, Shara Olson, has been teaching for nearly 20 years and has also worked as a former assistant football coach. Scene: No one at the school (pictured) was injured thanks to the quick-thinking of the popular teacher . Safe: Parents hold on to their children after they were released from school on Monday morning . Following his brave efforts at the school, students shared their gratitude on Twitter. 'Thank you so much Mr.Olson for saving so many lives and having the courage to do that,' one wrote. Another added: 'Mr Olson part-time teacher, full-time super hero.' And on her Facebook page, Olson's own mother added: 'So proud of Brady. Not a surprise to any of us that he would be so brave. It was an automatic reaction for him.'","A student walked into North Thurston High School in Lacey on Monday morning with a gun and fired twice at the ceiling .

Meanwhile, corpses continued to line the streets of the city, lying among three-day-old debris still evident from the   tremor which wreaked havoc through the Himalayan region. As the death toll surpassed 4,000, there began to be a desperate shortage of the wood used to build the pyres. Some 250kg of wood is needed for each individual cremation. The areas where cremation rites can take place are also in short supply.

"Kim Kardashian has launched an outspoken attack on President Obama for refusing to use the word 'genocide' as he marked the 100th anniversary of the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians. The reality star said it was 'very disappointing' that he stopped short of using the word - which he had promised to use when he ran for office. Kardashian, whose Armenian heritage comes from her father, the late Robert Kardashian, has used her celebrity since  2011 to bring awareness to the genocide. Marking the anniversary of the mass murder at the weekend, Kardashian wrote in an op-ed in Time magazine: 'I would like President Obama to use the word ""genocide"". It’s very disappointing he hasn’t used it as President. 'We thought it was going to happen this year. I feel like we’re close — but we’re definitely moving in the right direction. ' Scroll down for video . Kim and Khloe Kardashian laid flowers at the Dzidzernagapert Armenian genocide monument’s eternal flame during their April 10 visit. Marking the anniversary of the mass murder last weekend, Kim Kardashian wrote in an op-ed, 'I would like President Obama to use the word “genocide.” It’s very disappointing he hasn’t used it as President' Tricky language: President Barack Obama sent an administration official to Armenia to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1915 massacre by Ottoman Turks. But he refused to call the mass killings of ethnic Armenians a 'genocide' for fear of offending ally Turkey . Slaughter: Historians estimate that 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks during World War I. Above, Armenians are made to march in this picture from the 1915 massacre . Kim and Khloe walk in the plaza at the Armenian Genocide Memorial. They were accompanied by their cousins Kara and Kourtni and Kim's husband Kanye West. Kim and Khloe's  Armenian heritage comes from their father, the late Robert Kardashian . As a senator and presidential candidate, Obama did describe the killings of Armenians as genocide. But he has never used that description since taking office, mainly out of deference to Turkey, a key U.S. partner. The White House said U.S. officials pledged to Armenian-American leaders that the U.S. would use last week's 100th anniversary of the killings 'to urge a full, frank and just acknowledgement of the facts,' but a statement about the meeting did not include the word 'genocide.' Historians estimate up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks, an event widely viewed by scholars as a genocide. Turkey, however, denies that the deaths constituted genocide because it was not an ethnic-driven battle and says the death toll has been inflated. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff also said he was 'deeply disappointed' by the president's decision. 'The United States has long prided itself for being a beacon of human rights, for speaking out against atrocity, for confronting painful chapters of its own past and that of others,' said Schiff. 'This cannot be squared with a policy of complicity in genocide denial by the president or Congress.' Kardashian, who recently traveled to the country for the first time with her husband Kanye West, sister Khloe and cousins Kara and Kourtni Kardashian, said, 'Now is the time to speak out, and every little bit helps' 'I will continue to ask the questions and fight for the genocide to be recognized for what it was,' the reality television star said, encouraging Turkey to label the killings as a genocide. 'It’s not the fault of the people who live there now, ' she noted, and 'I think if they recognize it and acknowledge it, everyone can move on. 'I believe in moving on and looking toward a brighter future, but you can’t move on unless you acknowledge the past. To not do so is an act of disrespect.' Paying their respects: Kim has used her celebrity status to bring awareness to the genocide since at least 2011. The Pope has also called the slaughter 'the first genocide of the 20th century' Kim and Kanye are pictured here with daughter North West and Khloe as they walk inside church hallways to view art prior to baptism in at Cathedral of Sts. James in the historic Armenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem last year for Norrie's christening . Kardashian recalled in the op-ed that her family tree would have ended if her grandparents hadn't left Armenia for Los Angeles the year before the armed conflict. 'There are so many people who lost their families, and the stories of how they were killed are so heartbreaking—they should never be forgotten,' she wrote. 'The whole point of remembering the genocide is to make sure it doesn’t happen again. A million-and-a-half people were brutally massacred, and a country can just pretend like it never happened? I don’t think that’s right.' While in Armenia, Kardashian and her family visited the Dzidzernagapert Armenian Genocide monument’s eternal flame that honors those countryman who were killed in 1915. 'An emotional day at the genocide museum,' read a tweet posted by Kim that was accompanied by a photo of her and Khloe laying flowers at the flame. Kardashian has been publicly calling for the deaths to be recognized as a genocide since 2011, when she wrote in a blog post, 'Every year, I honor the memory of the martyrs who were killed during the 1915 Armenian Genocide. Even though so many countries around the world recognize the Genocide, the government of Turkey still denies it. 'It happened before Rwanda, Darfur, and the Holocaust. Maybe none of those other genocides would have happened if more nations had condemned the Armenian Genocide, when 1.5 million Armenians were massacred.' During their trip to her ancestors' homeland, Kim, Khloe and their cousins met with the country's Prime Minister, Hovik Abrahamyan, who 'expressed how proud they are that we are proud Armenians and we have not forgotten our roots!' Kim said in a tweet. Kim's husband Kanye also threw an impromptu bash and free concert in Yerevan at Swan Lake before departing Armenia for Jerusalem, Israel - the location of their daughter's christening at an Armenian church in 2014. The Kardashians also visited the Geghard Monastery during their trip to Armenia . Khloe wrote in a tweet on the day of their visit to the genocide memorial: 'My sister and I are trying to bring awareness not only to our Armenian genocide but genocides and human slaughter, in general. Knowledge is power!' 'The Kardashians have helped strike a powerful blow at Turkey's campaign of genocide denial,' ANCA communications director told ABC News after the visit. Their trip to Armenia 'has helped shine a global spotlight' on the genocide and 'the need for justice for that crime with millions,' she said. Khloe also kept the campaign going after she returned home, asking her fan base on Twitter to sign a Change.org petition 'to bring awareness to the Armenian genocide' by requesting that Google highlight the conflict with its homepage doodle on the anniversary of the killings, April 24. 'I did!!!' she said. As of Friday  the online petition had garnered more than 202,129 supporters, beating its goal of 200,000 names. Google did not wade in the controversy by adopting the suggested doodle, however. The White House said last week that while it understands the perspective of those hoping to hear different language from Obama this year, the administration believes its approach is right, 'both for acknowledging the past, and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present.' It announced at the same time that Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew would attend a ceremony in Armenia on Friday making the anniversary. 'President Obama's surrender to Turkey represents a national disgrace,' Armenian National Committee of America Chairman (ANCA) Ken Hachikian said in a statement. 'It is, very simply, a betrayal of truth, a betrayal of trust.' The Pope added his name this year to the list of high-profile leaders characterizing the 1915 slaughter as the 'first genocide of the 20th Century.' He further proclaimed that 'concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it.' Ties that bind: The Kardashian family tree that traces back to two Molokan Armenian families . Home: Kim Kardashian's ancient ancestors fled the Armenian village Karakale (pictured recently) to escape a prophecised genocide that DID come to pass . Genocide: The village of Karakale (pictured in the 19th Century) was among hundreds destroyed as the Ottoman Empire laid waste to the region. Residents - possibly including the Kardashians - can be seen standing by their traditional houses . Disputed: Armenian lands (in red) were disputed just after the turn of the 20th Century, with bloody consequences . Armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the Ottoman Empire was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide. Turkey rejects the claims, arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians and as many Turks died in civil strife when Armenians rose up against their Ottoman rulers and sided with invading Russian troops. The fundamental division was religious. Armenians are Christians, while Turks are Muslims. The two groups had lived alongside each other for hundreds of years, but the Ottoman Turks had always been on top. As Ottoman rule crumbled, rival nationalisms arose, and the Russian Empire - itself to experience revolution in 1917 - also invaded. Armenians say they were forced from their homes, marched to mass graves and slaughtered. Some managed to flee south into modern-day Syria and the Levant, others to Russian-held land which is now modern-day Armenia. Hundreds of thousands met a violent end or died as they fled. The outcome in terms of mass death is not now widely disputed. But the use of the word 'genocide' is hugely controversial, as Turkey - successor to the Ottoman empire, and with a huge majority of Muslim ethnic Turks - rejects the description. Armenia, which became a fully-fledged nation in its modern form at the collapse of the Soviet Union, has campaigned for recognition of its description of the deaths. Its modern borders are much smaller than the areas where the deaths occurred. The province of Kars (above), where the Kardashians' roots - and the origin of their name - lies, is almost entirely in Turkey. Its capital, Kars, is now a symbol of the division over the deaths between the two countries: it sits on the border but the frontier is closed.","In 1915, 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks in what historians have described as the first genocide of the 20th century .

"A nurse who faced surgery to treat breast cancer at the hospital where she worked discovered just days later that she'd never had the disease. A mix-up at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton meant staff confused the notes of three patients. As a result, Elizabeth Dawes was wrongly told in July 2013 that she had invasive grade three breast cancer following a biopsy. Doctors advised the 39-year-old that she needed immediate surgery, suggesting a double mastectomy. Ms Dawes refused, but did undergo major surgery to remove a 'cancerous' tumour from her right breast as well as lymph nodes from her armpit. Elizabeth Dawes, 39, was told she had breast cancer in July 2013. Doctors at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton told her she needed immediate surgery and chemotherapy. But four days after the operation she was told staff had confused her medical notes with those of other patients, and she'd never had cancer . The mother-of-one was also told she would need a further procedure to correct 'deformities' to her breasts caused by the first operation. But four days later, Ms Dawes was asked to attend an appointment with her consultant. There, he revealed there had been a mix-up with her hospital notes and those of two other patients, - and she had, in fact, never had the disease. She said: 'I am absolutely appalled at what I have been through and am still struggling to comprehend how this could even happen. 'To be told you are facing aggressive cancer in your 30s is devastating and of course, I feared the worst and began making plans for my child, and getting my finances in order.' 'I was willing to undergo whatever treatment it took to fight the cancer so when I was told I needed surgery, I didn't think twice.' Ms Dawes was so traumatised she needed anti-depressants and was forced to give up her job in the oncology department at New Cross Hospital. , added: 'The doctor also told me I would need a bilateral breast lift to cosmetically improve the shape of my breasts, as otherwise, after having the cancer surgery I would be left deformed. 'I was very sore after the operation and shocked by the extensive scaring, so to be recalled four days later to be told none of it was necessary was truly horrendous. 'I am still in pain now, have lost a lot of sensation in my breasts and the scarring has not improved, which hugely affects my self-confidence. 'Nothing can make up for what has happened but I am determined to see justice done and feel I at least deserve an official apology from the Trust given the huge impact this has had on my life.' Ms Dawes, who has an 18-year-old son, is taking legal action. The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, which operates the hospital, has admitted liability for the misdiagnosis and the unnecessary surgery performed. The mother-of-one, who was working as a breast cancer care nurse at the same hospital at the time, said: 'To be told you are facing aggressive cancer in your 30s is devastating and of course, I feared the worst and began making plans for my child, and getting my finances in order' Lawyer Louise Hawkley, of Irwin Mitchell, said: 'This is a truly shocking case that has left Elizabeth appalled at the unnecessary heartache, and extensive scarring she has suffered as a result of being wrongly told that she had breast cancer. 'There are also very serious patient safety concerns about the ""mix-up"" and how the other patients have potentially been affected too.' She said aside from the 'obvious physical implications', the ordeal has had 'a devastating impact' on her client's life. Ms Dawes had worked as a breast care nurse in the Oncology Department at New Cross Hospital but has since found herself unable to continue in her role 'as a consequence of what she has been through'. Ms Hawkley added: 'It is also vital that the Trust identifies what improvements can be made to ensure that this never happens again to improve patient safety at the hospital.' A trust spokesman told MailOnline it has apologised to Ms Dawes and carried out a full investigation. He said: 'The medical director and nurse director met with Ms Dawes to offer her an unreserved apology for this terrible error and inform her of the trust’s investigation into the incident. 'The findings of the investigation were shared with Ms Dawes and a further apology offered at that time. 'The incident is now part of an ongoing legal claim with which the trust is co-operating fully. 'The trust can confirm that no other patient received inappropriate treatment as a result of this incident.' The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, which operates the hospital, has admitted liability and a spokesman said an apology had been issued to Ms Dawes. He added no other patient received inappropriate treatment .","Elizabeth Dawes was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2013 .

"Candle entrepreneur Jo Malone has joined 5,000 small business bosses praising the Tories' as the 'only people' who can keep the economy secure . Perfume entrepreneur Jo Malone has joined 5,000 small business bosses praising the Tories as the 'only people' who can keep the economy secure. In a major boost to the Conservatives' lacklustre campaign, the signatories - who together employ nearly 100,000 people - said they 'would like to see David Cameron and George Osborne given the chance to finish what they have started'. Ms Malone, one of the most high-profile names to sign the letter, this morning claimed a Labour government would 'jeopardise' the economic recovery. Appearing on Sky News, Ms Malone said she had sold her business to cosmetics giant Estee Lauder in 2006, but had 'started all over again' by setting up a new business three years ago. The new candle and fragrance business, called Jo Love, now employs 14 people she said. But Ms Malone claimed Labour were a risk to all small businesses like hers. She said: 'The world is looking at us as a really strong economy again. Its working, and people's lives are coming back together and jobs are being created, why would we jeopardise that? 'I've never put my head above the parapet in politics but I feel so passionately and so strongly this time that I do have to say something. And this is my voice I'm not representing anyone but myself and my business. 'With 10 days to go and from what I've seen I'm afraid my vote is not going to go to Ed Miliband it's going to David Cameron and I'm going to support them and I'm going to speak out because I believe this economy is on a very secure footing.' It comes as Mr Cameron attempts to move the arguments of the election campaign onto Britain's economic recovery. In a major boost to the Prime Minister - pictured in central London this morning - 5,000 businesses said they 'would like to see David Cameron and George Osborne given the chance to finish what they have started' Mr Cameron launched the Conservatives' small business manifesto this morning - promising to make Britain the best place in Europe to set up a company . The Tories' small business launch suffered an embarrassing blow this morning after one of the firms which apparently put its name to a letter in support of David Cameron withdrew its support – claiming it never signed it. Aurum Solutions has been removed from the letter  after saying its sales director did not sign it and that the company's policy is to remain 'politically unaligned'. The company asked for its name to be taken off the letter, tweeting: 'Our Sales Director did not sign the letter in support of the Conservative Party. Please remove signatory 413 immediately.' Aurum Solutions managing director Helen Belcher claimed that sales director Steve O'Hehir was sent an email by the Tories, then clicked on a link within it, but did not enter any details. But the Tories said all the signatories had to actively enter their details on the party website. A party spokesman said: 'Everyone whose name was published actively signed up to the letter on the Conservative Party's website.' The letter to the Telegraph states: 'We run small businesses right across the country. We work hard, make sacrifices and invest our own money to help our businesses grow and succeed. 'It was tough during the recession, but we kept going. This Conservative-led Government has been genuinely committed to making sure Britain is open for business. 'They've managed to get the economy moving again by tackling the deficit, helping to keep interest rates low and inflation down. We've been helped by their steps to lower taxes, reduce red tape, simplify employment law and get the banks lending.' A change to a Labour government the letter warns 'would be far too risky and would undo all the good work of the last 5 years'. The letter is designed to challenge Labour claims that the Tories only support big businesses. It was organised by Karren Brady, the star of the Apprentice and Tory peer and comes as the party today launches its small business manifesto. Baroness Brady said: 'Ed Miliband and his team don't really get what it is to run a business.' Writing in the Telegraph, she added: 'If Labour got into government and started wrecking our economy again, many more businesses would struggle and jobs would be lost. 'It doesn't bear thinking about. David Cameron and the Conservatives have a clear plan for this country which is already taking us in the right direction.' Mr Cameron appeared on ITV's  'Lorraine' this morning, with just a week and a half until polling day on May 7 . Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna last night insisted Labour would be better for small businesses. He said: 'The Tories have spent five years letting down Britain's small businesses. Government scheme after government scheme designed to boost finance for small firms has failed, and small business lending has fallen by £500m in the last three months. 'With Labour, the tax burden on small firms will be lower than under the Tories who have overseen an increase in business rates of around £1,500. 'Labour's Better Plan will cut - then freeze - business rates, set up a Small Business Administration and a proper British Investment Bank to back small businesses. And only Labour will tackle late payment and the unfair treatment of small suppliers we've seen under the Tories.'","Bosses of over 5,000 small businesses sign a letter praising the Tories .

"A mother says she must quit her job after her daughter was refused a place at a junior school 150 yards from their front door - and sent to one more than two miles away instead. Seven-year-old Charlotte Briggs was told she cannot attend Lydgate Junior School in Sheffield even though she can see it from her bedroom window. Her mother Lynne, 49, who has two other children, claims taking her daughter to school and back every day would require four hours of travelling on the bus and force her to quit her job. Unhappy: Charlotte Briggs, seven, was refused a place at a school 150 yards from her home and offered one two miles away, so her mother Lynne, pictured together,  must quit her job to ensure she gets there and back . Decision: The schoolgirl leaves across the street from her preferred school but instead will have to head to Shooters Grove Primary, which is around two miles away . Mrs Briggs had believed Broomhill Infants School in Sheffield, where Charlotte is a student, was a feeder school to Lydgate Junior, so only put one school on Charlotte's admission form. The mother - who works in IT for Sheffield City Council and is married to financial planner Simon, 55, - also believed the short distance from her home to the school would also be a deciding factor. But the council said the school Charlotte attends has never been a feeder school and advised parents to always submit three preferences when applying. Charlotte is in the catchment area but the school is oversubscribed, so children who also live in the area but go to the correct feeder school were given a place above her. Mrs Briggs is now planning to appeal the decision made by the authority after Charlotte was given a spot at Shooters Grove Primary - more than two miles away. She said: 'I know that lots of parents are in similar positions but what is different here is that not only are we in catchment, we live about as close to the school as possible. Rejected: Charlotte Briggs was refused a place at Lydgate Junior School (above) in Sheffield, even though she can see it from her bedroom window . 'Parents park outside our house when dropping their children off at Lydgate Juniors. 'The council uses an ""as the crow flies"" criteria for working out who lives nearer in the event of over subscription within catchment and if I look out of my landing window, all that stands between us and the school are the Kings Court OAP flats and a couple of houses. 'I've been told Broomhill is no longer a feeder school and all the places have been allocated at other infant schools. 'I have looked at bus timetables. I wouldn't be able to drop Charlotte off at school and get into town for work. It would take an hour and five minutes each way twice a day. I simply wouldn't be able to do it.' Jayne Ludlam, the council's executive director of children, young people and families said: 'We do understand that it is difficult if a child cannot be offered a place at their preferred school. 'We always encourage parents to submit three preferences in case their first preference cannot be accommodated. Alternative: The seven-year-old was instead offered a place at Shooters Grove - more than two miles away . 'Broomhill Infant School is not and has never been a linked feeder school to Lydgate Junior School and a member of the Admissions Team attended Broomhill in October 2014 to offer help and advice to parents before applying. 'If only one preference is submitted and cannot be accommodated, a place may have to be offered at the nearest school with available places. This may be a school outside the catchment area, if no other preferences were requested. 'If a family has specific reasons for seeking a place at an oversubscribed school they can submit an appeal to the independent appeals panel, which will convene in June and July.' Mrs Briggs said she has contacted her local prospective parliamentary candidates in Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's constituency of Sheffield Hallam - but has yet to receive a reply. She added: ‘The school she has been allocated is down into one valley and down the other side. It's ridiculous. If we were to go by bus it would be a bus into town and then another one out. ‘It would take an hour and five minutes to get to school. We are appealing the decision but we won't find out until July what the outcome is, which is very late for us to plan and buy uniforms.’","Lynne Briggs only applied for one school  because it is only 150 yards away .

"Why buy a fishing boat, when you can make one out of household furniture? Auckland coastguards have had the shock of their life after receiving an alert that about 5 homemade 'boats' were taking part in an annual fishing event on Sunday. The attendees included a couch strapped to a stack of tyres and a floating Subaru car. Scroll down for video . Auckland coastguards received unusual call out to a homemade boat race that saw aSubaru take to the water . The race also saw a couch strapped to a few tyres and being pulled along by a dingy . Coastguards took to the water near Gulf Harbour, off Auckland's Whangaparaoa Peninsula after receiving a call out about the event from a member of the public. One vessel capsized just outside of the harbour, causing three people to have a bit of a paddle, however no one was injured. The voluntary rescue unit, Hibiscus Rescue and North Shore Rescue lent a hand to the fishermen as alcohol appeared to be involved during the event. Coastguard Hibiscus took to their Facebook to post their surprise at the unique vessels. 'These guys and gals were having a great time today!' they wrote. 'It was great to see everyone wearing lifejackets! Not sure who won the fishing comp?' A video was also released by the coastguard showing two men on a dodgy dingy being transported back to the shore. Hibiscus Rescue and North Shore Rescue lent a hand to the fishermen as alcohol appeared to be involved . One vessel capsized outside of the harbour, however besides getting a bit wet, no one was injured .

According to the New Zealand Herald, the event has been happening for years and is aimed to spread positivity through the community. An attendee who asked not to be named said that safety was always paramount and the strong winds at Army Bay were monitored. 'It's all about people building boats. These guys have spent a year restoring boats and we've had a lot of positive feedback from the community. It's 100 per cent positive,' he said. 'We're just locals, just mates, having a good time.'

"Former captain of the fictional Star Trek Enterprise, William Shatner has proposed a radical method to solve California’s ongoing drought disaster. He is planning to run a Kickstarter campaign and is hoping to raise $30 billion (£20 billion) to build a pipeline from Seattle to bring water to the state. But the proposal to build a pipeline hundreds of miles long has been declared 'highly illogical' by some experts. Scroll down for video . Former captain of the fictional Star Trek Enterprise, William Shatner (pictured) has revealed radical proposals in an interview with Yahoo News. He wants to build a 4ft-wide pipeline from Seattle down to California to transport water and solve the state's ongoing drought problem . He revealed the crowdfunding campaign in an interview with David Pogue from Yahoo News. Mr Shatner likened his project to a similar pipeline in Alaska - with, in this case, the pipeline running from Seattle to California down the I-5 highway. Since the year 2000, seven western states in the US has seen their driest periods in centuries: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. And scientists in California have warned that the region may be experiencing a century-long 'mega-drought'. The warnings came after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580, and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years. In 2013, California received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850. And the last four years have seen the worst conditions, with the entire state of California now declared to be experiencing a drought. The pipeline would reportedly be used to fill one of the rapidly drying lakes in California. He said Seattle was ‘a place where there’s a lot of water’ - although its state, Washington, is also experiencing a major drought. Without going into specifics, Mr Shatner added he would need a ‘large, four-foot pipeline’ above ground to keep enough water flowing. On his website though, Shatner’s Water, he is letting people suggest other ideas for what to do with the money - if the campaign is successful. If he doesn’t get the funding he requires, Mr Shatner says he will give the money he raises to a politician. However, Kickstarter doesn’t allow campaigners to keep any money if they don’t reach their target, so Mr Shatner may need to use a site such as Indiegogo instead, which does. The funding campaign has not yet launched and cynics have suggested that the proposal was tongue-in-cheek, or may have been a joke. On Twitter, Mr Shatner responded to some of these comments by posting: ‘I know I need experts and @algore and @elonmusk should be asked to weigh in and join the conversation,’ he said. And responding to complaints that Washington was also experiencing a severe drought, he said: ‘I think [Washington] folks are thinking I’m coming in with football field sized sponges in the middle of the night to steal their water.’ The ongoing drought is one of California's worst in history. The last four years have seen the worst conditions, with the entire state of California now declared to be experiencing a drought said the US Department of Agriculture. This graphic shows the areas that have been hit the worst . Without going into specifics, Mr Shatner said he would need a ‘large, four-foot pipeline’ above ground to keep enough water flowing. On his website Shatner’s Water, he is also letting people suggest other ideas for what to do with the money - if the campaign is successful. One of the alternative proposals is pictured . California has had to drastically cut back on water use to deal with the four-year drought that continues to cause devastation. But the Washington Department of Ecology spokesman Dan Partridge said that Mr Shatner’s plan was not necessarily the solution they needed. ‘Frankly we found it highly illogical, to put it in “Star Trek” terms,’ he said. ‘This would involve so many obstacles, so many hurdles that it would have to overcome to become reality. ‘Namely the water of Washington state, you have to acquire a number of rights to use that water and we would not be approving transfer of a huge volume of water out of our state at this point in time when we have a drought of our own to deal with.’ Bone dry: A Californian farmer is pictured surveying his drought-hit land in San Luis Obispo County .","Mr Shatner revealed his radical proposal in an interview with Yahoo News .

"Lord Janner sent a ‘thank you’ Christmas card to a detective after learning he would escape child sex abuse charges, it emerged yesterday . Lord Janner sent a ‘thank you’ Christmas card to a detective after learning he would escape child sex abuse charges, it emerged yesterday. The officer said he was appalled by the Labour peer’s note after his superiors forced him to drop his inquiries into Janner’s alleged sex abuse. The note thanked him for how he had dealt with the issue, and even invited him and his wife to dinner at Parliament. The revelation of Janner’s apparent attempt to influence the police came amid fresh concerns about the Establishment cover-up of the Labour grandee’s alleged paedophilia. Detectives have carried out four child sex inquiries into Janner since 1991, but attempts to bring him to justice were repeatedly blocked. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders announced earlier this month that he should been have charged on each occasion. But she went on to rule that the 86-year-old peer should not face prosecution because of his dementia. The decision has caused outrage – with critics pointing out that he signed letters in the House of Lords as recently as this month, and had held numerous dinners and events in Parliament since being diagnosed in 2009. It has also been revealed that Mrs Saunders was a pupil at the same legal chambers as Janner – although she claims she never met him. The furore over her decision grew yesterday as it emerged that: . The policeman who led the original investigation into Janner in the early 1990s spoke yesterday of how he was ‘gutted’ after orders to drop the case came ‘from the very top’. Retired Detective Inspector Kelvyn Ashby, of Leicestershire Police, said his team uncovered evidence supporting allegations that the then-Leicester MP used his home and a hotel to abuse a teenage boy. He said he and fellow investigator Mick Creedon, now Chief Constable of Derbyshire Police, were prevented from arresting Janner. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders ruled that the 86-year-old peer should not face prosecution because of his dementia . ‘Someone higher up told us that we couldn’t just arrest an MP and it went no further. We were told that by someone senior, who I can’t name, but the order had to have come from the very top. I’m sure my bosses’ hands were tied,’ he told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I was extremely frustrated. Janner should have been arrested. He was treated differently because he was an MP.’ Mr Ashby, 65, added: ‘The bit that really got me was that I later got a Christmas card in the post from Greville Janner. ‘The card was an official House of Commons Christmas card and was handwritten. Retired Detective Inspector Kelvyn Ashby, of Leicestershire Police, received a thank you note from Janner . ‘It said something like “I was very pleased with the way you treated me” and invited me and my wife for a dinner at the House of Commons. I couldn’t believe it. My wife was disgusted, as was I. Needless to say we never replied and never went.’ The decision not to charge Janner in 1991 was taken just weeks after Sir Allan Green quit as Director of Public Prosecutions when he was caught kerb crawling in King’s Cross in London. His deputy David Gandy took over temporarily until a full-time replacement was appointed the next year. But Mr Gandy, 83, yesterday said he could not remember seeing Janner’s case file. He told The Daily Mail: ‘I have no knowledge of it whatsoever. It may well be the decision was taken by someone else in the department or it could have been sent out for senior counsel to make a decision on. Whatever happened I simply don’t have any knowledge of it.’ Even Janner’s barrister, the late George Carman QC, who was instructed to defend him after the abuse allegations became public in 1991, was astonished that he escaped prosecution. His son Dominic Carman said: ‘My father was surprised that Janner was not charged. ‘He suspected there may have been some attempt to influence the decision by the DPP, although there was no proof.’ Investigative website Exaro said the four experts who examined the peer had not all agreed on the six key points about the nature and extent of his illness outlined in Mrs Saunders’s statement on why she was not going to charge him. Janner’s family have issued a statement insisting he is ‘entirely innocent of any wrongdoing’. Lawyers for Janner’s alleged victims could demand medical tests to check the extent of his dementia. Child abuse campaigners have questioned how the former Labour MP was able to sign a letter to the House of Lords on April 9, just a week before prosecutors said he would not face charges because of his deteriorating dementia. Now it has emerged that Janner could be examined by experts as part of compensation claims brought by his alleged victims. Richard Scorer, of law firm Slater and Gordon, told the Observer: ‘I have certainly dealt with civil claims before where the alleged abuser has claimed to have dementia, and we have been able to have them medically examined in relation to that.’","Janner sent the card to detective after learning he would not be charged .

On Everest, survivors described running for their lives as a ‘tsunami’ of snow and ice triggered by tremors descended on Base Camp. Up to 18 were killed and more than 60 injured when the 7.8-magnitude quake set off a huge avalanche on the world’s highest peak. Survivors described seeing tents with climbers still inside picked up and tossed across the camp before crashing down into rocks and ice. Scroll down for video . Icy terror: An avalanche appears to erupt in a cloud of snow and debris as it tears towards Everest Base Camp, where it ripped through tents with climbers still inside . As the freezing cascade tore down the mountainside in a terrifying explosion of snow and ice, a photographer captured the dramatic moment it headed straight for the camp at 17,700ft (5,380m). Aftershocks set off a series of further avalanches, prompting fears for the Britons among the hundreds of climbers left stranded by the tonnes of debris and ice blocking their routes. In Kathmandu and Pokhara, bodies lay among the rubble as buildings were reduced to matchsticks and tent cities were erected to provide shelter for the hundreds of thousands left homeless. Rescuers dug victims out from the ruins of collapsed buildings – some with their bare hands – while aid agencies warned of a humanitarian disaster and said the death toll could be far higher in more remote areas. At least 65 Britons across the region were unaccounted for last night. Everest suffered its deadliest ever day on Saturday when the avalanche struck. Google executive Daniel Fredinburg, 33, medic Marisa Eve Girawong, 28, and documentary-maker Tom Taplin, 61, were among the dead, as were several Nepali workers and sherpas. Around 1,000 people, including 400 foreigners were believed to have been on Mount Everest when the quake struck. Fears grew for their safety as survivors described how avalanches had left them stranded on the mountain, with their descent paths blocked by debris. Base Camp was said to have borne the worst of the avalanche’s impact and mountaineer Alex Gaven tweeted that it looked like it had been hit by a ‘nuclear blast’. Others described seeing ‘car-sized boulders’ and a ‘50-storey building of white’ as the avalanche thundered towards them.

Devastation: The scene as Base Camp after the freezing cascade tore down the mountainside . A rescue helicopters lifts survivors from the mountainside, as many climbers were left stranded by the avalanche . The 7.8-magnitude quake struck on Saturday and a 6.7-magnitude aftershock hit yesterday, leaving survivors afraid to return home. Landslides hampered rescue efforts and hospitals warned they could not cope with treating the injured. Although Nepal bore the brunt of the death toll, the quake claimed lives in India, Tibet and Bangladesh. Nepal is one of the world’s poorest countries and an international appeal began for aid, with Britain pledging £5million. David Cameron said the RAF would fly supplies into the region today after the UK sent search and rescue teams and medics yesterday. British climber Nick Talbot, who was in the same group as Google executive Mr Fredinburg, told of the terrifying moment the avalanche hit ‘like a tsunami’.

This mound of rubble is all that remains of a temple after the earthquake struck in Kathmandu . ‘I saw this wall of snow and ice coming. I ran away. I thought, “There is no chance I can get away”. I just had my socks on. ‘It knocked me into the rocks. I got up and it knocked me over again.’ Mr Talbot, 39, from County Durham, was attempting to become the first climber with cystic fibrosis to make the ascent. He suffered cracked ribs and was evacuated by helicopter. His US campmate Mr Fredinburg suffered fatal head injuries. US filmmaker Mr Taplin, who also died was making a documentary about Base Camp. His wife Corey Fryer said he died ‘doing what he loved’. Nepali cook Bhim Bahadur Khatari described digging himself out of the avalanche, saying: ‘A huge wall of snow just piled on me. ‘I managed to dig out of what could easily have been my grave. I wiggled and used my hands as claws to dig as much as I could. I was suffocating, I could not breathe. But I knew I had to survive.’ The International Red Cross and Google both launched websites to help families searching for news of the missing. Survivor: Laura Wood, 23, from Huddersfield has made contact with her family . Among the 65 Britons still listed as missing by the Red Cross are Samuel Bond, 28, from Doynton, South Gloucestershire, Ashrafe Sultana, 31, from North London, and Keith Diplock, 71, from East Sussex. Others feared missing have made contact with their families, including Tara Bradshaw, 24, from Brighton, Laura Wood, 23, from Huddersfield, Sebastian Lovera, 22, from Tonbridge, Kent, and Sophie Proffitt, 23, from Kidlington, Oxford. Julia Carroll, 22, managed to get a Facebook message to her mother Denise in Boxford, Suffolk, saying simply: ‘I’m alive.’ Sheffield-based adventure company Jagged Globe said it had contacted seven of its eight teams in the Everest region. It said its remaining group of 13 people was in a remote area and may not be aware of the earthquake. Alexandra Aitken, the daughter of former Conservative MP Jonathan Aitken, was in Nepal but has made contact with her family to say she was unhurt. Peter Hillary, the son of Everest pioneer Sir Edmund Hillary, was trekking near the peak when the quake struck but was also unharmed. A climber at Camp 1, named only as Sean, gave a graphic description of the terrifying situation faced by those stranded. In a series of messages relayed through a climbing group on Twitter, he said: ‘It’s so unstable now that rock fall and minor avalanches occur consistently. The circumstances we face are dire. As I lie here writing this, the ground is moving beneath me. My heart leaps every time the earth moves. I can’t get used to it.’ Meanwhile chaos broke out in Kathmandu as passengers attempted to fight their way into the international airport in a bid to leave the country. In the capital, centuries of history were destroyed in minutes when the quake damaged the Dharahara Tower and historic temples in Durbar Square. Oxfam, Christian Aid, Save the Children, the British Red Cross and Plan International UK have all launched appeals and are providing assistance.

"Jay Z launched a stream of tweets defending his premium music streaming app Tidal after the service, launched last month, was described as a flop. His social media diatribe comes as reports claim that Tidal is being sabotaged by rivals as it attempts to take business away from more-established music outlets such as Spotify and Apple. 'We may not be perfect - but we are determined,' he said while claiming that there are 'many big companies that are spending millions on a smear campaign'. 'We are here for the long haul,' the rapper and businessman tweeted in a string of 'stream of consciousness' messages. Scroll down for video . Twitter rant: Jay Z unleashed a string of 'stream of consciousness' tweets on Sunday defending his premium music streaming service Tidal and saying that it is still early days for the app . Tidal tweets: Using the hashtag #TidalFacts, the rap mogul told naysayers that 'actions will speak louder than words' as he continues to fine tune the streaming service he purchased for $56 million in January . Equality for all: The rapper and businessman insisted that Tidal is good for all artists and not just a money-maker for the big name artists like Kanye, Rihanna and Madonna who have joined him as co-founders . Feeling the need to vent: Jay Z decided to take to social media on Sunday in an aggressive push after what he saw as a 'smear campaign' from big companies against Tidal . Jay Z, who paid $56 million for TIDAL's technology in January and relaunched it in March, went on the offensive against the supposed smear campaign. Tidal has potential rivals including popular streaming service Spotify and tech giant Apple, though Jay Z did not post any details about the alleged campaign. After Tidal was criticized because of the wealth of its founders, the rapper said that other big tech companies also have huge amounts of money. 'Rich getting richer? Equity values... YouTube $390 billion. Apple $760 billion. Spotify $8 billion. Tidal $60 million,' he said. On Sunday Page Six claimed that there's also a 'war' looming between Tidal and Apple. Citing industry sources, the New York Post's gossip site alleged that tech giant Apple is trying to impede Tidal ahead of the scheduled relaunch in June of its own Beats Music by taking a long time to approve iOS updates for the Tidal app. 'Tidal had a new app on Android on April 15, but still hasn’t received approval for Apple’s iOS app store,' a source said. The site claimed that after Rihanna's song American Oxygen debuted on Tidal, there were technical problems with her music on iTunes. Apple told Page Six that the allegations that Rihanna's songs were deliberately scrambled are not true. The spokesperson declined to comment on the other claims made in the article, according to Page Six. War looming: A report from Page Six on Sunday said that Apple, which is launching its own music service, is trying to stop any growth by Tidal by delaying availability of updates for its app . Big guns: Tidal charges users $19.99 a month for its premium music streaming service and aims to take on rivals such as Spotify, Pandora and Apple's iTunes. Madonna and Rihanna are among the company's backers . In the same article, Page Six also alleged that Robert Kondrk, vice president of iTunes Content, has said any artists who put out exclusive music on Tidal won't be featured artists on iTunes. The article also reported that Sony Music will not grant Tidal a license to stream from Sony artists, one of whom is, of course, Jay Z's wife Beyonce. A representative for Sony Music declined to comment to Page Six. A month ago, some of the biggest names in music joined Jay Z for the launch of Tidal but the $19.99 a month subscription service is floundering in the app downloads charts. According to Billboard.com on Sunday, Tidal, which launched on March 30, has fallen out of Apple's top 750 apps, after a peak at No. 83 on April 7. The rapper's Twitter rant and news of tensions with other tech companies come after a week of bad press for TIDAL. The company's CEO Andy Chen also recently left the company amid a 'streamlining' of staff. Even those close to Jay-Z were seen as moving away from the potential failure. Co-founder Kanye West changed his Twitter avatar away from a logo for the service and deleted all mention of it from his account earlier this week. He later reaffirmed his support for the service in a tweet saying 'The love of music is louder than words'. Despite reports of its stuttering start, Jay-Z insisted on Twitter that Tidal is doing just fine. 'We have over 770,000 subs. We have been in business less than one month,' he tweeted, and included the hashtag #TidalFacts. Tweet of support: Canadian producer and performer Deadmaus5, who joined Jay Z on stage at the New York relaunch of Tidal on March 31, used his Twitter account Sunday to support the company . Tidal is co-owned by Jay Z, Kanye West, Beyonce, Madonna, Rihanna, Jack White, Alicia Keys and others. In his Sunday stream of tweets, Jay Z stressed that the service pays a 75 percent royalty rate to all artists and not just the high profile founders who appeared on stage at the launch. Other info he shared under the hashtag #TidalFacts included that 'iTunes Store wasn't built in a day' and 'It took Spotify 9 years to be successful.' TIDAL has attempted to differentiate away from its competitors by billing itself as having higher quality audio and being focused on rewarding those making music. Jay-Z referenced Tidal X which 'supports artists by giving them a platform to connect with their most loyal fans. Tidal is for all.' Canadian producer and performer Deadmaus5, who joined Jay Z on stage for the Tidal  launch in New York, jumped on the bandwagon Sunday. He tweeting his followers:  'despite whatever dumbs**t preconceptions you may or may not have about tidal, im still behind it. Im in it for industry growth, not PR. (sic).' Several artists have publicly criticized the roll-out, saying that Jay Z made it seem as if some of the world's biggest musicians wanted more money. 'When they say it's artist-owned, it's owned by those rich, wealthy artists,' Marcus Mumford, the frontman of Mumford & Sons, said in a recent and widely-disseminated interview with The Daily Beast website. Friction: Page Six claimed Sunday that Sony Music won't give Tidal a license to stream music by artists signed to it labels, which include Jay Z's wife Beyonce .

"Sergeant Edwin Mee, 46, has been accused of raping and molesting 11 young women who wanted to join the forces . A war veteran who swapped the battlefield for a 'dull' job as an army recruiter 'raped young hopefuls because it made the job more exciting', a court heard today. Sergeant Edwin Mee, 46, is said to have abused his position of power while interviewing applicants by raping and molesting 11 young women who wanted to join the forces. The officer - known as 'Jock' - allegedly carried out the attacks on women aged from 15 to their early twenties between October 2010 and September 2011 at an Army careers centre in Croydon. The alleged victims, who were desperate for jobs, were often new to the country and unaware of their rights, Southwark Crown Court heard. Mee, who has served in war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three counts of rape and one count of assault by penetration relating to 11 young cadets. Jurors were told earlier in the trial that one of the women, a virgin in her early 20s, fell pregnant after Mee raped her in a locked waiting room. An 18-year-old from Sierra Leone also claimed Mee raped her after saying he could help her get a visa. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC suggested 'risk taker' Mee who has fought in war zones across the world found interviewing recruits in Croydon 'dull'. 'But if he could use his position and manipulate it to take small risks at first and then bigger ones, it would make the job that much more exciting,' she said. 'Bullying, talking dirty to the young women, smacking bottoms and ultimately raping young women - he got away with it for a year or more. 'He obviously believed he would never get caught.' She said Mee believed he was the only 'real soldier' at the Mitcham Barracks Army Careers and Information Office in Croydon, south London. 'This case starts and finishes with Sergeant Jock, are you sure that he behaved the way the prosecution said or not - he is right at the centre of it all,' she said. He was British Army recruiting sergeant at Mitcham Barracks in Croydon (pictured) in the Careers and Information Office . 'He, of course, says he didn't do any of the violating, bullying and humiliating acts alleged against him. 'But there appears to be no good reason, or any reason, why any one of these women would lie - let alone 11 of them. 'What have you made of the evidence he gave and of the man whom you are going to be sitting in judgement? 'He is a man who is proud of his record in active service.' Jurors were told Mee thought little of his fellow recruiters, even if they were senior to him. 'He was the real soldier, he was the one who believed that he had the right to recruit those who would join the British Army,' said Ms Cottage. 'You may feel that was his attitude. With his promotion towards the end of 2010 did he come to believe in his own importance? 'Was he arrogant enough to believe that when he behaved in the way he did again and again with woman after woman that he had become so important within that office that they would not complain and even if they did, nobody else would believe them?' Mee, originally from Glasgow, joined the army when he was 24 and went on to serve tours of duty in Iraq - where he was attached to the Special Forces. By the time the allegations against him came to light he had acquired the rank of sergeant, and he was suspended in 2011. The court was told that Mee was medically discharged from the Army in April 2014. The alleged offences were initially investigated by the Royal Military Police, before the case was then handed to the Metropolitan Police. The trial continues.

"The stars of Martin Scorsese's classic 1990 gangster film Goodfellas reunited in New York on Saturday night for a very special 25th anniversary screening of the movie which brought the 14th annual Tribeca Film Festival to a close. Stars Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino were all in attendance although director Scorsese was filming in Taiwan and Joe Pesci, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1991 for his turn as Tommy DeVito, didn't show. 'Joe Pesci couldn't be here, but he sent this email: 'F***, f***, f***, f***ity f***, f***' read De Niro, introducing the screening at the Beacon Theatre. 'I'll translate: ""Dear Bob, sorry I can't be there. Love to all. Best, Joe.'"" Scroll down for video . The stars of Martin Scorsese's classic gangster film Goodfellas, Debi Mazar, Paul Sorvino, Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Lorraine Branco (from left to right) reunited in New York on Saturday night for a very special 25th anniversary screening of the movie which brought the 14th annual Tribeca Film Festival to a close . Released in 1990, Goodfellas charts the rise and fall of Lucchese crime family associate Henry Hill, played by Liotta, and his friends over a period from 1955 to 1980 . Scorsese and producer Irwin Winkler sent video messages to the audience. 'I remember the previews were one of the worst experiences of my life — we had three of them and they were all in California. ... It seemed that the audience had to be prepared for what it was, but there was a lot of controversy,' said the director. He went on to recall how he and screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi were no longer welcome at their favorite Italian restaurant after the movie - and its depiction of Italian-American mobsters - upset the owners. 'Remember that nice Italian restaurant in Tribeca that we used to go to? And then when the film came out, the owner of the restaurant said we're not allowed in anymore because we apparently denigrated a certain ethnic group for the picture?' said Scorsese. Throughout the two-and-a-half-hour screening the audience cheered each major character's first appearance along with iconic scenes like Karen Hill's doorbell-yelling session, and memorable lines like Henry Hill's opening narration: 'For as long as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.' Afterwards, Liotta, Bracco, De Niro, Sorvino and Pileggi recalled making the beloved film in a panel discussion moderated by Daily Show host Jon Stewart. Actress Lorriane Bracco appeared in Goodfellas as Henry Hill's wife Karen before going on to star as Dr. Jennifer Melfi in The Sopranos . Paul Sorvino, right, who starred as mob boss Paul 'Paulie' Cicero in the movie, revealed during the Q&A that he had come close to quitting just days before filming as he failed to find the character . In the absense of Pesci, it was left to Liotta, who played mob informant Henry Hill, to recall how his co-star's famous 'Do I Amuse You' sequence was almost entirely improvised. 'Joe was just telling a story in rehearsal about something that happened to him in Queens,' said Liotta. 'Some guy, who happened to be a connected guy, said, ""You think that's funny?"" The scene helped snag Pesci his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Liotta also recalled a bowling alley meeting with Hill, who told the actor he loved the movie. 'The first thing he said was thanks for not making me look like a s***bag,' said Liotta. 'I said, ""Did you see the movie?"" Sorvino, who starred as mob boss Paul 'Paulie' Cicero, then revealed that he had come close to quitting just days before filming. 'I was really lost, what do you do, I called my agent up and said, ""Get me out!,"" said the actor, who told the audiance that he is a 'soft guy' and nothing like his character. No show: Joe Pesci, who won an Oscar for his turn as Tommy DeVito, didn't show for the 25th year anniversary but sent an email which read 'F***, f***, f***, f***ity f***, f***', said De Niro . Twenty five years on: Ray Liotta and Lorriane Bracco starred as husband and wife Henry and Karen Hill in Martin Scorsese's gangster epic Goodfellas, left, and shared a drink at Saturday's reunion, right . Robert De Niro, who founded the Tribeca Film Festival, arrived at Saturday's screening with his wife Grace Hightower . 'Then I was going to fix my tie and I saw this guy (in the mirror),' he added, flashing a cold stare. 'And it scared the hell out of me. That's the guy!' Also in attendance were several actors who had minor roles in the movie including Kevin Corrigan and Debi Mazar, who played Sandy, a friend of Henry Hill's mistress. Earlier on the red carpet, Liotta had recalled something Scorsese told him before filming began that made him believe he was going to be part of something special. 'He said, 'I want to shoot this like a gangster,'' said Liotta. '''If I want to freeze frame, if I want to voice over, if I want to whatever ..."" And that's what he did. It gave him a lot liberty to just be him.' That mindset paid off. Many regard the Oscar-nominated mob tale as more than just a great film of the genre, but also one of the greatest movies of all time. Scorsese used a compelling narrative with strong visuals married by a powerful rock soundtrack to reinvent the gangster film. 'I don't know if he reinvented it as much as he just created his own version of it,' Liotta said. Sorvino, who portrayed Paulie the mob capo that takes Liotta's Henry under his wing, thinks Scorsese went beyond reinventing the genre. 'It's not even part of a genre; it's like tearing off that wall and taking a look inside to see what it really is,' Sorvino said of the gritty depiction of life as a mid-level mobster. Jon Stewart, far right, hosted a Q&A with the film's star during which Ray Liotta, far left, recalled meeting the real Henry Hill, who thanked him for 'not making me look like a s***bag' In attendance at Saturday's screening of Goodfellas were actors Paul Sorvino, Debi Mazar, Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco and Kevin Corrigan (from left to right) The 76-year-old actor expressed gratitude to have a part in the film. 'It's part of the iconography of American film,' Sorvino said. 'It's one of the three or four greatest movies ever made, and if you get to do that in your career, you're pretty lucky.' Based on the nonfiction best-seller Wiseguy written by Nicholas Pileggi, the story traces the life of Henry Hill — a mobster-turned-informant — from his childhood and life of petty crime to rise and fall in the underworld. The film also stars De Niro as James 'Jimmy The Gent' Conway. De Niro is one of the film festival's co-creators. 'The fact that he helped put it together right after 9/11 and bring Tribeca back as well as New York — that was just honorable in itself. And to sustain it for so long now, it represents a great thing in movies, that's great for movies, and a great thing for the city,' Liotta said. De Niro, Jane Rosenthal and Craig Hatkoff founded the Tribeca Film Festival in 2002 as a means of stimulating the lower Manhattan neighborhood after the Sepember 11 attacks. But Lorraine Bracco, who played Henry's wife, Karen, thinks the festival did more than revitalize the city. 'It's for the world to see that we're still standing strong,' Bracco said.

"Celebrities and dietitians have been promoting back-to-basic diets and warning us off processed foods for years - and the trend is now taking hold in the pet world. Three-and-a-half-year-old black labrador Baylie swapped sweet treats and processed dog food for a diet of free range raw meat, offal and bones in his quest to lose weight. His owners, Margaret and Patrick Evans from Leeds, say he's now 'a different dog' after losing a stone and a half in eight weeks through the doggy diet - the weight of four chihuahuas. Scroll down for video . Flab to fab: Baylie learnt where the doggy biscuit tin was and was even caught pilfering it, left, by his owners. But he's a much more lean machine, right, after starting his new weight loss programme . The plan was devised by Vicky Marshall, who runs a natural dog food company and realised that none of her 5,000 customers' dogs have weight problems. She worked out Baylie's weight and calculated special portions of carefully chosen lean meats in order for him to shed the pounds. She said: 'Dogs are carnivores - they have evolved to eat prey, such as mice, rabbits and deer. 'Their digestive system, which is very different to the human digestive system, is more than able to handle raw meat, offal and bones. Loving life: Owners Margaret and Patrick Evans say Baylie is 'a different dog' since losing a stone and a half on a new doggy diet of raw food. They believe his weight problems stem from rewards during training . 'In fact, they thrive on it and you need have no concerns over its suitability. 'We avoided beef and lamb and suggested lean raw meat like free range chicken, wild rabbit and turkey. 'Our treats are pure air-dried liver and dogs don't need very much to feel like they've had a treat. 'We also introduced a concept called Bone Sunday. We gave Baylie a beef knuckle bone to chew on all day and he didn't need anything else to eat. 'Because the bone marrow is so rich it's enough quantity wise. And the action of chewing is great exercise and a rewarding game. 'It makes sure he doesn't feel like he is on a diet and that food is still fun.' Baylie's owners believe his life-long weight problem stemmed from them giving him sweet treats to reward good behaviour at puppy training school. The treats continued into his adult life and he even learnt where they were kept and was spotted raiding the biscuit tin in the kitchen. His weight problem worsened as he started suffering from a joint problem called hip dysplasia affecting Labradors - and when he took a tumble while out on a walk he was left unable to move. Maragaret, 55, a car tyre production assistant said: 'We were encouraged to use biscuits as rewards but he was so good at everything we taught him we just had to carry on giving him treats. 'His weight just went on and on and on. 'But it got a lot worse when he slipped over one day when we were out for a walk in the woods. 'He injured his leg and couldn't walk very far so it made it really difficult to take him out for exercise. 'And because he has hip dysplasia it meant his recovery took a long time. 'He became sluggish and tired all the time and he just carried on piling on the pounds. 'I think it didn't help that he knew his way round the kitchen and exactly where we kept the dog biscuits. 'I knew his weight was becoming a problem but it wasn't until we got to the vet that we realised how big he had got. 'Once I took him to the vet and we realised how bad the problem with his weight was we knew we had to take action straight away.' Standing tall: Baylie struggled with a hip condition common in labradors and poor mobility worsened his weight problems. But losing weight has made him much more mobile . After spotting an advert for the trial of a new diet for dogs on facebook, Margaret signed Baylie up for the new regime - The Lucky Dog Weight Loss Plan. It meant - just like a human trying to fight the flab - swapping his usual processed food and sweet treats for low fat meats. After eight weeks he had lost eight kilos, going from 55kg - the weight of a small great dane - to 47. A much slimmer Baylie comes back to the beach after a swim in the sea during a walk on the beach . Shake it off: Baylie is able to enjoy a dog's life after shedding so much weight with his doggy diet of lean meat . Margaret added: 'We changed his diet straight away and went from tins and packets to all raw food. 'And because all of the food was delivered and it was a complete change it was really straightforward. 'Now he runs around and has bounds more energy. 'He loves a ball and is absolutely mad about going for a swim. We can't even run a bath without him trying to jump into the bathroom. 'He's like a completely different dog.' A different dog: 'Now he runs around and has bounds more energy', said owner Margaret who took him to the vets as soon as she realised how serious his weight problem was .","Labrador Baylie from Leeds suffers from hip problems - and a sweet tooth .

"A taxi driver has been ordered to pay compensation to a passenger who was left with severe brain injuries after he jumped out of the moving car. Kristopher Hicks, now 27, was on his way home from a night out in Bath, Somerset, with his girlfriend in a taxi driven by Michael Young, 56, five years ago. Mr Young, a former soldier, had mistakenly believed Mr Hicks was planning to 'do a runner' and decided to drive him back to the rank in a bid to teach him a lesson. But when Mr Hicks objected, the driver continued on for almost a mile, leading him to jump from the vehicle while it was travelling at more than 20mph. He suffered devastating brain injuries, developed epilepsy and now requires round-the-clock care from his mother. Mr Hicks' family, from Bath, took driver Mr Young to the High Court (pictured), where a judge ruled he had unlawfully imprisoned his passenger . Mr Hicks' family, from Bath, took Mr Young to the High Court. There, Mr Justice Edis ruled the driver had unlawfully imprisoned Mr Hicks, who was therefore entitled to damages. The exact amount of compensation is yet to be decided - but is set to be around 50 per cent of what the family had requested and thought to be 'hundreds of thousands of pounds'. Speaking on behalf of the family, lawyer James Davies said: 'This was a terrible incident in which Kristopher suffered a very severe brain injury leaving him needing care for the rest of his life. 'The latest judgement agrees that Kristopher is entitled to a settlement to provide specialist rehabilitation and care which will help maximise his progress.' Mr Hicks, who was 23 at the time of the incident, had gotten into the taxi with his girlfriend Abigail Noad at Orange Grove taxi rank in Bath to his home in the Foxhill area, according to high court documents. In a police interview, Mr Young said he had become suspicious after hearing Ms Noad joke that the couple were not going to 'do a runner'. Deciding the issue of liability, the judge said Mr Young mistakenly decided Mr Hicks was not going to pay the fare on November 2 in 2010, adding there was no basis for him to think so. The driver had decided to take Mr Hicks back to the rank to cause him as much inconvenience as possible. Mr Hicks, who found himself being unlawfully driven off by a stranger into the night, decided he should try to escape. Mr Justice Edis said: 'The end result is that the claimant decided to jump out of the taxi at a dangerous speed. I do not know why he did this. 'It may have been that he misjudged the speed and thought it was safe to do so, but the true motive will never be known.' He said had Mr Hicks jumped out when it was stationary at lights there would be no permanent damage.

'I have broadly accepted the evidence of the defendant and therefore find that his intention was not to do anything other than to return him to the rank where he would be released,' he added. 'This is the kind of conduct which creates a significant risk to life and limb as this case demonstrates.' The judge said it was a 'stark and unattractive choice' to decide between the two - and concluded there should be a 50 per cent reduction in the damages payable to Mr Hicks. He was also entitled to a further £250 for unlawful imprisonment. Lawyers representing Mr Hicks said the incident left him with 'devastating' brain injuries and he is now being cared for by his mother Gill. Speaking at the time the claim was lodged with the High Court, James Davies, said: 'Whilst he has undergone extensive treatment and rehabilitation, he has developed post-traumatic epilepsy, headaches, fatigue, suffers social and behavioural problems and has no sense of taste or smell. 'He is reliant on 24-hour care from his mum and is unable to work.' Both sides were given permission to appeal and a further hearing will determine the amount which Mr Young will have to pay.","Driver Michael Young, 56, thought passenger was planning to 'do a runner'

"A 4,000-year-old tree thought to be Britain's oldest living organism may be dying according to its custodian. The stunning Ashbrittle Yew, in the churchyard of the parish's Church of St John the Baptist, in Somerset, has a girth of 38ft and an enormous vast canopy. Its central trunk is hollow with six smaller ones branching off - possible due to disease - and locals fear it is on its way out due to wilting branches and falling leaves. The 4,000-year-old tree is 'looking extremely sick,' according to a warden at the church in Ashbrittle, Somerset . Churchwarden Charles Doble said: 'The tree is supposed to be the oldest living thing in England and was already fairly mature when Stonehenge was being built. 'Experts say it is 3,500 to 4,000 years old. 'But it's looking extremely sick at the moment and I'm worried whether the rural church or the yew will die first.' But tree expert Dr Owen Johnson said the yew, in the village 10 miles west of Taunton, could just be going through a bad patch. He said: 'They go through spells where they might look as though they are not thriving, but a few years later they might look fine.' The Ashbrittle Yew is the subject of myth and legend and people believe the mound it grows on is Bronze Age and that a pre-Roman chief is buried there. The world's oldest tree lives on a mountain in central Sweden – and it is still growing. The 9,500-year-old Norwegian Spruce (pictured right) was discovered by scientists at Umeå University during a 2004 tree census in Fulufjällets National Park in Sweden. The age of the tree was established using carbon-14 dating at a laboratory in Miami, Florida after an investigation by the university. It has been able to survive so long thanks to the process of vegetative propagation, which means it is able to effectively clone itself. While the visible portion of the 13ft tall tree is relatively new, its root system has been growing for almost ten thousand years.","Experts say the Ashbrittle Yew was mature when Stonehenge was built .

"As a sequel of sorts to the Diane Sawyer 20/20 special, TV viewers will be able to follow Bruce Jenner's journey as he transitions into a woman in his forthcoming eight-episode docu-series on E! starting July 27. But it is allegedly his sons Burt, Brandon and Brody Jenner and stepdaughter Kim Kardashian who are hesitant to hear and watch just how much their 65-year-old patriarch will reveal about gender change. 'They are warning him to slow down on revealing too much of his journey on reality TV,' a source told TMZ in a Monday report. Scroll down for video . Follow-up: Bruce Jenner will chronicle his journey as he transitions into a woman in his forthcoming eight-episode docu-series on E!, a project that worries his kids according to TMZ on Monday . There is no denying that Bruce's six biological children and four stepkids are 'proud' of the father figure as some called him their 'hero' on Twitter shortly after the ABC interview aired on Friday. And as the former Olympic gold medalist moves forward with his long-awaited physical transformation, the spotlight and attention on him will be brighter than ever. 'Kim and the boys think Bruce was spectacular on the Diane Sawyer special and in won over millions of people in the process. His kids have gone to their dad to express their concern,' the insider told the gossip site. 'They say they're worried Bruce's upcoming docu-series might ""de-class"" what he's accomplished. They also urged Bruce not to do other interviews, and finish the process in private.' The only Kardashian: 'Kim and the boys think Bruce was spectacular on the Diane Sawyer special and in won over millions of people in the process,' added a source . Jenner sons: 'They are warning him to slow down on revealing too much of his journey on reality TV,' it was also shared . Brandon and his brothers: 'They urged Bruce not to do other interviews, and finish the process in private,' it was noted . Adding: 'Bruce believes the docu-series will educate people and create empathy, so he's committed.' On Monday, never-before-seen footage from the tell-all interview aired on Good Morning America that showed the Jenner brothers and Bruce's eldest daughter Casey talking about their childhoods in which Bruce was not around for. 'We have a very complex relationship,' Casey admitted. 'He's disappeared out of our lives, especially out of my life, so I'm looking forward to this next chapter.' Brandon spoke of Bruce during the years in the early '80s: 'Us missing a time of our lives is still the probably the hardest thing for us to deal with, we're trying not to look back, just looking forward.' Sticking together: Brandon and Brody share the same mother (second wife Linda Thompson) while eldest child Burt is from first marriage to Chrystie Jenner (pictured in May 2012) Older kids: Burt, Brody, daughter Casey and Brandon were the only children who appeared in the 20/20 interview . Struggle: '[Bruce] disappeared out of our lives, especially out of my life, so I'm looking forward to this next chapter' Bruce admitted he was not around for his children when they need him the most telling Diane: 'The big formative years for them I was really struggling with these issues. I talked to all the boys about this after the fact that, yeah, I didn't do a good job. And I apologized to my kids for that.' Those times appear to be a thing of the past as the Jenner siblings have now stated that 'all is forgiven.' While the Keeping Up With The Kardashians cast did not appear on the 20/20 interview - viewed by a staggering 16.9 million people - many speculate that ex-wife Kris Jenner and her children Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, Rob and Kylie and Kendall will be featured on the upcoming docu-series because it will be broadcasted on the E! network. However, TMZ's sources cited that 'Bruce's kids won't appear on his show.' Love no matter what: During the interview, Bruce stated that Kim was 'by far the most accepting' of his transgender journey . Growing up without their father: 'Us missing a time of our lives is still the probably the hardest thing for us to deal with, we're trying not to look back, just looking forward' With the hope that his reality show will be both informational and educational, Bruce has signed a contract with E! to air one hour episodes starting July 27 that will be consulted by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) organization. Jeff Olde, Executive Vice President of Programming and Development at E!, said of Bruce's decision to share his journey with the world: 'Bruce is incredibly courageous and an inspiration, and we are proud to be entrusted with this deeply personal and important story. 'This series will present an unfiltered look as Bruce boldly steps into uncharted territory and is true to himself for the first time.' Bruce's representative told MailOnline: 'Can't put a series on hold that has yet to be confirmed as even happening in the first place.' Champion: 'Bruce believes the docu-series will educate people and create empathy, so he's committed' His pride and joy: The former Olympic athlete told Diane that his kids are 'the only one's he's concerned with' On Sunday, eldest child Burt doubted some of his dad's newfound supporters when he took to Twitter writing: 'Having a hard time not putting a few people on blast who were not supporters before hand, but want to act like they were all along.' Meanwhile that same day Brandon and Brody - whom Bruce fathered with second wife Linda Thompson - shared photos of themselves with their famous parent. 'You won another gold tonight. I stand with you on this journey. I love you Dad,' the former Hills star commented on Saturday. 'Proud son,' the father-to-be - who was the first to be told by Bruce about the transition - wrote before the ABC interview aired on Friday. Kim spoke to Today Show's Matt Lauer on Monday revealing that Bruce has 'found inner peace' after speaking his truth. The other side of Bruce's family: Biological daughters Kendall and Kylie and stepdaughters Kourtney and Khloe were pictured on Thursday with mother Kris Jenner . Spotlight: E!'s Keeping Up With The Kardashians has been featured as a hit reality show for ten seasons now . During the 20/20 special, the thrice married star and host Diane shared that it would be the last interview would doing as Bruce and that he is ready to embrace the woman he calls 'Her.' The star expressed that he 'is a girl stuck in a guy's body' and that 'his brain is much more female than it is male. 'Yes I am a woman, my heart and my soul and everything I do in life,' he said. 'That female side is who I am.' When asked by Diane to fill in the blank 'When you think of me...' Bruce gave a heartfelt response saying: 'Please be open minded, have an open mind and open heart. I'm not this bad person I'm just doing what I've got to do.' 'If he's happy, we're happy': Kendall and Kylie were the only offspring to give an official statement for the ABC special .","Bruce is set to star in an eight-episode docu-series on E! starting July 27 .

"An isolated edge of vast West Texas is home to a highly secretive part of the 21st-century space race, one of two being directed in the Lone Star State by Internet billionaires whose personalities and corporate strategies seem worlds apart. The presence of Blue Origin, LLC, the brainchild of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, barely registers in nearby Van Horn, a way station along Interstate 10, a full decade after he began buying land in one of Texas' largest and most remote counties. Few visitors are allowed beyond the 'No Trespassing' sign and a remote-controlled gate and into the desert and mountain environment reminiscent of the Air Force's renowned Area 51 in Nevada. The privileged who do get inside decline to describe what they've seen, typically citing confidentiality agreements. Billionaires: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (left) and SpaceX Elon Musk (right) have seemingly unlimited resources — Bezos' wealth is estimated at nearly $35 billion, Musk's at $12 billion . Mysterious: The presence of Blue Origin, LLC, the brainchild of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, barely registers in Van Horn, Texas, a way station along Interstate 10 . Facility: A SpaceX rocket is seen in Cape Canaveral, Florida, in this February 2015 file image. SpaceX is frequently in the headlines thanks to its nearly $2 billion federal contract, and its attempts to reuse booster rockets have been rocky . 'No one gets in other than employees,' says Robert Morales, editor of the weekly Van Horn Advocate newspaper. At the opposite end — of Texas and the competition — is the highly visible SpaceX venture, led by PayPal co-founder and electric car maker Elon Musk. His company contracts with NASA to resupply the International Space Station and is building a launch site about 600 miles from Van Horn, on the southernmost Texas Gulf coast, with the much-publicized goal of sending humans to Mars. SpaceX and Blue Origin are among several U.S. companies engaged in the private space business. Both men have seemingly unlimited resources — Bezos' wealth is estimated at nearly $35 billion, Musk's at $12 billion — and lofty aspirations: launching a new era of commercial space operations, in part by cutting costs through reusable rockets. Texas' glory days of space exploration, when 'Right Stuff' Mercury astronauts trained in Houston and the city's name was the first word spoken on the moon by Neil Armstrong, are long gone. The utilitarian Space Shuttle fell to budget cuts, depletion and age, leaving astronauts to hitch rides on Russian rockets. Any success by the newcomers would offer 'significant potential for re-invigorating space research and development in the state,' said John Junkins, director of the Center for Mechanics and Control at Texas A&M's Department of Aerospace Engineering. Earlier this month, Bezos announced his company's new hydrogen rocket engine, designed for suborbital missions, had completed hundreds of tests at the West Texas site, adding, 'soon we'll put it to the ultimate test of flight.' That could come late this year. A more powerful engine for orbital flights, fueled by liquid oxygen and liquid natural gas, is being developed with United Launch Alliance, a venture of aerospace veterans Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. Blue Origin officials declined requests for an interview and site visit. 'I'm so sorry,' spokeswoman Brooke Crawford said. 'It's just the way it is.' Secretive: The privileged who do get inside Blue Origin decline to describe what they've seen, typically citing confidentiality agreements . Quiet: Blue Origin's presence in Van Horn, Texas, is minimal . In a Sept. 22, 2014 file photo, U.S. Rep. Filemon Vela, left, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk, center, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry turn the first shovel-full of sand at the groundbreaking ceremony for the SpaceX launch pad at Boca Chica Beach, Texas . Company: A SpaceX rocket is seen here at Cape Canaveral, Florida, in April 2015 . Bezos' love of space originated in Texas in the 1960s when his family moved to Houston, which dubbed itself 'Space City USA.' 'For me, space is something that I have been in love with since I was 5 years old,' Bezos, 51, said in a September interview with The Washington Post, which he purchased in 2013. 'I watched Neil Armstrong step onto the surface of the moon, and I guess it imprinted me.' Over the last decade, he has bought at least seven ranches, totaling 1,900 square miles, near the Texas-New Mexico border and Guadalupe Mountains National Park. 'It's very secretive out there,' said Maricel Gonzalez, chief appraiser for the Culberson County Appraisal District. She declined to describe it, citing a nondisclosure agreement. A UPS driver who recently emerged from the compound also declined to talk. Nuny Morriss, a Van Horn city council member and FedEx delivery driver, said the site includes a 'big warehouse-looking building and some offices ... But they don't let us go around in the back.' Blue Origin's presence in Van Horn is minimal. Morriss recalled word getting out a few years ago about a scheduled launch. Traffic at the local airstrip suggested that VIPs were coming in, and local officials were eager to join them. 'No one in town got invited,' Morriss said. By contrast, SpaceX is frequently in the headlines thanks to its nearly $2 billion federal contract. Attempts to reuse booster rockets have been rocky; it's failed three times to land them on a platform off the Florida coast. SpaceX already has a rocket plant near Waco. With more than $15 million in state incentives, it's also building a launch site at Boca Chica Beach, near Brownsville. Musk hopes for at least 12 rocket launches a year, starting late next year. 'The long-term goal is to create technology necessary to take humanity beyond Earth,' said the 43-year-old South Africa native. David Kanipe, a former NASA division chief now teaching at Texas A&M, says Musk and Bezos were cool to his offers of assistance. 'A lot of time these companies, maybe for good reason, they don't really want to use or benefit from the lessons learned from what NASA did for 40 years, 50 years,' Kanipe said. 'I pleaded with them: ""Let us help, use our experience."" But they have other ideas.' All of the private space businesses have had setbacks, such as Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, which lost a spacecraft and a pilot in October over California's Mojave Desert. 'There's just a million ways it can go wrong,' Kanipe said. 'I think it's doable, but it's just going to take a while.'","Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin are among several US companies engaged in the private space business .

"Nick Clegg tonight set out the first of his 'red lines' for a second coalition, warning he will block any cut in education spending. The Liberal Democrats admitted today that their best hope is to end up with 30-something MPs after May 7, compared with the 57 elected in 2010. A senior party source said their best chance of holding the balance of power after the General Election was to finish 'in the 30s' if they are able to retain a number of closely-fought seats. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, making play dough at Tops Day Nursery, Corfe Mullen in Dorset, said he would demand education spending be protected from cuts as the price of propping up another coalition . Mr Clegg said the first of what he dubbed his 'Premier League policies' is a £5billion commitment to protect the entire education budget in real terms. But Mr Clegg is still determined to form a coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour and today vowed to set out which of the policies announced in his manifesto would be non-negotiable. The first of what he dubbed his 'Premier League policies', which the party would insist upon as a condition of propping up a government, is a £5billion commitment to protect the entire education budget in real terms. It would mean raising spending on education every year from 2018 onwards and at all stages 'from cradle to college', which goes further than the Tories or Labour have promised. Mr Clegg said: 'I can confirm a Liberal Democrat red line – a pre-condition for Government – is increasing spending on education. 'The Liberal Democrats will not allow our children and grandchildren to pay the price of this generation's mistakes. We believe above all else in spreading opportunity, in tearing down the barriers that stop people from reaching their potential. Nothing is more crucial to that than education.' The Lib Dem leader - who claimed just last week that he would not set out 'red lines' - said people felt 'confused' about the outcome of the election and he wanted to be 'clear and certain' about his party's intentions. The pledge would mean raising spending on education every year from 2018 onwards and at all stages 'from cradle to college', which goes further than the Tories or Labour have promised . The Liberal Democrats admitted today that their best hope is to end up with 30-something MPs after May 7, compared with the 57 elected in 2010 . Inviting criticism that the rest of his policies are all negotiable, he said he would fight for everything in the manifesto but that 'here are some Premier League policies and others which don't assume quite the same significance'. 'I will confirm the non-negotiables, the deal breakers, the things without which we would not enter into a coalition government and I'll do so fairly rapidly over the next few days', he said. Mr Clegg's policy is £5billion more expensive that what the Conservatives had planned – which is a freeze on schools spending for those aged 5 to 16 and cuts in other areas. It is £2.5bn more than Labour planned to spend on protecting the entire education budget but not accounting for an expected 460,000 rise in pupil numbers over the next five years. 'The next Government must increase spending on nurseries, schools and colleges. That means education spending must rise with both prices and pupil numbers', he said. 'Without investment in education, there can be no deal with the Liberal Democrats.' The pledge would take education funding from £49bn a year currently to more than £55 by the end of the next Parliament, to be funded by rising economic growth once the deficit is cleared. A promise on education spending is intended to win over floating voters in key seats where the Lib Dems are facing the Tories, to capitalise on concerns about cuts to public services. A senior lib dem involved in party strategy said the campaign's focus was increasingly on 10 to 15 marginal seats. Mr Clegg would not comment on numbers of seats and simply said his party would do better than dire opinion polls suggest.","Clegg names the first of his 'Premier League policies' as price of support .

"Former primary school teacher Mary Cowan, 92, has generously stated in her will that £700,000 of her £2million fortune should be left to charity groups . A teacher who taught at Sir Chris Hoy's former school has left a share of the £2million fortune she made from stocks and shares to help children from poorer backgrounds. Mary Cowan, 92, generously ordered that a large slice of her estate should be given to George Watson's College in Edinburgh where she had devoted years of her life to teaching primary school children. Ms Cowan, of Edinburgh, passed away in November last year but her will revealed she asked for a bursary scheme to be set up in her name at the school where famous faces such as Olympic hero Sir Chris Hoy and rugby legend Gavin Hastings were taught. Ms Cowan never married and worked and lived in Edinburgh her whole adult life, retiring from her job at the college in 1981. She started off teaching pupils of primary school age, before working her way up to be assistant headmistress. She was raised with her brother Martin in Kirkcudbrightshire, where her family had lived for generations and ran a grocer shop, before moving to the city where she lived in a modest semi-detached house which sold for £490,000 in 2012. Her published will has now revealed that she had an estate worth nearly £2million and asked that more than £700,000 be given to friends and family. The bulk of her wealth was made up of a stocks and shares portfolio and she left instructions for the remainder to be handed over to good causes. The Mary Cowan Bursary will have funds of around £325,000 and will be used to help current or prospective poorer pupils attend the school. A group of trustees will decide if applicants are successful. Ms Cowan also asked that Falkirk High School be given a share of her estate to set up a fund in memory of her mother called the 'The Jane Martin Waddell Prize' that would see outstanding pupils recognised for academic achievements. Other groups which can expect windfalls include The Royal National Institute of Blind People, Blind Veterans UK, Christian Aid, and The Salvation Army. Morningside Parish Church in Edinburgh, where Ms Cowan was a well-known member of the congregation, Alzheimer Scotland, and The Royal Hospital for Sick Children have also been included in her will. Ms Cowan stated in her will that a bursary scheme should be set up in her name at George Watson's College in Edinburgh, where she taught. She left around £325,000 to the fund to help poorer pupils attend the school . Ms Cowan, of Edinburgh, asked in her will for a bursary scheme to be set up in her name at George Watson's College where famous faces such as Sir Chris Hoy (left) and rugby legend Gavin Hastings (right) were taught . Reverend Derek Browning of Morningside Parish Church paid tribute to the generous former teacher. He said: 'First and foremost she was a teacher - and her passion for Watson's was second to none. George Watson's College in Edinburgh . Falkirk High School . The Royal National Institute of Blind People . Blind Veterans UK . Christian Aid . The Salvation Army . Morningside Parish Church in Edinburgh . Alzheimer Scotland . The Royal Hospital for Sick Children . 'Ms Cowan was supremely proud of her school, and delighted to work alongside staff who shared her commitment to educating the young. 'I know that her influence and her enthusiasm have touched many lives, and she remembered her students with pleasure and affection.' He added: 'Church was her other great passion. She loved her church, and did everything she could to help those in it. 'She was the epitome of a Christian lady. 'She taught by example, she lived by faith, she enjoyed so many things, and was interested in just about everything.' Melvyn Roffe, principal of George Watson's College, said: 'Mary Cowan was well known in the Watson's community having taught many generations of pupils and we were very sad to hear of her recent death. 'Miss Cowan joined George Watson's Ladies College in George Square as a primary school teacher, also teaching French, in 1945 and taught until 1972 when she was appointed assistant head teacher in the primary school. Ms Cowan never married and had no children. She grew up in Kirkcudbrightshire before moving to Edinburgh where she lived for the rest of her life, including in this semi-detached property (right) for 20 years until 2012 . Ms Cowan also left money for Alzheimer Scotland and The Royal Hospital for Sick Children (pictured) 'She finally retired from Watson's in 1981. Throughout her life she was a great supporter of our Family Foundation.

"Jane Tipper had been walking her dog Molly when the eight-year-old chased a lamb over a cliff . A Border Terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall after chasing a spring lamb off the edge of  a cliff before spending three days stranded on a remote beach. Dog Molly had been on a walk with owner Jane Tipper and her daughter Hannah in Eype, Dorset, last week when the she fell over the cliff's edge along with the lamb. Molly survived a vertical drop of 100ft then rolled 150ft down a steep slope and coming to rest in gorse near the bottom. Her distraught owners managed to see that the eight-year-old had survived the drop, but had no way of getting down to the beach to get her. A team of ten coastguards arrived on the scene and a winchman was lowered down the cliff face but was unable to find her despite four hours of searching. Ms Tipper, who had been celebrating her 64th birthday, was forced to return home in nearby Charmouth without her beloved dog which she has had since she was a puppy. She contacted the website DogLost which arranged for missing posters to be put up in the area. Three days later, Molly was found in an exhaustive state after walking a mile further along the beach to an area popular with dog walkers. It is unclear what had happened, but luckily, she has come through her ordeal relatively unscathed - but there has been no sign of the lamb since the incident. Ms Tipper said: 'I was with my daughter, it was my birthday and we planned a short walk and lunch in a local cafe but we never got there. The border terrier miraculously survived a 250ft fall, including a 100ft vertical drop, in Eype, Dorset, but her owner had no way of reaching her. Coastguards searched thoroughly but were unable to find her . 'Molly's usually very good, she doesn't chase animals. 'She fell about 200ft but the cliff was on a slight slope. I couldn't see her at the bottom but my daughter did so we knew she survived the drop. 'The coastguard winched one of them over the cliff and he went from side to side looking for her but couldn't see her. 'It's rocky there, there's thick patches of gorse and it's extremely dangerous. 'After a couple of hours they said they just couldn't spot her. They were very upset about it.' She added the incident left her 'completely numb'. 'We didn't stop searching at the end of the day,' she said. 'When I got home I phoned as many people as I could think of.' But fortunately, a female dog walker recognised Molly from the lost posters that had been put up in the area on Friday. After Ms Tipper put up missing dog posters, Molly was identified by a dog walker three days after going missing. Pictured right, the cliff face in Dorset where Molly fell . Ms Tipper added: 'The lady was walking her dogs when Molly followed her and sat next to her. She called me and we met up and fortunately it was Molly, I was worried it was going to be someone else's dog. 'Molly was very pleased to see me, especially when I got a gravy bone out of my pocket. 'She wasn't hurt or limping or anything, but she was shattered and spent the rest of the day asleep when we got home. 'I think it's really knocked the stuffing out of her. ' A coastguard spokesman urged dog owners to always keep their pets on lead while walking near the coast.","Dog Molly had been on a walk with her owner Jane Tipper in Eype, Dorset .

"A deskbound worker has used a GoPro camera to capture a unique view of his boring office job, turning even the most mundane day-to-day tasks into a high octane activities. Daniel Williams, from Toronto, filmed himself doing everything from sealing envelopes and sending emails to making cups and coffee and going to the bathroom, before editing all of the clips together to offer an action-packed perspective of his regular daily life. The video, which is titled 'Boring Office Job GoPro Commercial', has clearly struck a chord with people working in similar jobs around the globe, with the video already attracting an impressive three million views since being uploaded to YouTube last week. Office space: Daniel Williams, an office worker from Toronto, captured his entire day with a GoPro camera . Bright idea: Mr Williams came up with the idea after seeing other breathtaking GoPro videos online . The 90-second video makes a change from the usual, dramatic content normally caught by such cameras which, thanks to their durability, are often used to film some of the most breathtaking moments in life from base jumps to shark encounters. This time, however, viewers are treated to Mr WIlliams removing staples, photocopying, stuffing envelopes, drinking coffee, and even going to the bathroom. All set to a techno beat, the pacey clip turns a regular 9-to-5 office job into something far more exhilarating. Button pusher: In the 90-second video, Mr Williams filmed himself stapling, photocopying (pictured) and stuffing envelopes . Downtime: There are also shots of Mr Williams drinking coffee and going to the toilet - all set to a techno beat soundtrack . Stuffed: 'I wore my GoPro to work one day and decided to edit the footage to the style of a GoPro Commercial,' Mr Williams wrote . Alongside the video, the Toronto filmmaker wrote in the description: 'I wore my GoPro to work one day and decided to edit the footage to the style of a GoPro commercial.' He said that he decided to take on office temp work in order to pay the bills between documentary projects. And it was whilst he was working for a real estate company for six months that he came up with the idea for the unique video. 'The job was a lot of very mundane repetitive tasks. For a creative guy like me it kind of killed me,' Mr Williams told the New York Daily News.. Doodling: In between films and documentaries Mr Williams takes on temporary office jobs. It was during one such clerical job that he came up with the idea . Ready for launch! Mr Williams says he thought it would be a funny idea to record everything he does during the day including playing with his pen . ‘[People always use GoPro cameras to film] these action videos, but the reality is the people who buy these cameras have everyday jobs,’ he added. The video has thus far earned a huge amount of praise from viewers on YouTube, many of whom have been quick to comment about how well Mr Williams has managed to capture the mundane repetition involved in a typical office job. 'So good. So accurate,' said YouTube user Ryan Bobbe. 'Sometimes I wish I had a job like this instead of dealing with a mass amount of idiotic people a day' wrote another.","Daniel Williams’ video shows a every aspect of a day in the life of an office worker .

"A Russian woman indundated with vicious and homophobic messages for running a support group for LGBT teenagers, has publicly shamed her trolls by posting their identities online. Elena Klimova, 26, who runs Children 404 - an online support group for  young people about coming out and dealing with discrimination - regularly receives obscene hate-filled rants from strangers telling her she's 'disgusting' and should kill herself. The activist fought back by publishing the messages on VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, under the title: 'Beautiful People And The Things They Say To Me'. Elena Klimova managed to track down the social media accounts of many of her trolls, and has posted their vile messages along with candid photos of each sender (pictured) to a Russian website called VKontakte . Comments include one from a man who told her: You f****** animal, delete your f****** LGBT group.' A woman named Yulia sent Elena a particularly vitriolic message. 'Hello, Lena. My f*g brother... is one of your friends online, so I have a request for you, teach him not to show his f***** tendencies when he comes to family gatherings. 'He will never be accepted by anyone in our family as a f**, so he can sit and shut up.' Elena posted this message along with a photo of Yulia grinning and posing with a bunch of wild flowers. While Elena has revealed the faces of the people her trolls, MailOnline has blurred them. Elena Klimova (pictured) is a Russian activist for the LGBT (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender) community who receives a vast volume of hate mail . 'You f*****g animal, delete your f*****g LGBT group,' one man wrote to Elena, which she rather poignantly posted with a photo of said man holding an outstretched cat (pictured) 'As beautiful people write to me often, this album will be continually updated,' Klimova wrote on her VKontakte page, according to Buzzfeed. 'It was created for the enjoyment of contrasts and the diversity of life.' The name of Elena's group, Children 404, is a reference to the 'page not found' online error notice and Russia’s law banning 'gay propaganda' among minors. One of the website's slogans is 'LGBT Teens: We Exist.' Another message, this time from a man named Dmitry, referred to homosexuals as 'libidinous f****** perverts'. In Dmitry's photo, he is seen with his arm affectionately around the shoulders of a female companion. This woman (pictured) wrote, 'Hello, Lena. My f*g brother... is one of your friends online. He will never be accepted by anyone in our family as a f*g, so he can sit and shut up' Elena dubbed the album, 'Beautiful People And The Things They Say To Me' Another message (pictured), this time from a man named Dmitry (right), referred to homosexuals as 'libidinous f****** perverts' Another troll wrote: 'You think you’re helping anything with this holy crusade?? Go and f****** kill yourself before they come for you!!! People like you should be locked up!' Several people called Elena 'disgusting' and said she would 'burn in hell' for supporting the rights of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community. Although homosexual relationships in Russia were decriminalised in 1993, discrimination still runs rampant. In June 2013, Russian lawmakers in Moscow passed a new law banning the 'propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships' to minors.

"The seven-year-old daughter of a lesbian couple has made a video to help explain to other children who have two mothers how they were created. Sophia breaks down the issue simply for youngsters by explaining the baby-making process in a very cute way. The short film was created by The Next Family, an organisation that supports diverse families. How life begins: Seven-year-old Sophia, the daughter of two moms, made a video to help others understand how her moms had a baby . Simply put: Sophia created some illustrations to help make her point as she addressed the camera . 'If you're a kid with two moms and you don't know how to explain it to other kids or people, this is a video of how you can explain it,' Sophia enthusiastically starts her video. 'Say you have mom, and she was in love with this other mom, and then they married, and then they're going to have a baby. But they need a boy!' Her mother gently guides her as she explains the facts about how 'they call this guy at this place called a sperm donor'. Sophia continues: 'They ask for sperm from him and when he gives it to them and they say thank you, and then he is their invisible – the kid's invisible father and… and, well, that's how they get born. The end.' The video is illustrated by the first-grader, who uses a series of kid-friendly cartoons to depict the process she is describing. Motherly bond: The film was created by The Next Family, an organisation that supports diverse families . Sperm donor: With just a little bit of help from her mum, she explains the facts . Easy conversation: Sophia hopes that it may allow other children from same-sex parent families to understand . The clip may give parents ideas about to how to address some of life's most difficult topics. Parents can find it difficult at the best of times, but in the case of same sex couples, the topic can prove to be even more of a challenge. Yet, Sophia appears to take it all in her stride and despite a few giggles during the video and occasionally struggling to get her words out, she manages to deliver her innocent message. According to the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, there are approximately 594,000 same-sex partner households. Around 27 per cent of those homes have children.","Sophia, the daughter of a lesbian, explains how two mothers are able to have a baby .

"A gun trafficker for convicted killer Aaron Hernandez said he was 'awed' by the former New England Patriots star when he sent him an assault rifle and a pair of handguns a month before Odin Lloyd’s killing. Oscar 'Papoo' Hernandez Jr - no relation to the disgraced NFL player - has pleaded guilty to weapons charges in connection to his infamous namesake’s murder case. Earlier this month, Aaron Hernandez, 25, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for first-degree murder of the semi-professional football player in 2013. Scroll down for video . Bad bro-mance: Oscar Hernandez Jr (left), 24, said he was 'awed' by New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez (right) and 'grateful to be noticed' when the football player paid him $15,000 for three guns . Unfortunate timing: Oscar Hernandez  shipped his namesake a rifle and two handguns in April 2013 - a month before the NFL player shot dead Odin Lloyd (pictured on screen in court) Hernandez had been a rising star in the NFL with a $41million contract when he was arrested in June of that year. In a sentencing memo in Oscar Hernandez’s weapons case released this week to Boston Herald the 24-year-old Florida man stated that he was blinded by the football player's fame ,'grateful to be noticed [by him], and had no way of anticipating the terrible events which would follow.' Although Oscar Hernandez was never called to testify against Aaron Hernandez during his trial earlier this month, his lawyer wrote in the memorandum to Judge William Young that his client was beaten by fellow inmates at the Wyatt Detention Center 'after having been incorrectly listed as a government witness.' Following the attack, Oscar Hernandez spent some time in solitary confinement at the Rhode Island jail. Mr Hernandez, a father from Belle Glen, Florida, is now facing up to 30 months in prison after pleading guilty in January to charges of transporting firearms across state lines; obstruction of justice; lying to a federal grand jury and witness tampering. Justice for Odin: The 25-year-old athlete (left) was found guilty April 15 of first-degree murder in the 2013 shooting death of the semi-professional football player (right) The confessed gun smuggler was scheduled to be sentenced Monday, but Judge Young has delayed the punishment phase until May 5. Public defender Charles McGinty, who represents Hernandez, is seeking a sentence of one year and one day for his client. Investigators said the Florida resident shipped three guns including FEG 7.62x39 Hungarian rifle, to Aaron Hernandez in the spring of 2013. The weapons had been stashed inside a beat-up Toyota Camry that was found in the football player's garage in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. A friend of Oscar Hernandez testified during the NFL star’s trial that the gun trafficker purchased the weapons April 16, 2013, five days after Aaron transferred $15,000 into his account. Oscar Hernandez was arrested April 17, 2014, and indicted by a grand jury in Massachusetts on gun trafficking charges. Back behind bars: Following the sentencing phase, Hernandez was handcuffed and returned to jail. He has since been transferred to a maximum-security facility . The indictment stated that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had traced three guns that had been recovered during the investigation of Odin Lloyd's killing. The ATF determined that all three guns were purchased in Florida in April 2013. Massachusetts officials said they have been unable to find the gun used to kill Lloyd, which they've identified as a .45-caliber Glock. None of the three guns mentioned in Oscar Hernandez's indictment is a .45-caliber Glock. Meanwhile, his notorious namesake was transferred last week to the maximum security state Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley to begin serving his life sentence. Aaron Hernandez is also awaiting a trial date for the 2012 homicides of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado.","Oscar Hernandez Jr has pleaded guilty to transporting firearms, obstruction of justice, lying to a federal grand jury and witness tampering .

"Stranded residents of last week's devastating floods, who were unable to cross the water to attend an Anzac Day memorial service, were thrilled after a cornet player treated them to a rendition of the Last Post from the water's edge. Maitland local Karen Newton, a teacher and former professional musician, had just finished playing at the Kurri Kurri dawn service and was on her way to Gillieston Heights to deliver food to the victims of the floods. When she got to the water's edge at Testers Hollow, Ms Newton plucked her cornet from the car and began playing the bugle call once again, across the water to the isolated residents in a goosebump-inducing moment. Scroll down for video . Maitland local Karen Newton (pictured) performed an impromptu rendition of the Last Post to stranded residents of Gillieston Heights . As the sun rose over the water, Ms Newton could be seen facing five stranded residents, who had come out to pay their respects to the fallen Anzacs in their own unplanned service. Cassandra Winter, who filmed the video and posted it online, said that Ms Newton's act is what Anzac Day is all about. The video, which has over 5,000 views on Facebook, beautifully captures the dawn Anzac Day experience. 'After attending the dawn service at Kurri Kurri, I drove toward Testers Hollow, as I could see it was going to be a beautiful and rare sunrise,' Ms Winter told Daily Mail Australia. 'I decided to capture the sunrise in pictures. As we waited, Karen Newton arrived, (I'm guessing for the same reason) she saw it as a great opportunity to play the bugle over the waters edge. 'It was serene, with the bird life abundant, a peaceful, calm, unhurried moment with the sound of the Last Post drifting along the water to what seemed an endless lake.' Another Facebook user shared the video and commented that the floods would never dampen the community spirit of the people of Gillieston Heights. 'The flood couldn't stop Gillieston Heights paying our respects! Thank you to all who have made today's services happen out here! Lest we forget,' the user said. The residents were separated from the town by massive flood water and were holding their own unplanned service . The moment was all the more poignant and emotional as the residents of the isolated town remembered Gillieston Heights woman Anne Jarmain, who lost her life in the floods last week. The body of Ms Jarmain, 86, was found at 7pm on Wednesday - 10 hours after her car was swept away by raging flood water as she tried to cross Cessnock Road in the NSW Hunter Region. The elderly great-grandmother had just popped out for milk after two days without power and dwindling food supplies. Ms Jarmain was dragged into the waters when she tried to manoeuvre her silver hatchback around a stalled Falcon before 9am on Wednesday. Ms Newton faced the five residents who had come out to see the sun rising on Anzac Day and remembered flood victim Anne Jarmain . Around ten people immediately ran into the water, with four people stripping off and swimming frantically through the icy, fast-moving water. The state's worst storms in a decade  ripped through Sydney and surrounding areas last week with four deaths in the Hunter region. More bad weather is expected later this week, with up to 90mm of rain expected between Friday and Saturday. Cassandra Winter said the bugle music at dawn was a special moment due to all the devastation that the town had suffered in the last week. ‘After the week that had been, with the tragedy of a local woman's death, due to the floods, it was a fitting tribute for the local women, also to SES volunteers, emergency workers and civilians who had worked together tirelessly throughout the region,’ Ms Winter told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Jarmain, 86, lost her life when her car was washed away by flood water as she popped to the shops to get milk . Ms Winter said the town is 'slowly getting back to normal following the floods. 'The process has been lengthy, the people of Gillieston Heights at this time are still stranded along with a few other communities in the Hunter, the people are working together and life is slowly getting back to normal,' she said. She said she is surprised at the response the video has received online and revealed that it has brought many of her friends to tears. 'The amount of people commenting how it had brought them to tears, and wanting to share the video then made me realise people need to see this, she said. 'I'm thankful for the experience, it has captured the true nature of the Australian spirit.' Speaking to the Newcastle Herald, bugle player Ms Newton said she thought of the soldiers who died in Gallipoli and Ms Jarmain as she played the moving song. 'It was a very sobering and sombre experience,' she said . 'I've just been blown away [by the response].'","Stranded victims of the storm were unable to attend an Anzac Day service .

"Hillary Clinton is laughing in the face of the accepted retirement age - currently 65 both in the UK and the US - by aiming to become the leader of the Free World just months before her 70th birthday. If the former U.S. Secretary of State reaches her goal and is sworn in as the 44th President of the United States in January 2017, then she will not only be the country's first female president but also the second oldest, behind Ronald Reagan, ever to open the doors to the White House. Clinton certainly seems to be relishing the life experience that her advancing years have given her. Age is nothing but a number: Hillary Clinton who has launched her campaign to be US president (pictured above, speaking at the Women in the World Conference on April 23) will be 69 when she takes office if successful . Celebrating her advancing years: A black-and-white photograph showing Hillary as a toddler just after the end of the Second World War has been posted on her Twitter feed . A black-and-white image posted on her Twitter account this weekend showed  a very young Clinton pointing at the camera, accompanied by the phrase 'Hillary's counting on you', echoing Lord Kitchener's famous First World War slogan: 'Your country needs you'. It appears the presidential candidate is very much celebrating her age: the image itself would have been shot while Clinton was a toddler just after the end of the Second World War. Elsewhere, Clinton's newfound Grandmother status - her daughter Chelsea gave birth to a daughter, Charlotte, with husband Marc Mezvinsky in September last year - has seen her able to relate to a whole new section of the voting public. Doting...but could Hillary's recent status as a grandmother be a powerful tool in her bid to win votes? Last week, the politician, currently 67, posted the hashtag #GrandmothersKnowBest to her Twitter feed . The hashtag #GrandmothersKnowBest used on Hillary's Twitter page has attracted other grandmothers to post their own posts using it . In a recent Twitter posting promoting vaccines for children, Clinton ended the appeal with the hashtag #GrandmothersKnowBest, which has since seen a stream of grannies from across the globe tweeting their own posts using the hashtag. Clinton is by no means the only high-profile woman refusing to change gear as she gets older; there are a raft of successful female figures continuing to put their foot on the gas and  power their way into the last quarter of their lives. Below, we've outlined some of the world's most influential women whose careers - in everything from fashion to politics - are still flying high after retirement age. ANNA WINTOUR . AGE: 65 . The biggest name in the fashion industry, Anna Wintour has managed to fly high well into her seventh decade despite working in what is regularly deemed the most superficial of industries. Although her Vogue U.S. Editorship has looked a little wobbly over the decades, as the names of new, younger faces have been mooted as possible replacements, Wintour is still very much at the top of the fashion tree. The most powerful woman in fashion: Vogue US Editor Anna Wintour, pictured here between David Beckham (left with daughter Harper) and James Corden (right) in LA on April 16 remains ever influential . Said to be the muse for hit film The Devil Wears Prada, mother-of-two Wintour can be assured of a front row seat at whichever catwalk show she chooses. Celebrity fans include the Beckhams, Roger Federer (the feeling is very much mutual) and Kate Moss. Two years ago, she was named artistic director for the entire Condé Nast publishing empire. DAME JUDI DENCH . AGE: 80 . Long established as a national treasure, Dame Judi Dench will turn 81 in December this year. With a gilded career that stretches six decades behind her, Dench has been vocal about her dislike of the ageing process, saying to U.S. magazine People: 'There’s nothing good about being my age.' She continued: 'Someone said to me, ""You have such a wealth of knowledge,"" and I just said ""I’d rather be young and know nothing, actually."" Bugger the wealth of knowledge.' Despite failing sight which has left her unable to travel alone, the actress is showing no signs of retiring; her latest film The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel has just been released in America. Life begins at 80? Famous octogenarians Judi Dench (left) and baking star Mary Berry (right) have both seen their careers prosper in the twilight of their lives . MARY BERRY . AGE: 80 . Perhaps the key to the longevity of one of the country's most famous bakers is her energy. Slim, sharp and sprightly, Mary Berry has seen her career flourish through the generations with the BBC's Great British Bake Off programme taking her profile to new levels. Born in 1935, Berry has seen every food trend come and go but continues to stay current; with a knack for gently advising younger contestants on the show how best to improve their cakes without leaving them too dejected. Her colourful wardrobe has been copied by women much younger than her 80 years and 181,000 people adore her on Facebook. With spin-off shows planned including Junior Bake Off and regular television and radio appearances, plus a new book, Berry is busier than ever. DIANE VON FURSTENBERG . AGE: 68 . The Belgian-born designer behind the iconic wrap dress currently has 85 shops worldwide and has held the position of president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) since 2006. A supporter of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, Von Furstenberg has spoken about her own views on women in the workplace, saying: 'I never really felt the glass ceiling in fashion; I always felt my being a woman as a strength and as a gift.' The mother and grandmother continues to hold the United Nations DVF awards, which celebrates the achievements of women and said in her 2014 memoir, The Woman I Wanted to be: 'I cannot pretend that I am younger than I am, and truly I feel that I have lived so fully that I should be twice my age.' Fashion designer Diane Von Furstenberg, 68 (left),  has been open about her age, saying 'I feel that I have lived so fully that I should be twice my age' while Miuccia Prada, 65, who owns the famous Italian Prada label, has spoken of her desire to get into politics... MIUCCIA PRADA . AGE: 65 . When you run a global fashion empire, you needn't worry about collecting your pension but Miuccia Prada's career  continues to accelerate. Named the world's 75th most powerful woman in 2014 by Forbes, Prada the brand is worth an estimated $11.1 billion and Miuccia remains one of the highest-paid women in the industry. Joining the family leather handbag business in 1978, she quickly took control and oversaw the brand as it became a global fashion player in the late eighties. She has described the fast-paced fashion industry as like working 'on waves which break really quickly.' Although the Italian designer hasn't been officially involved in politics, it is a passion that she could yet develop. She said in 2011: 'Politics have always been a little of my passion. And now I [could] use my work as a tool to do things other than fashion.' AUNG SAN SUU KYI . AGE: 69 . Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi became famous the world over for her 21-year incarceration in Burma. When her house arrest ended in November 2010, she went on to stand for parliament in the country, winning a landslide victory. Inspiring: Hillary and former Burmese political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi, 69, have both been prolific in their respective political arenas and show no signs of slowing as they approach their eighth decade . In June 2013, the former political prisoner announced that her political desires still burned strongly and that she wanted to run for the Myanmar presidency in 2015. Without the approval of at least one military legislator, it is, however, likely to remain just an ambition. MARGARET CHAN . AGE: 67 . By the time Dr Margaret Chan steps down from her role as Director General of the World Health Organisation in 2017, she will have served ten years in one of the most influential positions in health. Originally from China, Dr Chan was appointed Director of Health of Hong Kong before being elevated to the top position for the WHO in 2006. Dr Chan has had to manage responses to global panics such as SARS, bird flu and Ebola. Forbes lists her as the 30th most powerful woman in the world. Leading the way in the world of health: In the UK Professor Dame Sally Davies, 65, (left) is the Chief Medical Officer while (right) Margaret Chan, 67, has been in charge of the World Health Organisation since 2006 . SALLY DAVIES . AGE: 65 . Birmingham-born Professor Dame Sally Davies is the UK's Chief Medical Officer and can be seen advising the government on everything from three-parent families to the ebola crisis and obesity. A haematologist by trade, she was charged with developing the National Institute for Health Research in 2006, with a £1billion budget. The secret to keeping on top of such a stressful job?

"Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon boasted tonight how a brand-new £1billion hospital in Glasgow had been 'entirely funded' by Scottish taxpayers. Ms Sturgeon said the state-of-the-art South Glasgow University Hospital – which opened today complete with a fleet of robots delivering linen, a children's cinema and helicopter landing pad – proved the SNP's commitment to the NHS. But Ukip said the hospital had been funded with English taxpayers' money 'shovelled' to Holyrood – despite gaping holes in hospital funding south of the border. Scroll down for video . South Glasgow University Hospital opened today complete with a fleet of robots delivering linen, a children's cinema and helicopter landing pad . The UK's newest hospital has been nicknamed the 'Death Star' by locals because of its giant 14-storey star-shaped design, topped by a landing pad for aircraft . The striking atrium reaches up the entire height of the building, which replaces four ageing hospitals across Glasgow, some of which date back to Victorian times . The hospital has an interactive display for children developed with the Glasgow Science Centre . The former head of the NHS Sir David Nicholson delivered a stark warning earlier this month over the black hole in hospital finances. Sir David said there was a 'substantial financial problem' at the heart of the NHS and claimed the financial peril it faces will soon be 'crystal clear'. The NHS will not publish this year's accounts until after the UK general election on May 7. But by December 2014, more than two out of three NHS hospitals were in the red. Last year, nineteen NHS trusts were referred to ministers after auditors raised concerns about their financial health. One of those referred was Hinchingbrooke, which is the first hospital trust to be run by a private firm, Circle. Despite the growing crisis in funding for NHS England, the SNP has demanded even more cash for Scotland. Dr David Stewart, the medical director for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said the South Glasgow University Hospital 'allows us to truly bring healthcare into the 21st Century' SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has claimed the amazing building proves her party's commitment to the NHS . There are self-service check-in machines and nearly all of the 1,100 beds have their own room, with an en-suite bathroom and views out over the city . The super hospital has a cinema and a roof garden in the children's wing and is the latest to be built in the UK . The building's full 14-storeys can be appreciated as soon as patients, visitors and staff enter the atrium . The hospital cost £842m but the medical equipment inside has brought the final total closer to £1billion . Public funding north of the border is typically 20 per cent higher than in England – with Scots receiving an extra £1,200 on their health care alone. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, appearing on BBC Newsnight tonight, defended the scale of public funding north of the border - and vowed to push for even more . Last year, nineteen NHS trusts were referred to ministers after auditors raised concerns about their financial health. One of those referred was Hinchingbrooke, which is the first hospital trust to be run by a private firm, Circle . Public funding north of the border is typically 20 per cent higher  than in England – with Scots receiving an extra £1,200 on their health care alone. The average public spending per person in the UK is just under £9,000 – but only £8,700 in England. This compares with some £10,275 in Scotland. Wales, meanwhile, receives £10,000 – while Northern Ireland gets £11,000, the highest across the UK. Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Cambridgeshire was the first NHS hospital to be taken over by private management in 2012. It entered into an agreement with Circle, an organisation of private healthcare consultants, after facing closure. But in January bosses announced the hospital was to return to NHS management after a Care Quality Commission report deemed it 'inadequate'. It was placed into special measures alongside 19 of the country's most crisis-hit facilities as a result of the inspection. But insiders expressed concern the inspection was the product of Labour supporters trying to negatively portray the privatisation of the NHS. The Mail repeatedly highlighted concerns by MPs and doctors that the inspection was flawed and a sabotage attempt by those opposed to privatisation. One of the inspectors was a member of the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public while another was a senior figure in the British Medical Association, the doctors' trade union, who had previously spoken out about the dangers of private firms' involvement in the NHS. Since the initial report the hospital's status has been upgraded to 'Requires Improvement'. Following Circle's announcement that it had withdrawn from the contract it was returned to NHS management. Scotland is guaranteed extra public funding by the controversial Barnett formula used by the Treasury to dole out taxpayers' money around the UK. Despite receiving thousands of pounds more per person already, Ms Sturgeon this morning vowed to use any influence after the election to push for more even public spending in Scotland. The SNP manifesto also calls for even more health spending over the next five years – vowing to wring out an extra £9.5billion from UK taxpayers every year by 2020. This would mean a total increase for Scotland's NHS of £2billion. Ms Sturgeon this afternoon defended the level of health spending north of the border – by pointing to the new Glasgow super hospital. The South Glasgow University Hospital – the UK's newest hospital – has been nicknamed the 'Death Star' by locals because of its giant 14-storey star-shaped design, topped by a landing pad for aircraft. The hospital cost £842m but the medical equipment inside has brought the final total closer to £1billion. There are self-service check-in machines, and nearly all of the 1,100 beds have their own room, while a fleet of robots deliver linen and other goods via a network of underground tunnels. The hospital replaces four ageing hospitals across Glasgow, some of which date back to Victorian times. Dr David Stewart, the medical director for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the hospital 'allows us to truly bring healthcare into the 21st Century'. But a Ukip spokesman told MailOnline the hospital has been built using English money. He said the people of Glasgow were 'very lucky to have their new hospital'. But he added: 'The people of England and Wales should be proud of the contributions they have made to it, while not funding their own public services to the same degree'. It comes after Nigel Farage used the 'challengers' TV debates to attack the Barnett formula used for dishing out cash around the UK. He said: 'We've had enough of shovelling all that money over Hadrian's Wall.' It also comes amid growing pressure on English hospitals' finances, amid warnings of a financial 'black hole'. Former NHS chief Sir David Nicholson said there was a 'substantial financial problem' at the heart of the NHS and claimed the financial peril it faces will soon be 'crystal clear'","A new £1bn super hospital in Glasgow opened its doors to patients today .

"A family have claimed the body of an infant who was discovered deceased and buried on a Sydney beach last year, in order to give her a proper funeral. On November 30, 2014, two young boys were playing on Maroubra Beach when they uncovered the body of a baby girl buried under 30 centimetres of sand. Now locals Filomena D'Alessandro and Bill Green have claimed the infant's body in order to provide her with a fitting farewell. 'We’re local and my husband is a police officer and he’s worked with many of the officers investigating it,' Ms D'Alessandro told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . A Sydney family have claimed the body of a baby girl who was found buried on Maroubra Beach (pictured) on November 30, 2014 . Filomena D'Alessandro and Bill Green have claimed the infant's remains, who they have named Lily Grace, in order to provide her with a fitting farewell . 'Above all as a mother I wanted to do something for that little girl,' she added. Since January the couple, who were married last year and have three children between them, have been trying to claim the baby after they heard police were going to give her a 'destitute burial'. 'The most frustrating part has been the wait and we didn't know when it was going to happen.' With the help of the local community they managed to raise enough funds to provide the baby girl, who they have named Lily Grace, with a funeral, even though they were 'prepared to pay for the funeral on our own'. Ms D'Alessandro said the Maroubra community were rocked by the discovery of the little girl's body last year. 'It’s terrible, we had just heard about the other baby who had been dumped the week before in Quakers Hill. Despite a lengthy investigation NSW Police were unable to locate the family of the abandoned baby . The 'very small' infant was dug up about 50 metres away from the closest footpath leading off the beach . Lifeguards assisted police at the crime scene: Officers dressed in full protective gear and masks removed the body at about 1pm . 'And to have it happen in Maroubra, it was just so shocking,' she said. A service will be held for Lily Grace on Wednesday at the South Chapel at the Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park, and Ms D'Alessandro and Mr Green have asked anyone still wishing to donate to instead give money to the Royal Women’s Hospital. They will also be collecting funds from the Maroubra woman's workplace at Raine and Horne, and at the service this week to go towards the hospital. 'I think it’s going to be very lovely, everyone’s come together to put it together,' Ms D'Alessandro said of the upcoming funeral. The body of the baby girl, whose mother was never found, was discovered by two boys aged six and seven who were playing in the sand after their Nippers session. Aged six and seven, the two boys found the 'very small' infant while digging in the sand during their weekly Sunday morning session at the southern end of Maroubra Beach in Sydney's eastern suburbs. Maroubra Surf Life Saving is providing counselling for the two boys who discovered the body as well as other surf club members . At the time Inspector Andrew Holland urged the mother of the child to come forward and seek medical assistance . For some time the sex and age of the child was unable to be determined due to decompostion . Police were called to the scene at about 10:05am on November 30 to investigate the 'suspicious' incident. Officers dressed in full protective gear and masks removed the body by about 1pm on the same day. At the time Inspector Andrew Holland urged the mother of the child to come forward and seek medical assistance. Police are also trawled through hospital, and deaths, births and marriages records in the hope of identifying the baby. The grisly discovery came just over a week after a newborn boy was found abandoned in a 2.4 metre deep drain in Quakers Hill. A post mortem examination will be conducted to establish the cause of the child's death . Patrol Captain for Maroubra Surf Life Saving, Phil Dutton, said a lot of suspicious activity happens on the south end of Maroubra Beach and called for the installation of CCTV cameras . The mayor of Randwick City Council, Ted Seng,  said: 'South Maroubra is one of our more isolated beaches, but it is patrolled by Randwick Council Lifeguards and volunteer surf life savers from South Maroubra Surf Life Saving Club' There are also serious concerns for the wellbeing of the two young boys who found the decomposed remains. 'It's horrible, just awful,' a witness, Monica, said. 'The under six Nippers were digging in the sand and they found it,' one surf lifesaver, who did not wish to be named, told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's just awful. It will have traumatised the poor the kids for life, no matter how much counselling they get.' 'It hits so close to home. Especially after that baby was found in a drain last week,' the lifesaver added. Maroubra Surf Life Saving is providing counselling for the two boys who discovered the body, as well as other surf club members. The surf lifesaver also mentioned that the far south and north ends of the beach can be troublesome areas, saying that the lack of light or any kind of surveillance meant they attracted some questionable behaviour.

"An Oregon teenager was arrested after allegedly hitting a pedestrian with her car and fleeing the scene. Miranda Ashley Calvin, 19, was arrested by Gresham police on Sunday afternoon. Police were called to a Gresham road at about 8.30pm on Saturday night where they found 49-year-old Jerrie Ann Hornig dead when they arrived. Miranda Ashley Calvin, 19, of Gresham, Oregon, was arrested on Sunday afternoon after allegedly hitting a woman with her car and fleeing the scene . The woman Calvin allegedly hit was 49-year-old Jerrie Ann Horning. When police arrived at the scene at about 8.30pm on Saturday night, she was found dead . A white Mercedes Benz had been spotted fleeing the scene and was later seen by a person who was listening to a police scanner, which led to Calvin's arrest, according to Oregon Live. Gresham police said that tips from the public helped lead to the teenager's arrest, who was found by police at a Marriott Hotel in Clackamas. Calvin was arrested and booked into Multnomah County Detention Center on manslaughter, felony hit-and-run and reckless driving. Her arraignment hearing will be later this week. Hornig's son Maxwell Horning posted a status on Facebook remembering his mother after the incident. Horning, pictured here with her son Maxwell Horning, was a pedestrian when she was hit by a car on Saturday night . 'I got the worst new of my life at 1Am last night,' he said. 'My mom was hit and killed by a hit and run driver.' He wrote that it still feels 'unreal like being trapped in a bad dream you can't escape from but she is in a better place enjoying her new life with old friends and family'.

"A French artist has given a seedy and derelict motel a makeover by painting the entire property - including its palm trees - a dazzling bright white. Vincent Lamouroux publicly unveiled the project, named 'Projections' in LA's trendy Silver Lake neighborhood and it instantly became a hit with passers-by who stopped to take photos. Mr Lamouroux used an environmentally friendly limewash to coat the so-called Bates Motel, including several towering palm trees and the fence around the rundown property. Dazzling: French artist Vincent Lamouroux has painted a derelict motel in LA's trendy Silver Lake neighborhood completely white, even coating the palm trees . The seedy motel, which has been closed for years, was actually named the Sunset Pacific Motel but got its nickname from its proximity to nearby Bates Avenue and its passing resemblance to the motel in the Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece 'Psycho'. Paris resident Mr Lamouroux said: 'The idea behind this project was to cover the entire building and to think about the building as a giant sculpture (on) the scale of the urban landscape. 'With this idea we could provoke ... a strong change in order to create some attention.' Mr Lamouroux has made frequent trips to Los Angeles over the past 15 years. He said he chose white because it 'could bring the most light and could cause a sort of bedazzlement.' Complete whitewash: A man carries paint pots while walking through the interior of what used to be known as Bates Motel due its proximity to nearby Bates Avenue and its passing resemblance to the motel in the Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece 'Psycho' Attracting attention:  A passer-by stops to take a picture following the unveiling of the 'projections' prokject yesterday in LA . Explaining the name Projections, he said explained that it refers to the process of spraying the lime wash onto the building - but also that the viewer is able to project ideas and imagination on to the surfaces of the motel. He said: 'It also creates something rather positive; perhaps the idea of a blank projection screen for our desires and wants, and for all our imaginings.' The installation is the culmination of two years work and will be guarded for two weeks before the weather and graffiti artists inevitably reclaim the building. Speaking to LA Observed, he added: 'It was a long process, but not that hard. 'I like the idea that we were able to have around us people who were believers about it. 'It's a great thing to be able to share a dream, starting from an idea and transforming it into a reality. For me, this project is an awakened dream that has turned into reality.' The motel is eventually expected to be torn down and replaced with a new development. Tall order: The huge palm trees surrounding the formerly derelict motel were even coated with white paint .

"If a picture is worth a thousand words, then Jonathon Keats figures a picture can also span a thousand years. Keats, a San Francisco writer and self-described experimental philosopher and conceptual artist, has designed a 'millennium camera' that he intends to mount in a churchless steeple on a college campus. He hopes the resulting photograph will chronicle climate change by taking a 1,000-year exposure of a western Massachusetts mountain range. Jonathan Keats, an experimental philosopher, hopes to capture 1,000 years of changes at a mountain range in Massachusetts with his 'millennium camera' The camera, which is made of cooper and allows light to enter through a tiny hole and change paint inside, will create one image that Keats says will display centuries of changes to the environment . If it seems far-fetched, consider that some of Keats' previous endeavors include selling tracts of real estate in the theoretical extra dimensions of space-time and opening a photosynthetic restaurant that serves gourmet sunlight to plants. He has also been involved in choreographing honeybees; copyrighting his own mind to give his 'intellectual property' a 70-year post-life extension; and, controversially, joining in a bid to genetically engineer God. Even at his quirkiest, Keats notes he always has a serious message to deliver. In the case of the millennium camera — a cylindrical device small and light enough to hold in one hand but hopefully durable enough to survive the centuries — it's encouraging people to think beyond their own human lifespan to what geologists call deep time, the lengthy periods in which the world changes on a grand scale. 'We need to find a way to think in deep time if we are to responsibly make use of the technologies we have,' he says. 'So the camera is intended, in a sense, as a mental prosthesis, as a way of creating some sort of a feedback loop in deep time, where setting up the camera now, looking out into the far future, allows for people who are alive in the far future to see the decisions we made through the effect that they had.' But will it work? The camera will be place on the Stearns Steeple, and the Mead Art Museum at Amherst plans on holding an exhibition to show the resulting photo in the 3015 . Keats hopes that the long-term photograph will make people think about time frames longer than their lives, such as the centuries that it takes for nature such as the Holyoke mountain range (pictured) to transform . Even Keats can't say for sure. Nor is he certain humans will be around in 3015. Nor, assuming they are, that someone will know to retrieve the camera and open it. A thousand years is, after all, a long time. In 1015, the Norman conquest of England was still more than 50 years away, the first crusade was more than 80 years away, and Columbus would not reach the New World for another 477 years. The camera, Keats explains, is very simple, so simple that nothing mechanically should fail. 'Which of course is the wrong thing to say, because then it will,' he quickly adds. It begins as the old science fair standby, the pinhole camera, which allows light to enter through a tiny aperture. But since pinhole cameras aren't designed to last a thousand years, Keats made his of copper because of its resistance to corrosion. The pinhole he pierced through a rugged 24-karat gold plate. To capture the exposure, Keats adapted a Renaissance art technique by using rose madder, a sturdy, organic-based oil paint, applied directly to the copper in the back of the camera. Digital photography was impractical, and he ruled out using film because it would deteriorate too quickly and besides, there's always the chance by 3015 that society will revert to another dark age, without photochemical processing skills. 'All you have to do is open up the camera and you'll see the image,' Keats says. That image will be of the Holyoke Range, a modest but picturesque mountain chain that scientists believe has existed for 200 million years. What a denizen of the 31st century would see is not a before-and-after image, not what today we might call time-lapse photography, but rather one picture depicting a millennium of change. For example, if the now heavily forested area were to gradually turn to grasslands, the trees, Keats predicts, will linger on the photograph as ghostly reminders of a prior period, set against the bolder outline of the more recent landscape. 'So what you're getting in a sense is ... a movie of the full period, of the full thousand years, but all compressed into a single frame,' he says. Stearns Steeple at bucolic Amherst College, where Keats studied philosophy in the 1990s, will serve as the camera's tripod of sorts. Keats says that his ambitious project to make people think about 'deep time' may be a failure. Above, he explains his project at Amherst College . The philosopher and journalist hopes that citizens of the 31st century will look at his image taken from a camera on Stearns Steeple at Amherst College . Once part of Stearns Church, the Gothic Revival steeple was retained as a freestanding structure after the church was demolished in 1949. Keats hopes such resiliency bodes well for its long-term survival. The camera is currently on display steps away from the steeple at the school's Mead Art Museum, where it has generated a mix of interest and skepticism from visitors, according to the museum's curator, Vanja Malloy. 'It might seem silly, and people might say, 'What's the point of a camera with an exposure you'll never see in your lifetime, what's the point of any of it?'' Malloy says. 'But the fact that it is provocative in that way is what's so powerful about it.' Later this spring, Keats will ascend a harrowing set of wooden stairs inside the dusty steeple, position the camera and open its shutter, beginning what he believes will be history's longest exposure. He hasn't sought a patent for the device, which he estimates costs about $100 in raw materials to build, saying he wants others to copy it and place their own millennium cameras strategically around the world. 'I'm well overstating the case for these cameras,' he concedes. 'I realize (it) may seem like a supreme act of egotism. It's probably also an extreme act of naivety on my part. But I think you just have to give it a try.' He says it may take 10,000 years for humanity perfect the process of 1,000-year photos. The philosopher set up a similar 1,000-year camera at the Arizona State University Art Museum's sculpture garden as part of an effort to capture how the next millennium change Tempe, Arizona. The Amherst museum and the Arizona museum both plan to exhibit the photographs in 3015. He also gave 100-year cameras to some resident of Berlin, Germany, last year, he told Big Think.","Jonathon Keats, experimental philosopher, plans to photo Holyoke Range .

"A Holocaust survivor who last week forgave a 93-year-old former SS officer - known as the 'bookkeeper of death' - has angered her fellow plaintiffs by saying he should not be prosecuted. Eva Mozes Kor, 81, who publicly embraced Oskar Groening in court last week in an extraordinary act of forgiveness, called for the prosecutions of former SS officers to end. By doing so, she faced criticism from her co-plaintiffs in the case who suggested she should not have taken part in the trial in Germany. Scroll down for video . Embrace: Seventy years after Auschwitz was liberated, Eva Kor embraced former Nazi guard Oskar Groening . Survivor: Eva Kor spoke of how Josef Mengele stood over her bed and laughed when she was injected with a 'deadly germ' Regret: Groening (pictured) described in chilling detail Wednesday how cattle cars full of Jews were brought to the Auschwitz death camp, the people stripped of their belongings and then  led directly into gas chambers . Mrs Kor made her comments during a television appearance last night discussing the purpose of the trial. She argued that any Nazis still alive should instead come forward to speak publicly about what they did to help counter the threat of neo-Nazi Holocaust deniers in Germany. In response, her co-plaintiffs released a statement through their lawyers today saying: 'Our clients would not comment here – who better than a survivor of Auschwitz knows that everyone needs to find their own way to overcome their suffering – if Mrs Kor did not repeatedly stage her 'forgiveness' publicly. 'The subject of this criminal procedure is NOT that Mr Groening has done anything personally to Mrs Kor or any of the other co-plaintiffs. 'Whether it is Mrs Kor's place to forgive Mr Groening's participation in the murder of her relatives is up to everyone to decide for themselves. 'But if Mrs Kor says ""these prosecutions must stop"" then she should not have become a co-plaintiff.' The statement added: 'We cannot forgive Mr Groening his participation in the murder of our relatives and another 299,000 people – especially since he feels free from any legal guilt. 'We want justice and we welcome the resolution that this trial brings.' Justice: Mrs Kor's co-plaintiffs said they could not forgive Mr Groening for his participation in the murders . In court in Luneburg last Wednesday Mrs Kor detailed how she and her twin sister Miriam were forced to endure horrifying medical experiments at Auschwitz by Josef Mengele, known as the 'Angel of Death'. She told the hearing how they evaded being gassed on arrival at the death camp thanks to Mengele's twisted obsession with twins. He experimented on twins in a sickening attempt to develop genetic techniques for Hitler's dream of creating a 'pure' Aryan race. Mengele used 1,500 sets of twins in his experiments, and only an estimated 180 to 250 individuals survived. Despite her ordeal, Mrs Kor found the compassion to forgive her Nazi tormentors - and even unofficially adopted the grandson of SS commander Rudolf Hoess, who oversaw the murder of more than 1 million people at Auschwitz. Liberation: Auschwitz survivors  during the first hours of the concentration camp's liberation in January 1945 . Chilling: A sign over the Auschwitz camp reads 'Arbeit Macht Frei' meaning 'Work makes you free' She spoke after giving evidence against the former Nazi SS guard Groening for his alleged complicity in the murder of 300,000 Hungarian Jewish prisoners at the death camp in the summer of 1944. As a qualified bookkeeper, it was his job to sort and store the Jews' money that the Nazis kept. After giving evidence, she approached and embraced Groening, but added: 'My forgiveness does not absolve the perpetrator from taking responsibility for his actions. Neither does it diminish my need to know what happened there.' She claims Groening was so overwhelmed by her unexpected gesture that he fainted. Asked why she had hugged him, she said it had not been planned and added: 'I wanted to thank him for having some human decency in accepting responsibility for what he has done. 'I was always interested in meeting him face to face because I believe that there is a human interaction that I cannot predict and no one else can predict.' She added: 'I don't forget what they have done to me. But I am not a poor person – I am a victorious woman who has been able to rise above the pain and forgive the Nazis.' Mrs Kor later tweeted: 'I met Oskar Groening, introduced myself reached to shake his hand-he grabbed my arm & fainted-I screamed 4 help. It was a strange reaction!!' Both Mrs Kor's parents and two older sisters were killed at the camp. In 1984 she founded the organization CANDLES (an acronym for 'Children of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly Lab Experiments Survivors'), through which she located 122 other living Mengele twins, as the experiment survivors came to be known.","Eva Mozes Kor, 81, called for the prosecutions of former SS officers to end .

"Ed Miliband has been 'bullied' by the Conservatives into ruling out a coalition deal between the SNP and Labour, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon claimed tonight. Scotland's First Minister said the Labour leader had allowed himself to be 'kicked around' by the Tories and called on him to be 'tougher' and 'bolder'. With polls suggesting no one party will have a majority after May 7 and support for the SNP hitting a record high, the Conservatives have ramped up warnings about a post-election deal between Labour and the Scottish nationalists. Scotland's First Minister, appearing on Newsnight tonight, said the Labour leader had allowed himself to be 'kicked around' by the Tories and called on him to be 'tougher' and 'bolder' She told Evan Davis that Ed Miliband had been 'bullied' by the Conservatives into ruling out a coalition deal . Labour leader Mr Miliband insisted at the weekend that he is 'not interested in deals' with the SNP. In the latest of BBC1's series of leader interviews with Evan Davis, Ms Sturgeon said Westminster politicians were in danger of being 'insulting' to Scottish voters. She said: 'I've not ruled anything out here, I've always said a coalition with Labour is highly unlikely, Ed Miliband has since said the same because he's been sort of bullied by the Tories to rule these things out.' The SNP leader said she had not ruled out a confidence and supply deal between the two parties. When it was put to her that Mr Miliband had, she said: 'I think what he says the morning after the election will probably be different to what he says now. 'He's in an election campaign, he's trying to cling to the pretence that he is going to get a majority. Everyone else knows that's not looking likely. 'But what I am saying is I think a vote-by-vote arrangement is both most likely and probably the way in which a big team of SNP MPs can wield maximum influence for Scotland's benefit.' The SNP have soared in the polls to a record 54 per cent - while Labour have seen their support cut in half since 2010 . Labour Party leader Ed Miliband delivers a speech at The ARC Theatre & Arts Centre in Stockton-on-Tees today . Commenting further on Mr Miliband, she added: 'I think he should be a bit tougher in not being kicked around so much by the Tories. 'I think he should be bolder in saying that he will respect the wishes of voters because there is a more fundamental point than just how people in Scotland vote.' A Conservative spokesman said Ms Sturgeon's interview exposed the threat posed by the SNP. He said: 'Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed that she now has Ed Miliband wrapped around her little finger - and will use SNP MPs to 'wield maximum influence for Scotland's benefit'. That means more debt, higher taxes, unlimited welfare handouts and weaker defence - so we'll all pay. The only way to stop this happening is to vote Conservative on May 7th.'","SNP leader said Ed Miliband had allowed himself to be 'kicked around'

"A nurse has been suspended after she removed the alarm buzzer from a brain-damaged patient and told a disciplinary hearing she 'wasn't interested' in the case. Vanessa Kennard was suspended in her absence by the Nursing and Midwifery Council after failing to turn up at the hearing. She was one of three nurses charged with mistreating Grant Clarke, 45, at a rehabilitation unit at Sevenoaks Hospital in Kent. The father-of-three suffered a massive brain haemorrhage in May 2012, which left him paralysed on his life side, incontinent and unable to swallow or communicate. Grant Clarke, 45, suffered a brain haemorrhage in May 2012. It left him paralysed on his left side, incontinent and unable to swallow or communicate . Vanessa Kennard, one of the nurses caring for Mr Clarke at the West Kent Neuro-rehabilitation unit at Sevenoaks Hospital, has been suspended from her role for six months after being charged with misconduct . His family became concerned when they visited him at the West Kent Neuro-rehabilitation unit and discovered he smelled of urine and was becoming more and more depressed. His partner Binny Moore planted a secret camera in an iPod docking station. The footage captured revealed the shocking extent of neglect Mr Clarke was subjected to. It showed him looking on helplessly as one nurse dug into his feeding tubes with a biro pen, while another clip showed Ms Kennard pulling a help buzzer from his hands. Mr Clarke, a former IT company director, was also subjected to 'appalling' treatment and left in urine-soaked sheets, covered in faeces. Staff at the rehabilitation unit were also shown giving Mr Clarke drinks, despite him being strictly nil by mouth. When Ms Moore attempted to speak to a nurse about her partner's 'unacceptable care' she was allegedly told, 'point taken, but do bear in mind that we have eight other patients'. Mr Clarke, from West Kingsdown, was only moved to another unit after his family showed the footage to police, and he was removed from the unit under a court order. As a result of the filming, Ms Kennard, and her fellow nurses Marie Banwell and Sarah Corter, were all charged with misconduct. Ms Kennard faced 10 counts, including the removal of Mr Clarke's help buzzer, and telling Ms Moore her partner was too 'buzzer happy'. Concerned that Mr Clarke was being mistreated, his partner Binny Moore and family planted a secret camera in his room. It captured footage of Ms Kennard and colleagues failing to provide the accepted standard of care for Mr Clarke. One nurse was filmed cleaning his feeding tube with a pen, pictured . Ms Moore, pictured left, complained to the Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust 26 times - 22 of those complaints were upheld . But the Nursing and Midwifery Council tribunal hearing in London was told Ms Kennard was not interested in the case, and 'doesn't care what happens'. The panel imposed an interim six-month suspension order in her absence. Deputy ward manager Ms Banwell admitted 13 charges but denies nine others - including one of cleaning the patient's feed tube with a biro pen. Ms Coulter, a ward manager, has admitted 13 charges and denies four others. The two-week fitness to practise hearing has concluded and the panel is still considering the cases against Ms Coulter and Ms Banwell. Mr Clarke's family complained to the trust 26 times - 22 of which were upheld. Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust said it was 'appalled' by what happened and suspended the nurses immediately in November 2012. The hearing will resume in July.","Grant Clarke, 45, was left brain-damaged after a brain haemorrhage in 2012 .

"From underground bunkers and tactical bicycles to heavily armored vehicles, they were taught new ways to deal with a zombie apocalypse or a  natural disaster - and also met some TV stars. Hundreds of survivalists and so-called 'Preppers', of all ages and levels of 'experience', descended on the Salt Lake City, Utah, suburb of Sandy on Friday for the nation's first ever PrepperCon. During the two-day expo, they were shown specially-equipped underground bunkers, learned new methods of storing food, tried out solar powered flashlights - and even dressed up as zombies.

Scott Stallings, one of PrepperCon's founders, said the event was inspired by ComicCon's success, adding that he had amped up the entertainment with the hope of attracting younger attendees. He said that Utah made sense for America's first expo because of the Mormon culture's emphasis on food storage and self-reliance. Among the expo's main events was a zombie costume contest. 'In the prepping industry, we look at zombies as a metaphor,' said Mr Stallings, who lives in Murray. 'Anyone that's coming to take away your stuff, your safety, inflict harm on your family.' Vendors who filled the South Towne Expo Center on Friday and Saturday showed off an array of gear to help people survive a zombie apocalypse, a natural disaster or life in the wilderness. This gear included knives of all shapes and sizes, hi-tech gadgets, food storage units, first aid supplies and armored trucks. There were also live demonstrations and the survival cooking contest.

Following PrepperCon, Miller, 15, told KUTV that she thought the expo had been 'really cool' and that Salt Lake City was a 'gorgeous' region. 'I enjoy meeting the fans and getting their perspective on the show,' she added. The North Carolina teenager was joined at the event on Saturday by her co-star, Theo Crane. Celebrity survival expert Mykel Hawke, a retired U.S. Army Special Forces officer who is best known for his role on the reality TV series 'Man, Woman, Wild', also made an appearance.

Broga celebrates the physical over the spiritual, and . strength over flexibility. Experts say it sets men free to flex . tight hamstrings without hearing invocations to Hindu deities or . feeling inept next to a woman twisted like a pretzel. Scroll down for video . Yoga for men: From downward dog to warrior pose, Broga is becoming increasingly popular thanks to its ‘rugged’ approach to traditional yoga workouts . Making a point: Traditionally seen as an exercise regime for women, yoga is changing and now has a more universal appeal . 'I consider myself an athletic guy, but have never been . flexible and didn't like the thought of embarrassing myself in . front of a group of women,' said financial analyst and Broga enthusiast Eric Wright, . 22, from San Jose, California.

Grokker founder and CEO Lorna Borenstein said more men . are adding yoga to their exercise routines as a cross-training . tool for flexibility and improving recovery time. Even if they spend most of their time focusing on more high intensity gym training, men are now using yoga as a useful warm-up method. 'Men are a little late to the party,' she said. 'But we're . seeing more men in the workplace who find time to do yoga . together a few times a week.' Yoga instructor Robert Sidoti, based in Martha's Vineyard, .

Popular: More gyms are devoting resources and dedicated studio space to Broga programs . 'A lot of guys were saying 'I can't touch my knees, let alone my toes. I would never go to a mostly women class and do things I'm no good at,' said Sidoti, whose sequences are designed with men's bodies in mind. 'We rarely go into poses that require deep forward bending, . twisting and binding,' he said, adding that a High Intensity Interval . Training (HIIT) sequence is included in his standard workout. Broga talk is also anatomically driven, rather than focusing on the mind and the soul like many traditional yoga classes do. 'It's not so much about feeling your heart center as feeling . the stretch across your chest,' Sidoti explained.

"Mark Lawson, 44, (pictured) was spared jail today after stabbing a colleague with a steak knife in a bizarre argument about onion rings . A pub diner who stabbed a work colleague in the leg with a steak knife in a row over his onion rings was spared jail today. Builder Mark Lawson, 44, was in The Diamond Tap public house in Newbury, Berkshire for his Christmas party when he agreed that his co-worker Simon Myers could take some chips from his plate. However, when Mr Myers started eating an onion ring, Lawson was angered, shouted at his victim and drove the knife into his thigh. Simon Blackford, for the prosecution, told Reading Crown Court that Lawson had been drinking with his colleagues at the festive party when he ordered a burger, chips and onion rings. He said: 'The defendant ordered a burger and chips and onion rings and some of his colleagues, including Mr Myers, took an onion ring and that gave rise to a somewhat explosive reaction. 'The defendant said ""don't you come between me and my onion rings"" and there was clearly some talk about that.' However, one of two colleagues, including Mr Myers then joked about taking more of his onion rings. At that point, Lawson 'reacted in a very loud way' to what was happening and stabbed Mr Myers with the steak knife he was clutching. The knife tore into Mr Myers's leg, causing a bloody wound nearly two inches deep, in front of the pub full of horrified onlookers on December 19 last year. Speaking for the defence, John Simmons said that Lawson had been battling a drinking problem and even visited Alcohol Anonymous for a short while to steer clear of the booze. Mr Simmons said Lawson, who lives in Thatcham in Berkshire, had been clean for six months and his decision to drink was a 'one-off' that he deeply regretted. 'This is an incident that started out as a joke but didn't end up that way', he added. 'Before this Christmas party he was almost minded not to attend and now of course regrets the fact he did. 'He hasn't drunk from that day to this.' Lawson 'reacted in a very loud way' when colleagues, including Mr Myers, stole his onion rings from his plate . Lawson took offence to his work colleagues attempting to steal his onion rings . The court heard Lawson was an exemplary employee who worked six days a week at a construction site at Newbury Racecourse. 'He comes across as an extremely affable, very likeable man,' said Mr Simmons. 'He is clearly a very hard working man and cannot believe how much trouble he has got himself into. He realises he is someone who just cannot drink.' Appealing for a suspended jail sentence, Mr Simmons told the court Lawson had apologised to Mr Myers and the two had been very mature about the unsavoury episode. Recorder Patrick Hamlin accused Lawson of putting his steady job and working life in jeopardy by drinking too much and carrying out the 'bizarre' attack. 'You were in trouble with the police and the courts quite a lot when you were younger but for the last 20 years you have stayed well clear of trouble,' he said. 'You have kept a steady job, you are working long hours usually six days a week. You put that all in jeopardy when at a Christmas function last year you drank too much. 'You lost your temper with a fellow employee over a bizarre issue - the stealing or a joke about stealing the onion rings from your plate. You were incensed by that conduct and you stabbed your fellow employee in the leg.' At a Christmas party last year at the Diamond Tap Wetherspoons in Newbury, Berkshire (pictured), Lawson stabbed his colleague Mr Myers with a steak knife following a row over his onion rings . However Recorder Hamlin spared him jail and sentenced him to a six-month prison sentence suspended for a year as well as a 12-month curfew. 'I am not regarding this as a case, that happens unhappily so often, when someone goes out armed and for a fight,' he added. 'This is a case where you had a knife in your hand simply to eat your meal. It is an unusual case. You acted out of character.' He also ordered Lawson to pay £250 in compensation to Mr Myers and £350 towards prosecution costs. Lawson had admitted one count of unlawful wounding, but denied wounding with intent. Recorder Patrick Hamlin told Reading Crown Court (pictured) that Lawson put his job in jeopardy when he 'drank too much' at a Christmas function in December last year .","Simon Myers had asked Mark Lawson if he could have some of his chips .

"Nicola Sturgeon scoffed at Ed Miliband’s attempts to rule out a post-election pact with the Scottish National Party last night as she said Labour had no chance of winning a majority on its own. The Scottish First Minister, whose party is on course for a landslide north of the border, said the Labour leader would soon ‘change his tune’. Mr Miliband yesterday insisted he would not agree to a ‘confidence and supply’ deal with the SNP, who look set to deprive his party of an outright win and could hold the balance of power. Scroll down for video . Could hold the balance of power: Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (left), whose party is on course for a landslide north of the border, said Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) would soon ‘change his tune’ Religious visit: Mr Miliband and his wife Justine meet Hindu devotees at the Shree Swaminarayan Temple in Willesden Green, north-west London, yesterday . But he again refused to rule out relying on SNP votes to pass key legislation. Critics said that would mean a weak Labour government having to negotiate day in, day out with SNP MPs. Miss Sturgeon has previously ruled out a formal coalition, but said she will seek to put Mr Miliband in No 10 even if Labour finishes 40 seats behind the Conservatives in a hung Parliament. Yesterday a YouGov/Sunday Times poll suggested the SNP could win 46 of Scotland’s 59 seats – up from just six at present. Miss Sturgeon told LBC Radio: ‘What Ed Miliband has got to recognise [is that] in a minority parliament, he won’t have the votes simply to say that he is going to do what he likes come what may. Balancing act: Miss Sturgeon visits Jump Gymnastics community club in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire . 'Economic risk': London Mayor Boris Johnson (left) told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that there is 'no way Miliband (right) could conceivably govern except with the help of the SNP' ‘He is trying to continue to pretend that he is going to have a majority, and he is in danger, I think, of giving the impression that he doesn’t have very much respect for democracy, or for the votes of the Scottish people. Ramped up warnings: Home Secretary Theresa May . ‘If the verdict of the people is to give neither of the big parties a majority ... my message to Ed Miliband remains as it has always been – if we have got an anti-Tory majority, if we work together, we can lock the Tories out.’ The Conservatives yesterday ramped up their warnings over a Labour-SNP deal. Home Secretary Theresa May said Britain would face its gravest constitutional crisis since the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII. She added that English voters would not accept Scottish MPs having power over crucial issues in their lives. And London Mayor Boris Johnson told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘There is no way Miliband could conceivably govern except with the help of the SNP – they’d be crouching on his back like a monkey. 'The SNP pushing him even further to the Left would be a real economic risk for this country.’ Asked on the Andrew Marr Show if he thought he could win the election in Scotland, despite polls putting Labour more than 20 points behind, Mr Miliband said: ‘I think we can.’ He said he had ‘made it clear we’re not interested’ in deals, such as a ‘confidence and supply’ arrangement where the SNP would agree to back Labour on important votes such as the Budget. But he refused to rule out relying on SNP votes for key legislation.

In a series of campaign videos and speeches, a string of SNP candidates have issued blood-curdling threats in recent weeks – and warned that they will push Ed Miliband even further to the Left. Tommy Sheppard, the party’s candidate in Edinburgh East, boasted that last year’s independence referendum ‘sent the British Establishment a message and gave them a shock’, adding: ‘On May 7 we can visit on them their worst nightmare.’ Mr Sheppard said the SNP would force Westminster to ‘march to the rhythm of the people of Scotland’. He also praised Labour’s notorious 1983 manifesto, dubbed the ‘longest suicide note in history’, saying it contained ‘a lot of good thinking’. Martin Docherty, SNP candidate for West Dunbartonshire, suggested the party would use power to take revenge for the way Scotland has been ‘treated’ by England over centuries. John Nicolson, the party’s candidate in East Dunbartonshire, confirmed the SNP would use its influence to force Labour to scrap the replacement of Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent. And Chris Law, SNP candidate for Dundee West, said: ‘My neighbour’s house was burned down by the Suffragettes, so we know how to take radical action. I’m not suggesting that you send me to London… we’ve been there before with Guy Fawkes. 'But if I’m elected to Westminster I’m going to make sure there’s fire in my belly, a loud voice and a strong fight to hold their feet to the fire for a roasting.’ Conservative vice-chairman Bob Neill said the ‘dangerous’ comments underlined the threat posed by allowing the SNP to share power at Westminster. Mr Neill said: ‘Their demands would never end and we would all pay for their economic chaos. The SNP are promising our “worst nightmare”, weak Ed Miliband at the mercy of Nicola Sturgeon – the only way to stop it and protect the economy is to vote Conservative.’","Scottish First Minister's party is on course for landslide north of border .
Miliband says he won't agree to 'confidence and supply' deal with SNP .
But he refuses to rule out relying on SNP votes to pass key legislation .

"There were scenes of jubilation in the Dutch city of Dordrecht today, as flag-waving locals turned out to welcome King Willem-Alexander and his glamorous wife Maxima today. The visit, which kicked off with a pageant aboard a flotilla of boats on the local canal, was part of Willem-Alexander's 48th birthday celebrations. Koningsdag - or King's Day - is a public holiday in the Netherlands and is traditionally marked with a royal procession either in the capital Amsterdam or in one of the country's major cities. Happy family: The Dutch royals celebrated King Willem-Alexander's birthday in Dordrecht . Warm welcome: The Dutch royal couple were all smiles as they meet well-wishers in the trading city . Today, it was the turn of Dordrecht, a city in the south-west of the country, which was once a major trading port, as well as a military hub. Signs of its martial past were thin on the ground today, however, with the streets filled with a sea of joyful humanity, most of whom cheered and waved as the royals floated past. Taking centre stage was Argentina-born Queen Maxima, who opted for a typically eye-catching ensemble of a raspberry pink coat and hat enlivened with a pair of chunky crystal earrings. Also aboard the royal barge, the Dordtevaar, were the couple's three daughters: Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange, 11, Princess Alexia, nine, and Princess Ariane, eight. Willem-Alexander's brother Prince Constantijn, 45, was also aboard, as was his 48-year-old wife, Princess Laurentien, who opted for a tailored dress in patriotic bright orange. Is that it? Eldest daughter Princess Catharina-Amalia, 11, cuddles up to her mother during the event . Round of applause: The Queen and the princesses join in with a round of applause for Willem-Alexander . Big arrival: The couple and their three daughters travelled through the city by barge . Family affair:  The couple was joined by Prince Constantijn and his wife Laurentien who wore bright orange . Looking good: Maxima looked wonderful in her summery raspberry pink get-up . Matching: The Dutch queen completed her look with a slick of bright pink lipstick and chunky earrings . All smiles: The 43-year-old appeared to be enjoying the occasion and smiled brightly throughout . Echoing their parents and uncle, all three girls smiled and waved at the crowds, most of whom seemed to be enjoying the bright spring sunshine while watching the procession go past. Others used the royal day off to make some extra money, with one enterprising soul setting up a stand that offered selfies with cardboard versions of the Dutch royals for €1 apiece. Koningsdag is a long-standing Dutch tradition that began in 1890 with Queen Wilhelmina who celebrated her birthday on the 31st August. When her daughter Juliana became Queen, the date was moved to the 30th April - a tradition maintained by her daughter Beatrix, even though her real birthday is the 31st January. Since April 2013, when Willem-Alexander took the throne following his mother's abdication, the holiday has taken place his birthday, the 27th April. The celebrations, which kick off the night before with King's Parties, also include vrijmarkts - flea markets - in most towns and mass consumption of a delicious orange pastry called the tompouce. A right royal selfie! A well-wisher snaps a selfie with the Dutch King and Queen . Royal wave: King Willem-Alexander waves at the crowds during a walk through the city with his children . Enjoying the sunshine: Both royals and revellers made the most of the beautiful sunshine . Big hug: Queen Maxima hugs her two youngest daughters, Princesses Ariane and Alexia . Speech! King Willem-Alexander talks to the crowds during his visit to Dordrecht . Enterprising: This little girl decided to add to her pocket money by selling selfies for €1 apiece .

"A cake-making prodigy is set to be the next Mary Berry as she prepares to publish her second cookbook. Amy-Beth Ellice, 17, from Essex started baking at the age of three and landed her first book deal with her recipe collection Amy's Baking Year at just 14. Her second, all about entertaining, is now firmly in the works but the teenager has her sights set even higher - with plans to launch her own baking products and even become a TV chef. Already baking at five years old Amy-Beth (left) is pictured with sister Lara-Jayne, 10 . Amy-Beth started baking at three-years-old and published her first cookbook, Amy's Baking Year, at age 13 . Amy-Beth most recently hosted a cupcake-making class in Harrods, London. Britain's youngest published baker, who counts Pixie Lott and Katherine Jenkins among her fans, delighted a crowd with her recent demonstration. She then signed copies of her debut cookbook in the Toy Kingdom department for thrilled shoppers. Amy-Beth also has a regular column in OK! magazine and continues to supply other publications with tips and recipes. The keen cook, who attends Newhall School in Chelmsford full-time, makes bespoke baked goods to order in her spare time, during summer holidays and half term. But it seems the talented young baker gets it all from her mother Gillian, who taught Amy and her other daughter Lara-Jayne, 22, how to make cakes. Amy gets decorating as she shows onlookers how to perfect cupcakes at a London presentation . The young cook pictured with fans at her Harrods book signing and cupcake masterclass . Amy picked up a particular knack for baking and continued to experiment until she soon took full control of the kitchen and the entertaining. Gillian told MailOline: 'When she was little Amy showed an interest and passion, as I did when I was a child, in cooking and baking. 'She watched me cook all meals and bake birthday cakes for many members of our family from scratch. 'I always preferred to make my own cakes as I knew exactly what was going in them, they tasted nicer and they were (and still are) much appreciated. 'Amy soon wanted to venture out on her own and at aged 12 she asked if she could bake her sister Lara-Jayne's cake for her 17th birthday. 'I had planned a simple chocolate sponge cake but Amy, being more adventurous, single-handedly created a two-tiered cake covered in roll-out fondant icing. 'She then decorated it with heart shaped biscuits on sticks, which later became a recipe in her book (lollipop biscuits). 'She has quite literally surpassed me in the kitchen, a fact that I'm both proud and amazed at. 'It is sometimes hard to get into the kitchen now as Amy is often experimenting with recipes, baking for charity cake sales, or helping preparing for a party or event we are organising.' Her inventive bakes are remarkable for her age. Amy designed and made a pony-themed cake for a teacher at age 12. At age 14 she was commissioned by another teacher to make a three-tiered lace effect wedding cake. She finally baked it in chocolate at age 16 using carrot, pineapple and lemon flavours. A mini oven at Christmas could certainly have helped ignite Amy's passion for cake making . When she was little Amy showed an interest and passion in cooking and baking . Amy launched a cupcake and cake business at age 13 with the help of her mother, as they both thought they could make better cakes than what was already out there. The teenager said: 'I made cupcakes for regular clients as well as celebrity functions and after parties and it grew from there. 'After having seven of my recipes published in a national newspaper weekend supplements, I approached a few publishers with a mock-up of the ideas I had for my book and got the book deal at age 14.' Her book, Amy's Baking Year, features recipes themed around the four seasons and occasions such as for Mother's Day, Easter, Halloween and Christmas. Amy launched a cupcake and cake business at age 13 with the help of her mother Gillian, as they both thought they could make better cakes than what was already out there . This catapulted Amy into the limelight of the baking world and opened up multiple doors for her . From cute cupcakes, French macarons, cookies, tarts and classic sponge cakes, to sticky puddings, jams and gingerbread - plus Amy's highly sought after 'perfect cupcake' recipe - there is an indulgent treat to suit every occasion. With a focus on family, the recipes are designed for both seasoned bakers and young enthusiasts. Amy's Baking Year features Amy's selected easy-to-follow recipes themed around the four seasons . The beautifully illustrated book also features tips on the perfect decoration and setting for each bake. She says: 'I have been brought up cooking and baking by my mum who is also a talented home cook and baker, as were her parents who both worked in catering.' A few of the recipes in the book such as my Grandad's Coconut Ice, and Aunty Lynn's Fudge have been passed down to Amy from members of her family. She continues: 'While I was at home experimenting with recipes my friends were spending their time on social media. 'It was something that I was passionate about so really enjoyed spending my time focusing on it. 'I think it's important that we return to traditional values and that what I try to get across through my cooking. 'The art of cooking and eating healthily is important to me, so I'm very conscious of the ingredients I cook with, but I think we're becoming too calorie obsessed. That being said I try not to eat everything I bake.' She is juggling her lucrative cooking career around studying for her A-levels in English literature, art and music. 'The school I attend doesn't offer cookery as an A Level. I hope to go on to train at Le Cordon Bleu in the future after I have finished school.' Amy says she hopes to have her next cookbook themed around entertaining on bookshelves nationwide by 2017.","Amy-Beth Ellice, 17, from Essex started baking at three years old .

"Thousands of people have signed a petition calling for a controversial weight loss advertisement to be pulled, as Katie Hopkins slammed those complaining about the posters as 'chubsters'. The bright yellow advert for Protein World has been put up in a number of London Underground stations and features a model in a bikini with the question: 'Are you beach body ready?'. But the campaign, which promotes the brand's weight loss collection, has attracted the ire of many social media users and body image campaigners, with some of the posters even being defaced. Scroll down for video . More than 45,000 people have signed a petition calling for this controversial Protein World weight loss advertisement featuring a woman in a bikini to be pulled . A change.org petition calling for the removal of the adverts has now attracted more than 45,000 signatures, while critics of the billboard, unhappy at the insinuation that only those who resemble the model, 24-year-old Renee Somerfield, have the appropriate figures for the beach, have started a hashtag #everybodysready. Now Katie Hopkins has waded into the row, dubbing those who have been vandalising posters 'chubsters', and saying they should turn their efforts to exercising instead. Hopkins, who has been outspoken about weight in the past, tweeted: 'Chubsters, quit vandalising Protein World ads and get your a*** running on the road. Feminism isn’t an excuse for being fat. Eat less move more. 'Ads for ‘beach body ready’ vandalised. Society has huge acceptance for being fat - but masses of abuse for being skinny.' 'We are cheer leading chubsters; ""brave"" ""beautiful inside and out"" but we are quick to shame those with self control, eating in moderation.' The former Celebrity Big Brother star, who has made a documentary about her own weight gain and loss, later added: 'Let's get the @ProteinWorld ads at the top of stairs and steep hills. Get the chubsters with their sharpies shifting their chubby a****. Hopkins tweeted: 'Chubsters, quit vandalising Protein World ads and get your a*** running on the road' Katie Hopkins has previously been outspoken on the issue of weight, and wrote on Twitter that 'society has a huge acceptance for being fat - but masses of abuse for being skinny' Hopkins spoke out against those campaigning for the advert to be withdrawn on Twitter . Hopkins later declared that she was going on a run, and encouraged 'angry chubsters' to chase her . 'Off for a run. Angry chubsters - feel free to catch me and tell me about your 'medical issues' @ProteinWorld'. The change.org petition states: 'Protein World is directly targeting individuals, aiming to make them feel physically inferior to the unrealistic body image of the bronzed model, in order to sell their product. 'Perhaps not everyone’s priority is having a ‘beach body’ (by the way, what is that?), and making somebody feel guilty for not prioritising it by questioning their personal choices is a step too far. 'A body’s function is far more intricate and important than looking ‘beach ready’, so in fact it is Protein World who have confused their priorities, if anyone.' The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it has received 216 complaints about the ad, and a spokeswoman said the general nature of the complaints is that the ad is 'offensive, irresponsible and harmful because it promotes an unhealthy body image'. An investigation has not been launched but the ASA said they are 'carefully assessing' the complaints to 'establish if there are grounds for further action'. Online fitness store Protein World, who claim the image has not been doctored using Photoshop, have also been actively engaging in the furore on social media, strongly defending their campaign with some biting responses to aggrieved Twitter users. Richard Staveley, head of marketing at Protein World, said it was 'great' that Hopkins had added her voice to the debate. 'I think much of what is being said and shared online Katie is obviously in agreement,' he said. Hopkins was regularly seen exercising during her time in Celebrity Big Brother . 'It's great to have somebody of such high profile getting involved at all, because it's obviously something that we want to be discussed. 'We want to encourage discussion on this. Ultimately we want to encourage a healthier, fitter nation. We want to encourage everybody to be the very best version of themselves. 'It has been quite odd how many people we've found who are far quicker to fit shame than fat shame. 'And you know if that makes us bad then so be it, and if Katie Hopkins is in agreement with us then we're delighted,' he said. Last week Hopkins was blasted by the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights after she likened migrants to cockroaches. A change.org petition calling for the removal of the adverts has now attracted more than 43,000 signatures, while critics of the billboard have started a hashtag #everybodysready . Many of the posters have been doctored, including this version which had been put up on  a train . Another campaigner has their say on one of the Protein World posters . Jordanian Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said the reality television star had used language in her Sun column similar to that used by newspapers and radio stations in Rwanda before the 1994 genocide which led to hundreds of thousands of people being slaughtered. Mr Staveley said Protein World has no official relationship with Hopkins, adding: 'We don't endorse any of her other comments or views necessarily.' The company's Twitter account retweeted Hopkins but Mr Staveley said a retweet does not mean endorsement, adding that it was 'great' to have someone with such a 'strong following' wade in to the debate. He said there is 'no concern' on behalf of the company regarding the petition. Katie Hopkins has described those campaigning against the controversial Protein World 'Beach Ready' adverts as 'chubsters' 'We won't be removing the ad. I mean, there's more than two and a half million people use the London Underground every day and, like I say, sales have considerably jumped, so regardless of that 40,000 I think I can comfortably say that we've had ... it's been better for us, there's been far more positive reaction than negative,' he said. Mr Staveley said they 'always welcome constructive criticism"" but said there were ""some serial perpetual complainers out there'. He said some of the criticism has demonstrated 'irrational extremist behaviour', such as the 'vandalising' of adverts. Mr Staveley said Protein World is 'not a faceless corporation that's just going to sit silently', adding: 'We're a brand with a personality and that means there will be certain level of engagement across our social media channels which might take some people by surprise.' He said he fully endorsed that engagement, adding: 'That's part of our strategy.' Protein World’s Twitter account has tweeted that it is 'Here to motivate, not commiserate', and used the hashtag #getagrip. 'We are a nation of sympathisers for fatties,' a spokesperson for Protein World tweeted to one user after she signed the change.org petition calling for the removal of the advert. 'Why make your insecurities our problem?' Mr Staveley said if significant 'vitriol' is directed towards Protein World, they are not going to 'sit back and ignore it'. The model at the centre of the controversy has also responded to the 'contradictor' drama, citing the irony of people getting angry about body shaming, whilst body shaming her. 'I think nearly every ad campaign you have ever seen is open to interpretation. But saying the ad is body shaming by body shaming the image is very contradictory. Two wrongs don't make a right,' she told the Huffington Post. Australian Ms Somerfield, who is a strict vegan, said: 'I am a real person behind the image. I work very hard and live a healthy and active lifestyle which is why Protein World chose me for their campaign. I couldn't work every day as a full time model by starving myself, dieting or not looking after my body. Nourish your body, be kind to it and it will love you right back, no matter your size. 'I agree that ALL bodies are 'beach body ready'. Skinny, curvy, muscular, petite, tall, short, young and old. Confidence is beautiful no matter what size you are.... Your reflection doesn't define your worth.' According to its website, Protein World is 'leading the protein revolution with a new and innovative range of pure, GMO-free supplements to help you become healthier, leaner, fitter and stronger'. It says their weight-loss supplements will 'help raise your metabolism and burn fat fast'.","Yellow Protein World advert has the message 'Are you beach body ready?'

"Tents crushed by snow, belongings strewn across the mountainside and a desperate scramble to find any injured victims: this is the chaotic scene after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake sparked an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing 18 people. Before and after images show how the wave of snow, ice and rock flattened the usually serene 18,000-foot-altitude base camp on Saturday. The avalanche started on Mount Kumori, a 23,000-foot-high mountain just a few miles from Everest, and gathered strength as it tore across the world's highest peak. Half an hour after the initial quake, another magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit, followed by smaller aftershocks across the region. Eighteen people died in the avalanche, including four Americans, and 61 were injured, according to Nepal's mountaineering department. Scroll down for videos . Covered: An image, left, shows Everest Base Camp as it usually looks in April compared to how the same place looked following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake on Saturday. Survivors have recalled how they felt themselves being dragged by the wind and snow and emerged to find the camp destroyed . Before the storm: The snow-covered scenes are in start contrast to how the base camp (seen in 2013) usually looks at this time of year . Flattened: But on Saturday, an avalanche pummeled the campers at the 18,000-foot-altitude base camp, leaving it covered with snow . American Google executive Dan Fredinburg, 33, was the first confirmed fatality on the mountain. New Jersey-born Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, was also killed by the avalanche where she worked as a medic for Madison Mountaineering. A third American, Tom Taplin, 61, who owned TET Films & Photography, was making a documentary when the earthquake hit, NBC News reported. His wife Corey Fryer told the station he died 'doing what he loved'. On Sunday the first survivors were flown off Everest by aid helicopters and began sharing their incredible stories of survival. Bhim Bahudar Khatri, a cook for a climbing team, said: 'I was cooking for my team in the meal tent when the earthquake hit. We all rushed out to the open and the next moment a huge wall of snow just piled on me. 'I managed to dig out of what could easily have been my grave. I wiggled and used my hands as claws to dig as much as I could. I was suffocating, I could not breathe. But I knew I had to survive. 'I dug a few more feet until I was out of the snow and could breathe. I looked around and saw the tents all torn, crushed and many people injured. I had lived, but lost many of my friends.' An Everest guide, Pemba Sherpa, 43, added: 'I was resting in my tent when the earthquake hit. I heard a big noise and the next thing I know I was swept away by the snow. I must have been swept almost 200 meters. I lost consciousness. Wreckage: People look over the scene on Saturday after the earthquake triggered the avalanche that flattened parts of the base camp . Deadly: An image from Sunday shows a tent completely flattened by the avalanche, which left 18 people dead on Saturday . Carried to safety: Rescuers use a makeshift stretcher to carry an injured person after the massive avalanche on Saturday . Changed landscape: Another photograph shows the base camp following the huge avalanche on Saturday . Fight for survival: One survivor recalled 'a huge wall of snow' falling on him and how he had to claw his way out to survival . Recovery: A group is seen carrying an injured climber in their sleeping bag; more than 60 people were injured in the incident . Mountaineering instructor Chris Harling, 41, from Keswick, Cumbria, has spoken of the terrifying moment he felt the ground 'turn to jelly under his feet' after the earthquake hit Mount Everest . 'When I regained consciousness, I was in a tent surrounded by foreigners. I did not know what happened or where I was.' He said the toll on Everest was sure to rise: 'There are still many people who are still missing on the mountain. There were several tents buried by the snow, several blown away.' Michael Churton, a filmmaker from New York, was with four other colleagues at the base camp when the earthquake hit, and he said that it took about 45 seconds for the avalanche to finish. 'I told the group to get down,' he said. 'It was about 4,000 feet of snow just coming and there was nowhere to run.' After curling up into a fetal position, he was thrown into a rock, which left him with cuts to his face and a black eye - but he was otherwise uninjured. Mountaineering instructor Chris Harling, 41, from Keswick, Cumbria, has spoken of the terrifying moment he felt the ground 'turn to jelly under his feet' after the earthquake hit Mount Everest. Speaking from his sleeping bag at base camp on the north side of the mountain, the experienced climber said his group took cover after rocks the size of cars came crashing down around them. 'At first we could feel the trembling under the tent, but it was eerie as there was no noise, it was silent. Then it felt like we were shaking on a huge plate of jelly,' he said. 'It was so strange feeling the ground turn to jelly under our feet and we thought the mountain would start crashing down on us.' The instructor from Adventure Peaks, who was leading a group of eight clients on their first trip up the mountain, said the area was badly hit by rock falls, but they all escaped injury. Killed: Three Americans died on the mountain: Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, (left), who was working as a medic at the time, Google exec Dan Fredinburg, 33, (center with his ex-girlfriend, actress Sophia Bush) and documentary filmmaker Tom Taplin, 61 (right) Heading out: Rescuers carry a sherpa injured by the avalanche. The quake is believed to have killed more than 4,000 people . Heading home: A rescue helicopter prepares to land on Sunday and the first survivors were carried off the mountainside . 'Sure enough, an area of steep cliffs did break off sending car sized boulders hurtling down only a few hundred metres from our tents. We are still feeling aftershocks hours later. 'We were very lucky as no one in our group has been injured, but one climber was struck by a boulder.' He said their main priority was now working out how to leave base camp and make their way home, as the road to Kathmandu has been obliterated by the quake. 'We are trapped and have nowhere to go, we can't get back to Kathmandu, the road has been completely destroyed and there is absolutely no way to get through.' Climber Garrett Madison, who runs Seattle-based firm Madison Mountaineering, described how he was leading his group up the mountain when he heard the terrifying sound of avalanches. 'We heard an awful noise and heard avalanches coming down either side of the valley,' he said. 'We thought we were going to get wiped out but we were only dusted by a snow cloud. We proceeded up to Camp Two and contacted Base Camp where we heard of the awful destruction.' On Monday, it emerged that the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 4,400 people, with more than 8,000 injured. The toll is expected to rise as assessments are made in vulnerable mountain villages that have been inaccessible since the quake. Nepalese officials have speculated that the number of casualties could reach as high as 10,000.","Photographs taken after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake sparked an avalanche on Mount Everest on Saturday show the campsite buried beneath snow and belongings strewn across the mountain .

"Oil from a Russian  trawler which was towed out to  sea to sink after catching fire in port is washing up on the beaches of Gran Canaria and  threatening  tourist spots across the Canary Islands. The Russian vessel Oleg Naydenov was carrying 1,400 metric tons of viscous fuel oil, when it caught fire in Las Palmas port on April 11. It was towed out to sea as a precaution and sank some 15 miles south of the island three days later. Clean up operation: Volunteers clear oil from the sunken Russian Trawler Naydenov on Los Seco beach, Gran Canaria . Spill: The  Oleg Naydenov was carrying 1,400 tonnes of fuel oil when it caught fire in Las Palmas port before being  towed it out to sea where it sank . Threat: An aerial picture shows part of the three mile long oil slick which is also threatening the Canary Islands of Tenerife and La Gomera . The Spanish government activated an environmental emergency alert and said one beach has been cleared of oil and clean-up operations were ongoing on three other beaches near the tourist town of Maspalomas. The government activated a level 2 alert after analyzing ocean current data from Spain's Oceanographic Institute, saying the slick that reached coastlines earlier in the week could affect vulnerable land. Level 2 is the second highest alert level. Environmental group Greenpeace  criticised the decision to tow the  vessel out to sea and has called on the Spanish government to dedicate more resources to the clean-up operation.

Measures: The government activated a level two alert after analyzing ocean current data from Spain's Oceanographic Institute . A three mile slick of oil floating on the surface was photographed from the air last week and it is feared ocean currents could carry it onto the islands of Tenerife and La Gomera. Authorities estimated last week that the ship was currently leaking between five and 10 litres of fuel into the sea per hour. Development Ministry spokesman Julio Gomez said on Sunday that slicks were being monitored; a day after the government activated an alert, saying oil could damage the islands' vulnerable coasts. Greenpeace is calling on the Spanish government to dedicate more resources to the clean-up operation . Greenpeace released this picture of a dolphin with oil on its fin and have demanded Spanish authorities do more to control the spread of the oil which could hit Tenerife and La Gomera .

An unmanned remote-controlled submarine sent down 2,400 meters (7,900 feet) to survey the wreck . Greenpeace posted photographs of a dolphin partially coated in oil, while Spanish state television TVE broadcast images of workers cleaning a rocky beach that was stained black with oil. Red Cross spokesman Jose Antonio Rodriguez told The Associated Press that Veneguera beach on Gran Canaria island, a top European vacation spot, had been cleaned. An unmanned remote-controlled submarine sent down 2,400 meters (7,900 feet) to survey the wreck of the Russian trawler was inspecting to see if three holes in its hull could be blocked.","The Russian vessel caught fire in port and was towed out to sea to sink .

"A couple who suffered five devastating miscarriages and lost their six-month-old son because he was born prematurely finally have the family they dreamed of after his sister acted as a surrogate. Pritesh, 36 and Mansi Gandhi, 35, started trying for a baby ten years ago but repeatedly lost the baby due to a medical condition. Mansi, from Feltham, London, did manage to become pregnant and gave birth in 2007 but Khushi was so premature he died after a six-month fight for life. However, Pritesh's sister Hiral Shah, 32, stepped in and offered to carry the couple's baby - and after IVF treatment, gave birth to Krish three weeks ago after a 20-minute labour. Mansi did manage to eventually become pregnant and gave birth in 2007 but the boy, Khushi, was so premature he died after a six-month fight for life, so they Krish was a miracle for them . Pritesh and Manis, a supermarket worker, met through family friends in 2001 and the smitten pair got married a year later, and began trying for a baby after three years. Manis fell pregnant in 2007, but Khushi was born with brain haemorrhages and died aged six months in May 2007 and after spending most of his short life in hospital. Doctors investigated and Mansi was diagnosed with cervical insufficiency - premature dilation of the cervix due to the weight of a growing baby. The couple continued to attempt to have a baby, but suffered miscarriages at 18 weeks in 2008, 14 weeks in 2009, 18 weeks in 2010. Doctors put stitches in Mansi's cervix in a bid to keep it closed, but tragically they also lost a further two babies in the early weeks of pregnancy in 2012 and 2013. Mansi said: 'I gave up on any hopes of having a child of my own after losing six babies. 'It's heartbreaking to lose even one baby whereas in my case I lost six babies and that made me feel awful about myself. 'I started hating myself and always thought why can't I have a baby when everyone around me is blessed with one.' Pritesh and Mansi Gandhi finally welcomed a baby boy, Krish, after losing six babies, after Pritesh's sister Hiral acted as a surrogate. L-R Pritesh, Mansi, baby Krish, Hiral, husband Amish and their son Ronav . Pritesh added: 'It was so hard and very traumatic. 'I couldn't put Mansi through any more pain and I was worried that if we tried for any longer Mansi would get depressed. 'I didn't want anything to happen to her so we gave up. 'We thought ""it's OK, we are not meant to have children, let us just assume that God hasn't written a child into our fate.""' The heartbroken pair had given up hope of ever having a family when Hiral offered to carry their baby - despite having a six-month-old son of her own. They called a family meeting and promised to do all they could to support Hiral, who already had a son Ronav, now one, with husband Amish, 33, an engineer. Hiral underwent IVF at CRM CARE Fertility in London, costing £10,000, and after her brother and sister-in-law produced two embryos, one was implanted last summer and she fell pregnant. Little Krish was born at West Middlesex University Hospital on March 27 - with Pritesh and Mansi waiting outside the room during the quick 20 minute labour. Pritesh and Mansi now have the family they always dreamed of and said they will be 'forever in debt' to Pritesh's sister. Operations manager Pritesh said: 'My sister and I were always close but this has made all the difference. Hiral (left, pictured while pregnant) underwent IVF and gave birth to Krish (right) three weeks ago . 'She is an extra special aunty and for the rest of my life I will be in debt to my sister. 'She had a baby of her own at the time but she still wanted to help me and my family. 'What we went through was so traumatic, but now we finally have a happy family.' Accounts assistant Hiral added that although it had been an emotional experience she had been eager to help her struggling brother. 'I witnessed all the losses which my brother and his wife suffered over the years. 'The handing over of baby Krish was obviously quite emotional moment for all of us but seeing my brother and his wife very happy made that process a bit easier too. 'I feel ever so happy when I see my brother playing with his little one and it makes me ever so happy to know that I am the reason for his happiness.' Pritesh says that his sister's selfless act has bought much joy to their family. 'Mansi was scared and we were so excited, first of all to find out the sex of the baby, and most importantly to hold him for the first time,' said Pritesh. 'I have to be honest I cried. Everyone was so happy. Hiral (pictured here with husband Amish) says that handing over Krish to Pritesh and Mansi  was emotional but she was glad to see her brother happy . 'We held him first. Obviously my sister found it a little bit difficult, which we were expecting, but she knew she was making us so happy and that made her happy.' Overjoyed Mansi said she will let Krish know about his aunt's gift as soon as he is old enough. She said: 'I am sure that Krish will always have a special place for Hiral in his heart. 'I am so overjoyed and I can't believe that I am holding a baby of my own. 'It's a miracle baby and Hiral is a God-send for us. 'I can't express in words how grateful I am to Hiral and her family and I would like to thank Hira's family to stand by Hiral's decision. 'It's because of such kind-hearted people like Hiral the world is a beautiful place to live.' Hiral added: 'My brother has always gone an extra mile whenever I have needed his help and I thought to myself that now it was my turn to try and help him by giving him this amazing gift of his life. 'I was aware that it was a quite a big commitment but my keen desire to help my brother made me overcome that issue. 'Baby Krish means the world to my brother.' Pritesh wants to encourage more infertile couples to use surrogacy in the UK rather than abroad, which can result in immigration and custody battles.","Pritesh and Mansi Gandhi had been trying for a baby for ten years .

"It is a saddening site of great human and cultural loss following Nepal's devastating earthquake that has killed at least 4,000 people. But dozens of people have been clambering around the debris of the famed Dharahara Tower in Kathmandu to take selfies in front of the wreckage. They have been taking pictures amongst the rubble of the historic nine-storey structure, which has been reduced to an enormous pile of red brick dust. Scroll down for video . 'This is not right': A man takes a selfie at the historic Dharahara Tower that was damaged in Saturday's earthquake in Kathmandu, Nepal . Criticism: One rescuer in Nepal said those who were taking photographs of themselves and friends were not 'understanding the tragedy' But one rescuer in the Nepalese capital said those who were taking photographs of themselves and friends were not 'understanding the tragedy'. It is unclear how many people were killed in the tower in the quake-hit city, but it was believed to have been filled with tourists. Pawan Thapa, 21, a business student who arrived from the suburbs to help with the recovery effort, was dismayed by the scene. He said: 'This is earthquake tourism. This is not right. They are more interested in clicking their selfies than understanding that it is a tragedy.' Destroyed: It is unclear how many people were killed in the tower in the quake-hit city, but it was believed to have been filled with tourists . Taking a picture: The tower has been photographed far more than other buildings destroyed by the natural disaster, which struck on Saturday . But most of those taking pictures were said to be local residents capturing the devastation of their community, rather than tourists. The tower built by Nepal's royal rulers in the 1800s was one of the country's most treasured monuments. It has been photographed far more than other buildings destroyed by the natural disaster, which struck just before midday on Saturday. The 7.8-magnitude quake sent tremors through the Kathmandu Valley and set in motion an avalanche which swept the face of Mount Everest.

Before and after: The tower built by Nepal's royal rulers in the 1800s was one of the country's most treasured monuments . As well as the huge death toll, thousands more people were injured - and it was the worst such disaster to hit Nepal since 1934 when 8,500 died. The United Nations said today that it was releasing £10million from its central emergency response fund to help the earthquake victims. The World Food Programme is sending food and aid supplies to Nepal, saying that logistics and emergency response teams are already working there. And a Save the Children relief worker said waterborne and infectious diseases are a risk because people are living outdoors in crowded situations.","Dozens of people clambering around debris of Dharahara Tower in Kathmandu to take selfies in front of wreckage .

"George Osborne has revealed he is secretly addicted to hit BBC series Poldark – and confessed to a crush on its female lead character Demelza. The Chancellor claimed the 'one hour' a week he had allowed himself off each week during the election campaign was to watch the programme, starring Aidan Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson. He vowed to maintain tax relief on big TV productions which have encouraged the makers of Poldark and other series to choose the UK. Scroll down for video . Mr Osborne admitted that he was secretly addicted to hit BBC series Poldark, starring Aidan Turner . The Chancellor said the television show was a 'fantastic advert for Britain' and particularly Cornwall . 'I haven't seen the original series from the 70s, so it's all new. It's a fantastic advert for Britain and British talent – and also for Cornwall,' the Chancellor told the Daily Mail. 'I am sure many visitors will flock to Cornwall from around the world when they see these wonderful scenes of Poldark riding along the cliffs. 'It has been the one hour off during the whole of this campaign. I keep my 9pm on a Sunday clear for that. It's fantastic. It's the very best of British television.' Asked whether he was was on 'team Demelza' or 'team Elizabeth', the Chancellor confessed: 'I'm bit of a Demelza fan, it has to be said.' Mr Osborne confessed to a crush on its female lead character Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson . Mr Osborne said he was 'delighted' that the series had been shot in Britain. 'Frankly, under the tax regime I inherited a production like this would have gone somewhere else in Europe, like Ireland or on the Continent,' he said. 'I said I wanted the best TV done in this country. It's about creating jobs. I think this series is going to run and run.' It is understood that tax credits introduced by the Treasury to encourage programme-makers to choose the UK has been worth more than £2 million to Mammoth Screen, the production company behind Poldark. Sources close to the company say that without the incentive, it would have been filmed in Ireland. Instead, it is going back to Cornwall for a second series. Poldark has attracted as many as seven million viewers, helping BBC1 to its highest ratings share for the first quarter of the year in a decade.","Chancellor said show was a 'fantastic advert for Britain and British talent'

"Friends of murdered Indiana University student Hannah Wilson have said she was last seen at the same bar where Lauren Spierer partied before she vanished in 2011. Wilson's body was found in rural Brown County, about 10 miles from the campus, on Friday morning after a night out. Daniel Messel, 49, was arrested hours later and has been charged in her death. Circumstances of her disappearance are 'eerily similar' to the case of 20-year-old Spierer, police told Fox59, and they will be looking into the case again. Spierer vanished after a night out at Kilroy's Sports Bar in Bloomington with a group of friends nearly four years ago. Her body has never been found and no criminal charges have ever been filed. 'Eerily similar': Student Hannah Wilson, left, was found murdered hours after leaving a bar in Bloomington, Indiana last week - nearly four years after Lauren Spierer, right, vanished after leaving the same bar . On Monday, Wilson's friends said she had been partying in downtown Bloomington  and they were also going to go to Kilroy's Sports Bar, but deemed that she was too drunk to join them there. The group put Wilson into a taxi alone around 1am on Friday and gave the driver her address. Her body was found near Lake Lemon at around 8.30am. She died from blunt force trauma to the head, according to the county coroner, and preliminary results of an autopsy show she was struck three or four times in the back of the head with an object. Her only other injuries were superficial abrasions and bruises that the coroner said were protective, rather than defensive, wounds. 'Like trying to prevent her head from being hit,' he told The Herald-Times. Wilson was found fully clothed and there was no sign of sexual assault, police told Sky News. Toxicology reports for the woman will not be available for ten to 14 days. Police said they traced a cellphone found near Wilson's feet to Daniel Messel and after they arrested him, investigators found blood in his vehicle, according to a probable cause affidavit. Arrested: Daniel Messel, 49, has been arrested on suspicion of her murder. A cellphone that police traced back to Messel was found at Wilson's feet and investigators allegedly found blood inside his vehicle . Last seen: Her friends went to this bar in Bloomington but, thinking that Wilson was too drunk, put her in a taxi to go home. Spierer also spent time at the same bar before she vanished in 2011 . Messel's stepfather, Gerald Messel, told Fox59 that the man spoke of meeting a girl called 'Hannah' at bars near the university campus ahead of her death. Gerald Messel, who lives with his stepson, said he was surprised when the man failed to come home on Thursday evening and he failed to go to work the next day. When Daniel Messel arrived back home, he was arrested by police, he said. Troopers have confiscated his computer, phone and vehicle. This is also not Messel's first run in with the police, according the the Indiana Daily Student. He was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and endangering persons in 1995. A year later, he was sentenced to eight years in prison for battery by means of a deadly weapon and battery resulting in serious bodily injury. The president of the Panhellenic Association at Indiana University has organized a fund will go towards providing one full year of room and board for Wilson's sister (above Wilson pictured with her father) Wilson, originally from Fishers, Indiana, was a senior studying psychology at the university. Friends held multiple vigils for the beloved student over the weekend. In one of the vigils, around 1,500 students comforted each other as they assembled on Saturday evening at the campus' Alumni Hall. Balloons were released from the building's solarium by her Gamma Phi Beta sorority sisters. Wilson's mother and sister were present at the memorial and were shielded by family and friends who shared fond memories of her, according to the Indy Star. Indiana University spokesman Mark Land said 'the entire IU Bloomington community mourns the tragic death of Hannah Wilson.' 'Our deepest sympathies go out to Hannah's family and friends during this unspeakably sad time,' he said in a statement. 'She was the kind of girl who made everybody feel special,' Maggie Hadley, one of Wilson's former Indiana Elite teammates told The Indianapolis Star.      H . Heartbroken: Thousands of students assembled on Saturday evening at Indiana University's Alumni Hall for an emotional vigil to remember the beloved 22-year-old student . Sadness: Students comfort each other at the Saturday evening vigil, a day after Hannah's body was found . The president of the Panhellenic Association at Indiana University, Margaret Hensley, has also organized a You Caring fund following the news of Wilson's death. The fund will go towards providing one full year of room and board for Wilson's sister. So far, the fund has collected $5,025 in donations. Hensley wrote: 'We have suffered a tragic loss within our community this past weekend, with the horrifying death of Hannah Wilson. Hannah was a beloved Gamma Phi Beta, psychology major, and bright personality. 'Her younger sister, Haley, is planning on attending Indiana University next year. We as a community want to welcome her with open arms, and feel that creating this college fund for her would be the best method. '24,000 dollars would pay for one full year of room and board for Haley. We hope this could aid the Wilson family in this difficult transition and allow Haley to feel welcome into our Bloomington community.'","Police said the circumstances of the disappearances of Hannah Wilson and Lauren Spierer are 'eerily similar'

"A 49-year-old gunman who was holed up in a vintage blue bus has been shot dead following a seven-hour standoff with SWAT officers that involved heavy gunfire, tear gas and the use of an armored car. Mark Hawkins reportedly barricaded himself inside the Greyhound-style bus in the parking lot of a Walmart in Salem, Oregon, after he was approached by police, who believed him to be wanted. Seconds later, Hawkins, who was being hunted in Lane County for failing to appear on a charge of delivery of a controlled substance, allegedly fired his weapon from the front of the large vehicle. The bullet struck a police dog named Baco in the head, prompting an exchange of gunfire between officers and Hawkins. Numerous law enforcement agencies in the area then rushed to the scene.

Shot dead: The suspect (left and right), who was wanted in Lane County for failing to appear on a charge of delivery of a controlled substance, had barricaded himself in the vehicle after he was approached by police . In the hours after the first shot, which occurred shortly before noon on Friday, SWAT officers and police fired more than a dozen rounds of tear gas at the bus in Turner Road - but to no avail. They locked down all shops in the area, including the Walmart, as they attempted to force Hawkins out of the vehicle. They finally decided to ram an armored car into the blue bus, according to KOIN.com. In incredible scenes, SWAT offers drove the car into the bus, punching holes in the larger vehicle. But the suspect apparently still refused to comply with officers and 'continued to brandish a handgun'. At around 6.30pm, police shot at the suspect multiple times. He was hit and wounded by nine bullets, causing him to slide out of the bus. He was then taken to a nearby hospital, where he later died. '[Hawkins] has since died of his injuries,' the Salem Police Department said  on Friday night. It is not yet known whether the bus belonged to Hawkins - and if not, how he managed to get into the vehicle.

"The majority of heatwaves and almost a fifth of extreme rain storms can be blamed on human activity, a new study has warned. Researchers say that three quarters of extreme hot weather and 18 per cent of heavy precipitation is being driven by global warming that has occurred due to man-made emissions. They warn that as climate change pushes global temperatures higher over the coming decades, humans will become responsible for 40 per cent of extreme rainfall events. Researchers say 75% of extreme hot weather and 18% of heavy precipitation is being driven by global warming as a result of man-made emissions. They warn that as climate change pushes global temperatures higher, humans will be responsible for 40% of extreme rainfall events (floods in Somerset in 2014 are shown) The scientists claim it is the rarest and most destructive events that seem to be the most responsive to human influence. Dr Erich Fischer, from the institute for atmospheric and climate science at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich who led the study, said: 'Climate change includes not only changes in mean climate but also in weather extremes. Global temperatures were the highest since records began in 1880, according to scientists. Temperatures across the world averaged 0.8°C (1.4°F) above 20th century averages - making 2014 the warmest year in records dating back 134 years. The Met Office has already announced that 2014 was the hottest year for the UK in records dating back to 1910. Scientists have also warned that 2015 could be warmer still. Earlier this month they revealed that the Earth experienced its hottest month of March since record-keeping began in 1880. The first three months of 2015 have all set new high temperature marks. Last month's average temperature soared to 56.4°F (13.6°C), which is 1.5°F (0.85°C) above the average for the 20th century. Also of concern was the finding that Arctic sea ice was the lowest on record for March. Much of the most abnormal heat has been in the Pacific Ocean and places near it. Seven western U.S. states set records for their hottest first three months of the year, while New York and Vermont set records for the coldest start of a year. Asia, Europe, Africa and Australia have also all been warmer than normal. Blunden blames the record heat on a combination of El Niño, a blob of record hot water in the Northeast Pacific Ocean and human-caused climate change. 'With every degree of warming it is the rarest and the most extreme events and thereby the ones with typically the highest socio-economic impacts for which the largest fraction is due to human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. 'We show that at the present-day warming of 0.85°C about 18 per cent of the moderate daily precipitation extremes over land are attributable to the observed temperature increase since pre-industrial times, which in turn primarily results from human influence. 'For 2°C of warming the fraction of precipitation extremes attributable to human influence rises to about 40 per cent. 'Likewise, today about 75 per cent of the moderate daily hot extremes over land are attributable to warming.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Nature Climate Change, examined the probability that heatwaves and heavy rainfall events could be attributed to humans using 25 climate models. The models examined the weather between 1901 and 2005 using historical simulations. They analysed daily temperatures and daily rainfall totals from climate models and looked for events that would be expected to occur once in 1,000 days in an unperturbed climate - referred to as moderate daily extremes. They then used the models to look at predictions of extreme weather between 2006 and 2100 under an emissions scenario that is expected to lead to 2°C of warming around the world. While attributing individual extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods and heatwaves to climate change is notoriously difficult, climate scientists have predicted they will become more common as the world warms. Dr Fischer and his colleague Professor Reto Knutti, also based at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, said taking a more global perspective made it easier to examine the role that human activity was having on such events. They say their research demonstrated a strong signal for human influence in the extreme weather that is having impacts around the world today. They found that the longer the period of the event - such as a heatwave, the greater the fraction is attributable to global warming. The graphic above shows where the change in the probability of heavy precipitation and heatwaves compared to the pre-industrial period. If global temperatures increase as predicted, as a result of climate change, this becomes more pronounced, explained the researchers . California is in the grip of its worst drought on record, causing lake beds to dry up (as above). Around three quarters of heatwaves can now be attributed to human activity and it is likely to worsen as the climate warms . Dr Fischer said: 'A warmer and moister atmosphere does clearly favour more frequent hot and wet extremes.' Professor Peter Stott, a scientist at the Met Office's Hadley Centre in the UK, pointed to the extreme weather that has happened in the past year - one of the warmest on record. He said Bangladesh was hit by flooding in 2014, Australia suffered heatwaves and Kenya was battered by downpours. California, for example, is in the grip of one of the most severe droughts on record. He added that human-caused climate change had 'loaded the dice' in favour of heatwaves like the one that hit Europe in 2003 and the flooding that hit the UK in autumn 2000. The models examined weather between 1901 and 2005 using historical simulations. They analysed daily temperatures and daily rainfall totals from climate models and looked for events that would be expected to occur once in 1,000 days in an unperturbed climate. Extreme rainfall is pictured in London . Writing in the journal, Professor Stott said: 'As each year goes by, evidence continues to accumulate that our climate is changing and that human influence plays a dominant role in observed warming. 'The prevalence of extremely hot temperatures is expected to increase with warming and more moisture in the atmosphere leads to a tendency towards more extreme rainfall events, changes that have been detected in the observational record. 'But what has been lacking up to now is a robust calculation of how much more likely extreme temperatures and rainfall have become worldwide. 'The idea that in a two-degree world almost half of heavy rainfall events would not have occurred were it not for climate change is a sobering thought for policymakers seeking to mitigate and adapt to climate change.'","Scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich modelled the probability of extreme weather events being caused by human activity .

According to the National Weather Service, there were also unconfirmed reports of shingles being blown off rooftops in Stephenville. One of the tornados appeared over Rio Vista, Texas and was described as slow-moving and 'extremely dangerous'. When it was first spotted, the tornado was estimated to be about a mile wide. By 10:44pm the tornado had moved to near Covington - just 25 miles south of Fort Worth.

'This is a particularly dangerous situation,' the National Weather service warned at the time. Residents were urged to stay indoors and seek shelter because of flying debris and the possibility of 'complete destruction' when it touched down. Nearly two dozen counties were on tornado watch Sunday night through 11pm, with the storm system expected to die out by Monday. In addition to threatening tornadoes, the storm brought high winds over 70 mph and hail ranging in size from golf balls to baseballs. However, there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries in the aftermath of the storm. Stephenville was also hit with large hail that caused damage to vehicles in the area - including this car with a shattered windshield .

This tornado was spotted in Glen Rose, Texas on Sunday during the severe storm system which was expected to last through the night . Weather.com Senior Meteorologist Nick Wiltgen said rotating thunderstorms called supercells are behind the extreme weather seen in Texas this weekend. 'The warm, unstable air is feeding very strong updrafts, causing rapid thunderstorm development – and the way the winds are aligned is allowing some of these storms to rotate, enhancing their potential for giant hail and possibly tornadoes,' Wiltgen said. While the worst of the storm is supposed to be over on Monday, there is a new concern for more rain and flooding.","Severe storms swept north and central Texas Sunday evening .

"President Barack Obama secretly granted the CIA an exemption relaxing restrictions on drone strikes in Pakistan after enacting more stringent rules in 2013 to reduce the risk of civilian casualties, it was revealed today. According to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story Monday citing current and former government officials, Obama gave the spy agency a pass on providing proof that intended targets of drone strikes posed an imminent threat to the US. Had the CIA been subjected to the same stringent rules as other agencies, argues the article, the January drone strike that killed two hostages, one of them an American, could have been postponed or even prevented entirely. Innocent victims: Al Qaeda hostages Dr Warren Weinstein (left), a 73-year-old economic adviser from the US, and 39-year-old Italian aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto (right) were killed in a botched drone strike in January, which US officials say could have been postponed had it not been for a relaxed drone policy . President Obama, seen here April 23 addressing the death of the two captives, reportedly has granted CIA a waiver exempting the agency from providing proof of imminent threat to the US ahead of planned drone strikes . Without Obama's waiver, CIA operatives would have been forced to gather additional information and surveillance data on the al Qaeda-linked militants targeted in the January 15 strike, which may have delayed it, possibly sparing the lives of Dr Warren Weinstein, a 73-year-old economic adviser from the US, and 39-year-old Italian aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto. The CIA was seeking to destroy an al Qaeda compound in Pakistan when the two captives were killed, along with Ahmed Faruq, an American described as a leader of Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent. Al-Qaeda's English-language spokesman, a California rocker-turned jihadist, Adam Gadahn, died in a separate strike. Lo Porto disappeared in January 2012 in Pakistan, just a few days into his second stint in the country. A native of Sicily, Lo Porto previously worked in Croatia, the Central African Republic and Haiti. Weinstein was snatched after gunmen tricked their way into his home in Lahore on August 13, 2011 shortly before he was due to return home after seven years working in Pakistan. He later appeared in a video in which, under apparent coercion, he asked the United States to free Al-Qaeda prisoners. Weinstein's widow said in a statement that ‘we are devastated by this news and the knowledge that my husband will never safely return home.’ President Obama last week publicly apologized for the hostage deaths and took 'full responsibility' for all counter terrorism operations. Several investigations into the botched drone strike, including by the CIA and US Congress, are expected to take place in the coming months. Dr Weinstein, pictured with his wife, was abducted after gunmen tricked their way into his home in Lahore on August 13, 2011 shortly before he was due to return home after seven years working in Pakistan . Flowers and ribbons adorn a tree outside the Weinstein familyhouse in Rockville, Maryland April 23. Earlier, President Obama took full responsibility for the counterterror missions and offered his 'grief and condolences' Obama was quick to stress that 'we do believe that the operation did take out dangerous members of Al-Qaeda.' He also noted that January 15 strike was 'fully consistent with the guidelines under which we conduct counterterrorism efforts in the region. 'Since 9/11, our counterterrorism efforts have prevented terrorist attacks and saved innocent lives both here in America, and around the world,' the commander-in-chief said during a press conference Thursday. CIA drone operations are broadly divided into two distinct categories: 'signature strikes' and 'kill list' strikes, according to the Journal. The agency would go after specific targets if they are present on the kill list, but the president has to personally sign off on each such operation. Signature strikes, however, can be carried out against any suspected enemy combatants and are not subjected to Obama's approval. According to the paper, in 2013 the president endorsed a set of restrictions aimed at eliminating 'signature strikes' altogether in order to reduce the number of civilian deaths, but unnamed officials say many of the rules have yet to be implemented. Despite Obama's defense of his counterterrorism record, congressional leaders rapidly called for more oversight over the drone program., . Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union Sunday, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain said drone strikes against suspected militants on foreign soil should be run by the US military and not the CIA. Pushing for reform: Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain said drone strikes against suspected militants on foreign soil should be run by the US military and not the CIA . ‘I think it was probably preventable, in that there was an obvious breakdown in intelligence. They didn't know that they were there,’ McCain said of the January drone strike. The Republican senator and 2008 failed presidential candidate predicted the incident will renew a debate within the Obama administration on how the drone program is run. However, there still appeared to be strong support in Congress for employing the unmanned drones against enemy targets, which has expanded during the Obama administration. Critics have long complained about civilians being killed in the air strikes. It is an ‘integral part of the conflict and a very essential one,’ McCain told CNN. McCain acknowledged ‘some bias’ on which federal agency should operate the drone program, given that shifting it to the Pentagon from the CIA would put it under his purview as chairman of the Senate committee overseeing the military. Nevertheless, McCain said the Pentagon had the expertise and, ‘I think it should be conducted and oversight and administered by the Department of Defense.’ Warren Weinstein is the seventh American to be killed by drones, the sixth who was hit inadvertently. In December American Luke Somers and South African Pierre Korkie were both killed when US Special Forces attempted to rescue them in Yemen. Obama said he ordered the raid because the 33-year-old Somers was believed to be in 'imminent danger.' The president condemned Somers' killing as a 'barbaric murder.' In 2013, Obama defended America's controversial drone attacks as legal, effective and a necessary linchpin in an evolving U.S. counterterrorism policy, saying, 'Simply put, these strikes save lives.' But also acknowledged the targeted strikes are no 'cure-all' and said he is haunted by the civilians unintentionally killed. Since taking office, Obama's counterterrorism strategy has increasingly relied on the use of strikes by unmanned spy drones, particularly in Pakistan and Yemen. The highly secretive program has faced criticism from congressional lawmakers who have questioned its scope and legality. Even though CIA drone strikes in Pakistan have steeply declined from a peak of around 128 in 2010, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which tracks each strike reported by the media- there have been seven drone strikes in Pakistan so far this year, the group said.","Obama put in place tougher rules on drone strikes in 2013 to cut down on civilian deaths, but CIA got an exemption .

"Conflicting stance: Ed Miliband, pictured during a speech yesterday, will today announce a 'clear, credible plan' on immigration . Ed Miliband will today claim Labour’s attitude to immigration has ‘changed’ – despite still refusing to put any upper limit on the numbers allowed in. In an audacious move, the Labour leader will insist that he offers a ‘clear, credible and concrete plan on immigration – not false promises’. He will say: ‘We will deal with people’s concerns because we have listened, we have learned and we have changed.’ But, only hours before the key election speech was due to be delivered, his own shadow home secretary refused at least four times to say Labour would put a target on net immigration. Under intense pressure during a home affairs debate on the BBC’s Daily Politics Show, Yvette Cooper would say only she wanted the number to be lower than the current 300,000. Presenter Andrew Neil had pointed out that, in office, Labour had ‘virtually opened the door’ to record migration. During Labour’s 13 years in power, the foreign-born population rocketed by 3.6million. Home Secretary Theresa May, trading blows with Ms Cooper in the debate, said: ‘The choice is clear. Back to a Labour Home Office which they admitted was not fit for purpose, or the Conservatives, who have a plan to reform free movement, cut immigration, defeat extremism and keep cutting crime.’ The Tories are fighting the election on a commitment to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’. Speaking in the Vale of Glamorgan today, Mr Miliband will claim that Labour would implement a ten-point plan for curbing immigration during its first 100 days in office. It includes recruiting an additional 1,000 border staff, banning recruitment agencies from hiring only from overseas and making it illegal for employers to undercut wages by exploiting workers. However, the Tories are likely to point out that a number of the proposals are already in the process of being implemented. They include the introduction of full exit checks to count people in and out of the country and ‘stopping those who have committed serious crimes coming to Britain’. Mr Miliband is expected to say: ‘David Cameron once promised to cut net immigration to tens of thousands – and told us to kick him out of office if he didn’t deliver. But, only hours before the key election speech was due to be delivered, his own shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper (pictured) refused at least four times to say Labour would put a target on net immigration . Union boss Len McCluskey last night hailed Ed Miliband as Britain’s next prime minister and said the country stood on the ‘brink of change’. The Unite general secretary praised Labour for a series of ‘radical’ policies, including the ‘freeze’ on energy prices, the mansion tax and the 50p income tax rate. And he praised Mr Miliband for planning to repeal ‘some of the worst anti-union’ laws with a commission headed by John Monks, the former TUC general secretary. Addressing a rally of trade unionists in London, Mr McCluskey, whose union is Labour’s biggest donor, said: ‘Our nation stands on the brink of change. ‘In ten days the people will cast their vote. They will pass their judgment on the last five years of Tory coalition, on the Labour Party and on Ed Miliband – as our leader and our next Prime Minister.’ He said Labour offered ‘something different’ and told the audience: ‘Is it radical enough? You judge for yourself.’ Labour would ‘end bogus self-employment and put a stop to the zero-hour contracts that have become a stain on our nation,’ Mr McCluskey added. ‘On tax they’re going to tackle non-doms, a 50p tax rate for those who can afford it, a mansion tax and above all tackling tax avoidance.’ He said David Cameron’s pledge to ‘finish the job’ of deficit reduction were ‘perhaps the scariest words in the English language’. Last week Mr McCluskey was caught boasting that trade unions ‘own’ the Labour Party and its policies. In the Unite magazine he wrote: ‘The Labour Party is our party, we built it, to serve us. These are our policies. They are now within our grasp.’ ‘But net migration rose to 298,000 last year, almost exactly three times higher than he promised. Nothing damages people’s faith in politics more than broken promises like that – or those he is still making today. 'I will only make promises I can keep. I won’t offer false targets or seek to exploit concerns with the politics of fear. Instead, I am offering clear, credible and concrete ways of making a real difference.’ He will add: ‘Immigration is too important an issue for our country to be abandoned by the Prime Minister so it can be exploited by Nigel Farage.’ Last week, David Cameron made a passionate plea to Ukip voters not to risk letting in a Labour government that will allow ‘a return to uncontrolled immigration’. Writing exclusively for the Daily Mail, he said he understood people’s ‘fears and worries’ about immigration. It followed a poll showing six in ten are unhappy with the Government’s record. Mr Cameron wrote: ‘Do you honestly think Ed Miliband cares about controlling immigration? No. ‘He was there the last time, remember, when net immigration increased fivefold.’ Mr Miliband has apologised for the calamitous underestimate of the number of Eastern Europeans who would arrive in Britain when the EU’s border’s expanded eastwards in 2004. But he refuses to accept that unprecedented levels of non-EU migration were a mistake. One ex-Labour adviser notoriously said the party’s aim was to ‘rub the Right’s nose in diversity’. ■ ED Miliband has revealed that a Labour government would legalise humanist weddings. The move could lead to a clamour for other unconventional unions, including Jedi and Druid marriages, to be given the same status as traditional weddings. Mr Miliband told Pink News his government would look to give the controversial ceremonies the same status as religious and civil unions. There was widespread support for humanist marriage across Parliament during the passage of the Equal Marriage Act, including from Labour. ‘We still support the legal recognition of humanist marriages and we’ll review the law,’ said Mr Miliband. The UK’s first pagan wedding took place last month in Scotland.","Ed Miliband will announce that he has ‘clear, credible plan' on immigration .

"Like the old saying goes: if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. A Melbourne based couple learnt this the hard way after a crowdfunding page they launched received a baffling pledge for over $2 billion. Within an hour, the momentous donation to a kangaroo preservation project launched by ecologists Euan Ritchie and Jen Martin had vanished, and they still haven’t been able to track down the would-be benefactor. Scroll down for video . Euan Ritchie and Jen Martin's crowdfunding page they launched received a baffling pledge for over $2 billion . ‘My initial reaction was shock and disbelief,’ Euan Ritchie told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I was very sceptical but a big part of me wanted to believe it was real.’ The couple decided to make the page after Indigenous tribes from the Northern Territory told them kangaroos from the region were disappearing at an alarming rate. ‘The importance of the mission is absolutely critical. Australia has the highest extinction rate for native mammals, and if we don’t act now we will lose many more.’ The couple launched the crowdfunding page in a bid to track the numbers of kangaroos in the area . In the last 200 years, Australia has lost over 10% of its native mammals, the highest loss of native mammals of any country in the world over that period. The couple launched the crowdfunding page in a bid to track the numbers of kangaroos in the area, and within two days they received the mystifying pledge from someone called Jeffrey Green. ‘I contacted Pozible and started researching online, and within an hour the pledge disappeared. It was very strange and I still don’t understand.’ Mr Ritchie was shocked when the crowdfunding page received a baffling pledge for over $2 billion . Pozible cancelled the payment because it was deemed suspicious, cancelling the account of Jeffrey Green. The website has since attempted to track down the mystery pledger but to no avail. ‘We still have no idea who would pull this prank on us.

"On Sunday, 36,000 runners took to the streets of London for the 26.2 mile Virgin Money London Marathon. For one couple however, these streets became a 26 mile aisle where they exchanged vows en route. Cancer Research UK runners Paul and Laura Elliott decided to do something different for their wedding day and combined their love for running and their love for each other, whilst also raising vital funds for a charity very close to their hearts. Fitness fans Paul and Laura Elliott decided to do something different for their wedding day and combined their love for running and their love for each other by tying the knot at the London Marathon .

The pair, who live in Clapham, London, ran across the finish line together under a shower of confetti. Speaking on Sunday, 34-year-old Laura said: 'It has been an absolutely incredible day, the atmosphere has been electric and to be able to share it all with our family and friends has made it really special. 'We’ve done so much training together that I found running the first half on my own a bit strange but it made our reunion even more meaningful. The last leg was definitely tough but I think we were both so euphoric and had such great support from the crowds that we were carried round.'

"Hearing the scurry of tiny claws across the kitchen worktop can produce feelings of disgust and despair in home owners. Now an animal welfare charity claims to have a solution to help households rid themselves of mouse infestations - lending them a cat for the day. Wood Green animal charity has teamed up with a cleaning and DIY app to offer customers a cat fostering service. Wood Green animal charity has teamed up with cleaning and DIY app Handy to offer customers a cat fostering service. Cats will not just catch mice but the scent they leave behind can also discourage rodents from returning . The north London-based charity say that the presence of a cat and the scent it leaves behind will often be enough to scare away unwanted rodents. Juliette Jones, animal welfare consultant at Wood Green, said: 'We have more than 200 cats in need of good homes, some of which will benefit from being cared for temporarily in a home environment, until they find their forever homes. Cutting the lawn can be a hassle - you need to get out the mower, trim the edges and then there is what you do with the cuttings. But Amazon is now apparently offering a solution - by allowing you to rent a goat. The Goat Grazer Beta service allows homeowners to keep your lawn trim. It also offers goats as a way of keeping all manner of other unruly vegetation under control. According to Amazon's website: 'Goats can eat tons of stuff! 'They're curious little creatures that like to at least taste almost anything resembling a plant. 'They actually love to munch away at many types of vegetation that we find invasive, ugly, or harmful to humans. 'Goats can eat thistle, blackberry, English Ivy, kudzu, poison ivy, poison sumac, poison oak, wisteria, various grasses, and more. Your pro will be able to let you know for sure ' Sadly the service is only available in the US at the moment. It is also not the first company to offer goats as a way of mowing the lawn. California based Rent-a-Goat say its hooved 'grass guzzling machines' are 50% cheaper than hiring a human to do the job. 'We hope this unique service will open people's minds to the positive impact - both practical and emotional - of having a loveable feline in residence.' The service is being provided through the Handy smartphone app, which allows users to book cleaners and handymen for home repairs. The app allows householders to choose the cat they want to visit their home and offers photos and background for each member of the feline mousing team. Those looking to borrow a cat to help rid their homes of a mouse infestation are asked to be 'flexible, patient and caring towards the animals'. The charity provides litter trays, feed and bedding to help foster families look after their pet. The service is only available in London within driving distance of Wood Green for now. Rodent infestations are a particular problem in the winter months when mice move inside to escape the colder weather. However, once established, a mice colony will often stay in a home for generations and can be difficult to be rid of. They are not only considered to be unhygienic but also can cause damage by chewing through wires and furniture to make bedding. Few insurance companies will cover damage caused by pests. The most common way to tackle a rodent problem is with traps, but home improvement shops also sell electronic deterrents. Natural plants such as mint and basil are also said to keep rodents away. Juliette Jones said that cats were an effective and natural alternative. She said: 'The cats have this desired effect because they are constantly giving off invisible signals around the place. 'When a cat rubs his or herself against your leg unfortunately he is not showing affection. Instead he or she is marking their territory and sending a message to other animals, in particular mice. 'The reason why a ‘mouser’ is the best way to get rid of pesky vermin is that it is humane. The cats don’t need to do any mouse catching - their sheer presence alone will have any mice leaving the premises, repelled by the cat’s pheromones. 'Because of this, homeowners need not worry about finding dead mice about the house, nor that they might have any mousey blood on their hands.' Pete Dowds, Handy's UK manager, said the new scheme had been created as a result of an increasing number of requests from Handy customers for cleaners to bring in cats with them in order to help scare away mice. Pearl (above) is one of the cats who is being offered for free as part of a cleaning service to tackle mice. Those looking to borrow a cat to help rid their homes of a mouse infestation are asked to be 'flexible, patient and caring towards the animals'. The charity provides litter trays, feed and bedding . Photos of the cats, like Dash (left) and Peppy (right), appear on the Handy cleaning and DIY service app along with details about the animals' life stories. Homeowners can then book them to foster them for a few days . 'Mice are unwelcome residents in homes across the capital. 'In the past, our cleaners have been asked to bring in moggies to scare rodents, so we were delighted to take the unusual step of being able to offer 'foster-able' felines from Wood Green alongside our more typical cleaning and DIY services. 'Naturally, this is all about the cats, and we hope that Londoners will fall in love with some of the attractive mousers that come to stay: potentially turning temporary residences into permanent ones as a result.'

"Researchers found women judged to have pretty faces also have voices regarded by men as appealing (file picture) Men can judge how attractive a woman is by hearing her talk, according to a study. Researchers found women judged to have pretty faces also have voices regarded by men as appealing. ‘People can make quite reliable guesses about women’s facial attractiveness on the basis of their voices,’ said study co-author Markus Koppensteiner, an anthropologist from the University of Vienna. He added: ‘Attractive voices may create an idea about what a woman will look like.’ Researchers photographed the faces and recorded the voices of 42 women with an average age of 24. They then asked a group of men – with an average age of mid 20s – to rate the women’s voices on attractiveness and another group of similar age to judge the attractiveness of their faces. Those rated highly for looks often scored well for sound too, with the study finding a ‘significant relationship between males’ ratings of female faces and voices. Findings suggest that women with an attractive face also tend to have an attractive voice’. The scientists also mapped the shape, size and layout of the women’s faces to work out which facial traits were considered to be more attractive both physically and vocally. They found women deemed the most attractive tended to have ‘lifted jawbones, less robust jaws and fuller lips’. The research could shed light on the visual and vocal appeal of radio broadcasters such as Fearne Cotton. Mr Koppensteiner added: ‘It could explain why women who have made it (on radio) also have attractive faces.’ Previous research has indicated women also pay close attention to men’s voices, preferring a deeper pitch because they associate it with a larger body size.

"A 10-year-old autistic boy has hand-delivered a heartbreaking poster  to the Immigration Minister pleading to be allowed to stay in the country he has called home for the past eight years. The touching words were written by Tyrone Sevilla and delivered to Peter Dutton's office in Brisbane on Monday, along with a petition containing 122,000 signatures. The poster simply said: 'Dear Mr Sutton, Can I stay in Australia please. Tyrone.' Maria Sevilla and her young son's desperate last-ditch attempt to remain in the country comes as they face the very real possibility of being deported back to the Philippines after their visa expires today. This comes after the Immigration department rejected the single mother's visa application 28 days ago because Tyrone's autism would be a 'burden on the Australian health system'. Scroll down for video . Tyrone Sevilla hand delivered this heart breaking message to Immigration minister Peter Dutton's office on Monday begging to stay in Australia where he has lived with his mother for eight years . Tyrone and his mother Maria Sevilla (left) face the very real possibility of being deported back to the Philippines as their visa expires today - Monday . Ms Sevilla told Daily Mail Australia about the anguish her son would experience if they were forced to leave the country they love so dearly. 'Most of my immediate family are here and we have integrated into the community and Tyrone has lots of friends and loves his school,' she said. She said she was concerned about how her son's condition meant he doesn't adapt well to change. 'When I drop him at daycare before I go to work and I take a different route he gets upset.' The thought of being sent back to the Philippines is also overwhelming for Ms Sevilla. 'I'm scared to leave to tell you the truth - how would I cope starting over again?' she said. 'I would have to rely heavily on my parents who are not getting any younger.' Tyrone goes to a school in Townsville in Northern Queensland which caters for his special needs and Ms Sevilla works as a nurse at Townsville hospital. Ms Sevilla said her son has improved immeasurably since he started school four years ago. 'My friends can see that he has changed tremendously,' she said. 'Before he started at the school he couldn't sit still for five seconds and I couldn't let go of his hand in the street because he would run off - but now I just call his name and he comes.' Tyrone has excelled since starting at a specialised school in Townsville four years ago . Due to Tyrone's autism, he does not adapt to change very well . Earlier this month, the Queensland government labelled the Federal Government's decision to deport Ms Sevilla and her son as 'cold and heartless'. Ms Sevilla said she did not want to be a burden, and was working in Australia in an effort to give her son the best possible 'future'. Queensland Disabilities Minister Coralee O'Rourke called it a 'cold, heartless decision' by the Federal Government. 'I call on them to reverse the decision,' she said, according to the ABC. Ms Sevilla said she hoped Mr Dutton would exercise his ministerial power and allow them to stay. 'It's like, I'm pleading for our life, for Tyrone's future,' she said. A spokeswoman for Minister Dutton said the Migration Review Tribunal had reviewed the case and affirmed the original decision. 'Most visas for Australia require applicants to meet the health requirements set out in Australian migration law,' the spokeswoman said. 'The health requirements are an objective assessment to determine whether the care of an individual during their stay in Australia would likely result in significant costs on the Australian community. 'The visa was refused because the child did not meet the health requirement.' Ms Sevilla, a single mum and nurse in the Queensland town of Townsville, has lived in Australia with her son since 2007. She says it is the only place he knows, and he only knows English . Maria Sevilla has lived in Australia since 2007, when she arrived in the Queensland town of Townsville - a single mother wanting to become a nurse, in the hope of finding a better life for herself and for her baby. Her son was diagnosed with autism at the age of two, six months after they arrived in Australia. Ms Sevilla told Daily Mail Australia the new life in Australia 'changed everything' for her and her son, and she was able to fulfill her 'dream' of working as a nurse. It was not possible for Ms Sevilla to work as a nurse in the Philippines, where she said university is only possible for 'well-off families'. 'Coming here and becoming a nurse has given me assurance for our future and a sense of fulfilment,' she said. Ms Sevilla also rejected claims her son will be a burden on the country. 'All of it could be taken away because the government thinks that children with autism are going to be more of a cost to Australian society than a benefit – but that's just not true,' she said. Ms Sevilla has made a petition and is appealing the decision to send herself and her son back to the Philippines - a place where she has no family and no network of support . 'Everything is here for us. My work, our family, our home is here, Tyrone's school.' Ms Sevilla's application for a Skilled-Region visa subclass 489 was rejected by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection due to Tyrone's autism. The rejection letter states that Tyrone 'has a severe autism spectrum disorder, a condition that is likely to be permanent in nature'. It stated that he would likely need special education services, state disability services, Commonwealth disability services and residential care services. 'Tyrone would be likely to result in a significant cost to the Australian community in the areas of health care,' the rejection letter said. A spokeswoman for then-Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement accompanying the initial rejection: 'The visa was refused because the child did not meet the health requirement.' 'The applicant was advised of her options for independent review of the decision. People can only seek ministerial intervention once a refusal decision has been upheld at merits review'. Tyrone is a 'very cheeky, happy little boy' who is thriving at his specialised school in Townsville . Before appealing the decision, Ms Sevilla said she had received heartwarming support from many Australians. 'I have received so many messages from mums of children with autism; it's very prevalent in Australia,' Ms Sevilla said . 'As a mother of a child with autism, I know it isn't a disease you have to cure, but one you have to manage. 'Tyrone is a happy child with full of life attitude and can lighten the mood of a room with his presence. 'The idea that he can't contribute because of his condition is just wrong. People with autism can be excellent at a whole range of things; he just needs to be given a chance.' Due to Tyrone's autism, even minor changes to their routines troubles him, meaning having their deportation would cause enormous issues for the little boy. 'But if we're asked to go back to the Philippines, we'd have to start from scratch. Tyrone only knows English. He only knows life in Australia.' Ms Sevilla is sad, not angry, that the Immigration Department does not understand Autism, and says that her son deserves a chance . Ms Sevilla lives with her brother and his wife, with her mother only fifteen minutes away - or as Ms Sevilla explains it 'just a phone call away'. They are a crucial support for her and adored by Tyrone . Ms Sevilla says there is no support for them in the Philippines, compared to Australia, where her beloved mother, brother, sister-in-law, aunty, uncle and cousins live. She says they are a crucial support, caring for Tyrone when she is on night shift. 'I have found a better life for my family in Australia with my close family. My mother, stepfather and Tyrone's uncle and aunty are so important for Tyrone and I. 'They are a big help, as any single mum would understand.' Ms Sevilla says that through all her challenges, Australia has been a safe, caring place for her and her son. 'I have a lot of support from the community. I have my family. I have never felt alone.'

"Awkward photos of the New Zealand Prime Minister pulling multiple young girls' ponytails are being posted on social media just days after he was forced to apologise to a waitress for touching her hair while she was at work. Prime Minister John Key said sorry to waitress Amanda Bailey, 26, after she wrote a post on a blog site shaming him for his behaviour and saying it made her 'uncomfortable'. After the incident, Reddit users started tracking down old pictures and videos of Mr Key touching other young girls' hair and collecting them on a Tumblr page. Scroll down for video . Awkward photos of the New Zealand PM pulling \young girls' ponytails are being posted on social media . This comes after he was forced to apologise to am Auckland waitress for touching her hair at work . The waitress at the centre of the ponytail storm told the New Zealand Herald that she published the details of John Key's behaviour, which she experienced while she was working at a cafe in Auckland, as she 'expected more from him' and wanted 'the public to be aware'. The 26-year-old, an employee at Rosie cafe which is frequented by Mr Key and his wife, recounted on The Daily Blog how the Prime Minister kept playfully pulling her hair despite being told to stop during election time last year. Ms Bailey told the Herald that she felt Mr Key's behaviour was inappropriate. 'I didn't feel I should have to put up with that,' she said. 'I expected more from him and I want the public to be aware. 'John Key feels he is untouchable.' Mr Key said sorry to waitress Amanda Bailey (right), 26, after she wrote a post on a blog site shaming him for his behaviour and saying it made her 'uncomfortable' Mr Key defended his pranks as 'a bit of banter' and said he had already apologised for his actions . Eventually, she wrote, she told Key's security detail she didn't like it and later told Key 'No' repeatedly and wagged her finger at him. When he pulled her hair again on a subsequent visit, she said, she told him to stop 'or I will actually hit you soon.' 'I really didn't like it,' the worker wrote. 'I felt powerless and tormented and I stepped out the back and I cried frustrated tears.' The worker said Key came back soon after the last incident with two bottles of wine from his own vineyard and gave them to her, saying 'This is for you, sorry, I didn't realise.' Key's office issued a statement Wednesday saying he regularly visits the cafe near his home with his wife and has a good relationship with the staff there. 'His actions were intended to be light-hearted,' the statement said. 'It was never his intention to make her feel uncomfortable and he has apologised to her.' A waitress has revealed how the New Zealand Prime Minister had repeatedly given her unwanted attention while she was working at a cafe in Auckland frequented by him and his wife  (pictured together) But following the publication of the blog on Wednesday, Mr Key defended his pranks and said he visited the cafe close to his house often and he had a 'fun relationship' with the staff. 'There's always lots of horsing around and sort of practical jokes and that's all there really was to it,' he said. '...I realised she had actually taken offence because it was all in the context of a bit of banter that was going on and so I obviously immediately apologised for that.

The waitress wrote how Mr Key kept being persistent with his hair-pulling antics, despite being told by his wife Bronagh to stop . 'She thanked me for that and said ""that's all fine, no drama"".' Key's office also issued a statement Wednesday saying he regularly visits the cafe near his home with his wife and has a good relationship with the staff there. 'His actions were intended to be light-hearted,' the statement said. 'It was never his intention to make her feel uncomfortable and he has apologised to her.' Jackie Grant and Scott Brown, whose company Hip Group owns Rosie cafe, told the Herald of their disappointment with Ms Bailey as she had never notified them of her concerns. They further stated that Mr Key is popular among the staff at the cafe in Parnell, east of Auckland.","Waitress Amanda Bailey, 26, said NZ PM John Key pulled her ponytail .

"She may have been shying away from the cameras on Made In Chelsea so far this season, but Lucy Watson proves her career is stronger than ever as she's unveiled as the face of another campaign. The reality TV star is every inch the beach babe as the face of Very.co.uk’s #cantwaitforsummer  campaign. The 24-year-old brings the spirit of summer to shoppers, showing off her effortless beach body in the fun and flirty high-summer designs. Scroll down for video . Lucy Watson showcases her toned body as the face of Very.co.uk's #cantwaitforsummer campaign . Lucy, who describes her perfect summer as 'sun, tan and chilling', showcases Ibiza-inspired summer brights and tropical print sun dresses in the shoot. The fitness fanatic, who recently starred in a Made In Chelsea work-out DVD, shows off her toned midriff in cut-out swimwear the brand say is perfect for taking you from the beach to balmy evenings in the bar. The reality TV star, who will be returning to Made In Chelsea in the coming weeks, is every inch the beach babe as she models the colourful clothes in the new shoot . The star, who can be seen showing off swimwear and tiny shorts, describes her perfect summer as 'sun, tan and chilling' Lucy models the Ibiza-inspired summer brights and tropical print sun dresses to perfection . Lucy, who, according to Heat magazine, is tipped to be making an appearance in the E4 show in the next few weeks, has enlisted the help of a personal trainer to keep her looking trim. FEMAIL recently caught up with  the fitness aficionado and the man behind her new physique to find out the workout that keeps her in shape. Speaking about how she developed a passion for health and fitness, Lucy, 23, said: 'I'm motivated by people around me and I just got to a point in my life where I needed a change.' Trainer and nutritionist, Ashton Turner, who owns  Enhance Nutrition LDN in London and trains Lucy, said: 'Lucy and I met when we worked together on the Made in Chelsea fitness DVD. 'Lucy was one of the cast members who took part in my workout. After the DVD, she wanted to continue with her training and I asked to work with her.' Lucy models cut-out swimwear and kaftans that the brand say are perfect for taking you from the beach to balmy evenings in the bar . Discussing Lucy's physique and fitness before they met, Ashton said: 'Lucy has always had a naturally lean body, which is thanks to her being active growing up and taking part in gymnastics and dance. 'She also leads a fairly healthy lifestyle and pays attention to what she eats. Her fitness levels weren’t terrible but they also weren’t where they could have been, which is probably due to her filming schedule but we all have periods where work or life take a front seat and exercise a back one.' Lucy, who cites her role model as 'amazing' Jessica Alba, said she found working out 'boring' and 'difficult' at first because she had such a busy schedule that she found it  hard to get into a routine. Lucy's typical workout  incorporates a squat or a deadlift, both of which are great for toning legs and glutes . She said: 'My days are always different and I could never get properly into it. I think it's just wanting those improvements with your body and health in general that motivated me.' Lucy says she likes exercise 'where you don't even realise you're exercising', like tennis or horse riding. But, she says, thanks to Ashton, who is always changing it up and is fun to be around, she never gets bored any more. 'I don't want to emulate anyone else's body,' she admits. 'I just want mine to be toned and lean. I don't want to lose any weight or curves, just tone up what I already have. I also want to increase my strength.' So how can we emulate her taut stomach? Ashton said: 'Lucy has a great flat tummy but isn’t looking for washboard abs. In our sessions, we concentrate on a mixture of core exercises like planks and side planks as these help to pull in your waist. 'We then add lower ab exercises such as reverse crunches as lower abs are often overlooked. On top of this, we add rotational movements such as seated twists. This ensures Lucy has both a flat stomach and a strong core for the bigger exercises such as squats and deadlifts.' He added: 'Lucy also ensures her diet is clean, luckily there wasn’t much we needed to change but its true what they say, abs are built in the gym but revealed in the kitchen.' Ashton and Lucy's typical workout  will incorporate a big lift such as a squat or a deadlift, both of which are great for toning legs and glutes. Lucy showed off her style credentials at the F&F AW15 show in London last week . Lucy has also been following a healthy diet, which she posts on her Instagram page, to complement her fitness regime. As her trainer says, abs are built in the gym but revealed in the kitchen . The duo then follow this up with mini circuits concentrating on working the body in single leg movements such as walking lunges and upper body push and pull exercises like press-ups. 'Every session is a full body session to keep her body balanced and injury-free and we often throw in HIIT (high intensity interval training) finishers to add in a cardio element,' he said. Ashton believes that, like Lucy, more and more women are embracing weight training, which he thinks is, in part, due to some 'fantastic and beautiful athletic role models out there'. He added: 'Everyone trains for different reasons. There are strong people, there are skinny people, but what is important is that people are allowed to feel comfortable in their bodies. Having people like Lucy show young females that you can enjoy life, eat well, train and reap the rewards is great.' Lucy, who is also the face of Wilkinson sword razor blades, has shared her top beauty tips with FEMAIL...","Lucy, 24, stars in Very.co.uk's #cantwaitforsummer campaign .

"Sleeping in the arms of their loving parents, these  are among more than two dozen babies recently born to surrogate mothers for gay Israeli couples who are being airlifted out of Nepal to safety. The infants - some of whom were prematurely born - were evacuated from the country on Monday following Saturday's devastating earthquake, which has so far claimed more than 4,600 lives. Several premature babies - and some wounded people - were ferried to an Israeli military base on one of the country's emergency rescue aircraft in the morning. The plane had previously delivered doctors to Nepal to aid rescue efforts. Later in the day, five more infants landed safely in Tel Aviv with their Israeli families. Some were seen resting peacefully in their carriers, while others were clutched tightly to  their parents' chests. Scroll down for video . Joyful: An Israeli man and his partner are pictured carrying their two children - include a newborn baby born to a surrogate mother in the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu - after touching down at an airport in Israel . Evacuation: More than two dozen babies born to Nepalese surrogates are being airlifted out of Nepal in the wake of Saturday's devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake, which has so far claimed more than 4,600 lives . Sunny: An Israeli couple disembark from an Israeli emergency medical plane (MDA) after being flown to Sde Dov airport in Tel Aviv . All smiles: One of the men beams as he carries his daughter, while his partner carries their newborn baby . Israel told AFP that it planned to airlift 25 babies recently born to Nepalese surrogates out of the country this week. However, other reports have said that 33 youngsters will be rescued in total. Many Israeli male couples have traveled to capital of Kathmandu to father children with the help of surrogate mothers because in Israel the procedure is limited by law to only heterosexual partners. However, in the wake of the 7.8-magnitude earthquake - which led to a series of avalanches which buried the Everest base camp - the new parents have been eager to get their babies out of Nepal. The parents who were pictured returning to Sde Dov Airport on Monday had traveled abroad before Saturday's disaster to collect their children. Four surrogate mothers are also being airlifted to safety. Also on Monday, five other flights flew to Kathmandu carrying Israeli rescue teams, IDF soldiers and medical crews in a bid to help victims of the deadly earthquake, according to the Jerusalem Post. Yossi Filiba, a  single father from Tel Aviv, said by telephone from Kathmandu on Sunday that he had traveled to Nepal more than three weeks ago to witness the birth of his baby girl, Na'ama. Flown to safety: Several premature babies - and some wounded people - were ferried to Israel on a small aircraft belonging to Israel's emergency rescue services (MDA).

He told Reuters he and several Israeli couples and their surrogate babies had found shelter in the ground floor of a building in the capital, and were waiting for the Israeli air force to evacuate them. 'We don't know when they will get here,' he said. 'The water is going to finish and I am with a small baby. There is very little food and no electricity, although sometimes there is a generator.' Mr Filiba said Israeli parents usually spend a month in Nepal for their child's birth and to make final arrangements to bring them home. The quake hit when Mr Filiba was feeding Na'ama at home. 'I grabbed the baby, ran down three floors and out to open space. All around us, small buildings were collapsing and people were terrified,' he said, recounting the moment the disaster occurred. We're home!

Israel's military had already dispatched an 80-member search and rescue team to Nepal prior to sending other aircraft carrying medical personnel, soldiers and supplies to the country on Monday. Mr Filiba said on Sunday that the planes could not come soon enough. 'There are cracks all over the building,' he said. 'I'm not sleeping because of the baby - which is a good reason - but I'm also not sleeping because of worries about the building collapsing.' Israel's parliament is considering legislation that would allow same-sex couples and single parents to have babies through surrogate mothers in Israel itself. It comes as four Americans are dead and dozens are believed to be missing in the Himalayas as families across the world scramble to find information on their loved ones after the earthquake.

Above, the scene of a multi cremation . The death toll across Nepal, China, India and Bangladesh has risen to more than 4,000. Nepalese officials have speculated that number could reach a staggering 10,000. Meanwhile, Care International, an aid agency, predicted it could reach 15,000. At least 18 climbers, including the four Americans, died after deadly avalanches also buried Everest base camp. American Google executive Dan Fredinburg, 33, was the first confirmed fatality on the mountain. New Jersey-born Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, was also killed when ice and rock crushed the 18,000-foot-altitude base camp where she worked as a medic for Madison Mountaineering. A third American, Tom Taplin, 61, who owned TET Films & Photography, and U.S. citizen Vinh B. Truong were also killed at the base camp. Mr Taplin was making a documentary at the time.","Babies flown from Nepal to Tel Aviv, Israel, with their parents on Monday .

"Amanda Holden today revealed that her sister is trapped on Mount Everest after the devastating earthquake – but said her life may have been saved because she had altitude sickness. The TV presenter said her sister, Debbie, had managed to contact the family to say she was safe after a 7.9-magnitude quake struck Nepal on Saturday, killing more than 4,000 people. She said: 'It's awful, I can barely speak. I'm still quite numb. It's hard to take in what an awful situation it is in Nepal.' In a fortunate twist, she said Debbie had not yet reached Everest Base Camp, where a deadly avalanche hit, because she was ill and had stopped off to recover. Numb: Amanda Holden has told how her sister is trapped on Mount Everest after the devastating earthquake . 'Awful situation': The TV presenter said her sister, Debbie (pictured, left, in 2005 and, right, in 1998) had managed to contact the family to say she was safe after a 7.9-magnitude quake struck Nepal on Saturday . Amateur video footage shows how a group of climbers ran for their lives as the Nepal earthquake hit at Everest Base Camp yesterday . Holden, who was interviewing search and rescue experts on ITV's This Morning, said: 'Very luckily she is at a place that is the last camp before you get to Base Camp one on the south side. 'There was only four of them left at that camp. Because my sister was suffering so badly from altitude sickness she didn't walk up to base camp – which potentially might have saved her life.' She said her sister, a scuba-diving instructor, had been able to send a text message to her family from a friend's phone to say she was safe. She said: 'I think they rushed out when the earthquake came and rushed back in because they were affected by an avalanche partly at the camp they were in... and I think they were going to make their way down this morning.' Holden said there was a possibility that her sister had been airlifted from the mountain this morning or could even have walked back down. Speaking later on Sky News, she said Debbie had sent an e-mail saying that she had made it safely to another camp further down the mountain. Appearing close to tears, she said: 'We are extremely lucky. I'm dying to hear her voice.' Holden (pictured, above, on This Morning with Phillip Schofield) said her sister Debbie had not yet reached Everest Base Camp, where a deadly avalanche hit, because she was ill and had stopped off to recover . Holden and her husband Chris Hughes were pictured in Manchester after having lunch together on Saturday . Medics and experts from the UK are in the country already and the UK International Search and Rescue team also dispatched crews destined for Kathmandu. The Foreign Office said it had not received reports of any Britons being killed or injured but embassy staff had assisted 200 people. A total of 90 British and Irish-born people are among the missing, according to a website set up for the families by the International Committee of the Red Cross. In a message to Nepalese President Ram Baran Yadav, the Queen said today that she was 'shocked to hear of the appalling loss of life and injuries' caused by the earthquake, adding that her 'thoughts and prayers are with the victims'. It came after terrified British newlyweds last night described how they cheated death as an avalanche triggered by the Nepal earthquake hit their Everest camp. Sam and Alexandra Chappatte found themselves having to cling to ice axes to avoid being swept away by deadly ice and snow . As the quake reduced many of the country's most famous landmarks to rubble, honeymooners Sam and Alexandra Chappatte found themselves having to cling to ice axes to avoid being swept away by deadly ice and snow. The couple have now been caught up in Everest's two most deadly disasters, after their first attempt at climbing the world's highest peak was ended last year when an avalanche hit the Khumbu Icefall, killing 16 guides. They were forced to abandon their ascent but remortgaged their flat in Notting Hill, West London, to fund a second attempt. The pair, who married earlier this month, described on their internet blog the terrifying moment the quake hit during their second bid to make it to the summit. They had left Base Camp and climbed across the Khumbu Icefall to make it to Camp 1 at 19,800ft (6,035m) when powerful tremors shook the ground. The couple, both 28, wrote: 'The earthquake hit about 30 minutes after we had crossed the icefall and found our tents. 'The ground started shaking violently but before we could react Dan [Mazur, their climbing group leader] was shouting, 'Get out of your f****** tents, grab your ice axes!' 'We staggered out to see an avalanche coming straight at us. A blast of wind knocked us down but we were able to get up and run to shelter behind some tents and anchor ourselves with our axes. 'We focused on keeping an air hole so we could breathe in the powder.' The couple are part of a 11-strong group of climbers led by Dan Mazur, from Bristol, who tweeted 'please pray for everyone' in the immediate aftermath of Saturday's quake in Nepal. Some 30 climbers are now stranded at Camp One as debris from the avalanche has blocked the Khumbu Icefall below them. Disaster: Homes have been reduced to piles of rubble in Bhaktapur near the capital of Kathmandu . The camp was also hit by a powerful aftershock yesterday, triggering three more avalanches. Meanwhile chaos broke out in Kathmandu as passengers attempted to fight their way into the international airport in a bid to leave the country. The city was one of the worst affected areas and centuries of history were destroyed in minutes as the quake saw many of the country's most famous landmarks destroyed. The Dharahara Tower was brought down and historic temples in Durbar Square collapsed. Yesterday 24-year-old Briton Tara Bradshaw from Brighton – who was feared missing – managed to get in contact her family to let them know that she was safe. In touch: Tara Bradshaw from Brighton, East Sussex, managed to get in touch with her family and tell them she was safe . Collapse: The historic, 200ft Dharahara tower in central Kathmandu before and after the earthquake . Debris: A Buddha statue survived the carnage after a temple collapsed in the city . And the Chappattes also were able to let their loved ones know they were 'okay'. But one of their worried relatives appealed for helicopter rescue for the group of around 100 climbers and sherpas trapped between two camps on Everest, where up to 18 people are thought to have perished on Saturday. Sarah Chappatte wrote on the couple's blog: 'All reports confirm that the icefall is now impassable so there is no way to climb down. More aftershocks are being reported as I write. 'They have enough food and enough supplies for a few days and some of the climbers are beginning to suffer from altitude sickness. Now we need to get them out.'","TV presenter said sister Debbie had contacted family to say she was safe .

"A 17-year-old Connecticut girl who was forced to have chemotherapy for her cancer has finally been released from hospital after she was removed from her home almost four months ago. Cassandra Fortin has finished the treatment a court ruled that she must undergo at Connecticut Children's Medical Center for Hodgkin's lymphoma, which she was diagnosed with in September. As she was discharged from the facility on Monday, the teenager said she was 'happy' to be heading back to her Hartford home after spending five months undergoing chemotherapy to save her life. 'I'm so happy to finally be on my way home, after 5 months,' she told The Associated Press in a series of text messages while traveling home. 'It feels almost unreal. The feeling of fresh air is wonderful.' Released: Cassandra Fortin, 17, (pictured with her mother Jackie) was released from hospital on Monday after she was made to undergo chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma, which she was diagnosed with last year . Happy: As she was discharged from hospital, the teenager (pictured with her mom) said she was 'happy' to be heading back to her Hartford home after spending five months undergoing chemotherapy to save her life . Cassandra, whose cancer is now in remission, made national headlines last year after she and her mother initially refused the treatment. They said they wanted to explore natural alternatives instead. But in January, a court ruled that Cassandra could not make the decision because she was not legally mature enough and the state's Department of Children and Families gained temporary custody of her. The case centered on whether the girl, who ran away during a home visit in November, was mature enough to determine how to treat her cancer. Connecticut's high court found that she was not. Some other states recognize the mature minor doctrine. Cassandra, who will be free to make her own medical decisions when she turns 18 in September, was surprised on Monday when her mother brought her best friend to hospital to bring her home. 'This day seemed like it would never come,' she told the AP. 'I can finally start putting my life back together. I look forward to spending time with my mom, friends and heading back to school/work.' Cassandra was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in September but did not want to receive the recommended treatment before exploring natural alternatives . But in January a court ruled Cassandra could not make the decision because she was not legally mature enough and the state's Department of Children and Families gained temporary custody of the teen . Cassandra was confined at Connecticut Children's Medical Center, where she underwent six rounds of treatment that doctors say will give her an 85 percent chance of survival. Without the chemotherapy, doctors said it was almost certain the teenager would die. She said doctors told her in early March that her cancer was in remission and posted on Facebook that she was grateful she had responded well to the drugs and never wanted to die. Hodgkins lymphoma (cells pictured) is a disease of the white blood cells . Hodgkin's Lymphoma is cancer of the white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands. These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. It usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50. Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent. Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids. 'I stood up and fought for my rights, and I don't regret it,' she said. In a Facebook post on Saturday, Cassandra wrote that she had 'less than 48 hours left in the hospital' and 'couldn't be happier', according to the Associated Press. The teen was reunited with her mother on Easter Sunday for the first time in three months. Jackie Fortin revealed details about the reunion on the 'FreeCassandra' Facebook page. 'What a feeling to hold her and tell her I love her! She greeted me by running down the hallway yelling mom with her arms wide open!' she wrote. 'This is a very special Easter Sunday.' In March, Cassandra told NBC she had not been allowed to see or speak to her mother since the New Year. Cassandra gave a list of people who were allowed to visit her to the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF), but said she had yet to see her mother or her boyfriend. 'For the most part I don't get many visitors,' she wrote in an interview  over Facebook chat. Cassandra told NBC that the guard who stood outside her door had been removed, but that she was still only allowed to visit the cafeteria when escorted by a nurse, patient care assistant or child-welfare official. The teenager insisted that she was prepared to try chemotherapy, but only after exploring other 'alternative' methods first. Jackie told NBC Connecticut that her daughter has long held the belief that she does not want 'poison' in her body. Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in January that the state wasn't violating Cassandra's rights by forcing her to undergo treatment. In January Cassandra called the experience a 'continuous nightmare'. 'It's disgusting that I'm fighting for a right that I and anyone in my situation should already have,' she wrote in the Hartford Courant. 'This is my life and my body, not DCF's and not the state's. I am a human — I should be able to decide if I do or don't want chemotherapy. 'Whether I live 17 years or 100 years should not be anyone's choice but mine.' Cassandra announced in a Facebook post on Saturday that she had 'less than 48 hours left in the hospital' and that she 'couldn't be happier .","Cassandra Fortin removed from Hartford, Connecticut, home in January .

"Kris Jenner looked downcast and emotional as she drove herself to a Beverly Hills gym on Monday as she continues to deal with the fall-out from ex-husband Bruce Jenner's TV tell-all. The Olympic gold medalist confirmed to the world on Friday that 'to all intents and purposes I am a woman' and said his third wife Kris, like his previous two wives, knew about his desire to be female. Diane Sawyer said during the ABC 20/20 special that Kris had declined to comment on her husband's gender transition even though previous two wives issued messages of support that were read out on the program. On Monday, close family friend Kathie Lee Gifford said on NBC's Today that Kris didn't know Bruce's secret and she's still 'trying to get her act together' when it comes to dealing with the news. Scroll down for video . Glum: Kris Jenner looked drawn and downcast as she took a trip to the gym in Beverly hills on Monday morning . Emotional: The 59-year-old appeared to bite her lip as if holding back tears . Lost in thought: It's the first time that Bruce Jenner's third ex-wife has been seen in public since his stunning TV revelations Friday night that he's always felt female and he now plans to live as a woman . Shocked: Kathie Lee Gifford said on Today on Monday that she hadn't seen Bruce's bombshell news coming and neither had her close friend Kris, saying that the momager was struggling to cope with the revelations . 'The other ladies, both fine women, had a long time to get used to this. This was new to Kris,' Kathie Lee told Today co-host Hoda Kotb. She said Kris, who was married to Bruce for 22 years, is 'trying to be a good friend to him - or her -now.' 'Trying to still be a great parent, and it's complicated in ways that we cannot even comprehend.' The TV personality is a godmother to Bruce and Kris' daughters Kendall, 19, and Kylie, 17, and has known the ex couple for years. But her version of events is clearly at odds with what Bruce himself had to say to Diane Sawyer, including the claim that had Kris been accepting of his situation, they would 'probably still be together.' He told Sawyer that Kris had seen him cross-dressing and knew that he had developed 36B breasts because he could no longer hide them from her. He maintained that he and Kris had 'a great sex life' and that she was relatively low-key when she discovered his secret. 'She didn't say much,' the former decathlete said. 'It was tough on her, he added. 'Kris is a good woman. I've got no complaints with her. She's a good person.' Defensive: Kathie Lee, who's a godmother to Kendall and Kylie Jenner, defended her friend, insisting she didn't know about Bruce's secret and his inner conflict about his gender identity, despite Bruce's claims that she did . Solo: The Kardashian matriarch was out and about by herself on Monday . Tough weekend: Kris came under fire after Diane Sawyer said she had declined to comment about her ex-husband for the ABC 20/20 special. Kris claimed she'd never been approached for a comment, a claim denied by ABC . Still close: Kathie Lee told her Today co-host Hoda Kotb she had had a conversation with the Olympic gold medalist before his tell-all interview was broadcast and is still trying to process how to deal with his transition . Kathie Lee, who's been married to sports commentator Frank Gifford since 1986, said on Today she was shocked by the news that Bruce identifies as female. 'I never saw this coming, I've got to tell you,' she said. 'It would have shocked me as much if Frank had told me [the same thing.]' But she insists that she is supportive of the former star athlete and reality TV star. 'How do you deal with that [the news]? The way you do, ultimately, is when you put love first, and try to put yourself in someone else's high heels I suppose,' she said. She also revealed that she had a long frank conversation with Bruce before his TV interview aired so she was prepared for what he said and also how to deal with the situation moving forward. 'We all want to love him through this and we all know there are children who are going to have to learn to deal with this,' she said. 'The story isn't over obviously. The transition goes on.' Spent time together: Kathie Lee appeared on the reality series Keeping Up With Kardashians. The close friend of both Bruce and Kris is seen here with the couple in an episode of the E! show that aired in November 2013 . Supportive: The Today show co-host is seen here with Hoda and Kris on air in 2012 . Kris herself hit back at ABC during Friday night's broadcast claiming that the network had not approached her for a comment to include in the 20/20 special. Gossip writer Perez Hilton tweeted: 'Kris Jenner has no comment for ABC news and the #BruceJenner interview. His other two ex-wives give supportive statements.' Kris tweeted back: 'F*** you Perez no one asked me to comment ....and I'm sitting with Bruce now watching this show so let's keep it real...LOL....' She later posted a more measured response on Twitter calling her ex-husband 'a hero.' Meanwhile ABC insiders claimed the KUWTK star was lying about not being contacted by the producers working ont he program. A spokesperson for the network told DailyMail.com: 'ABC News sent an email to her publicity team more than once. They called and said no comment.' Meanwhile, Bruce's eldest son Burt Jenner tweeted what might be construed as a dig at his dad's third wife and some others on Saturday. 'Having a hard time not putting a few people on blast who were not supporters before hand, but want to act like they were all along,' Burt, 36, posted on his Twitter account, according to UsWeekly . He later deleted the tweet. Scroll down for video . Pointing the finger? Burt Jenner, Bruce's eldest son, seemed to criticize some who he feels are being two-faced about his dad's gender transition in a Twitter post on Saturday, that he later deleted . What's the truth: Kris, seen here Thursday night in LA before her ex-husband's TV tell-all, watched the show with Bruce and blew up on social media when Diane Sawyer said she had declined to comment for the program .

"A woman who suffered seven miscarriages has spoken of her distress after a family friend stole the money set aside for her babies' grave stone. The bereaved mother, named Dawn, was appearing on The Jeremy Kyle show and accused long-term chum, convicted burglar Jamie, of making off with the cash. When one of Mr Kyle's famous lie detector tests revealed that Jamie, who lives with Dawn and her partner who is also called Jamie, had done the deed, she burst into tears and stormed off. Scroll down for video . Devastated: Dawn, who has had seven miscarriages, was furious to discover her friend had stolen from her . The drama began when Dawn, who has previously appeared on the ITV talk show, discovered that £207 set aside for a £500 grave stone had disappeared. Suspecting house-mate Jamie and his girlfriend Carol, she confronted them but was initially met with a flat denial. 'Only him and Carol knew where it was,' she said during an angry confrontation on the ITV show. 'Me and Jamie had been saving up and only Carol knew where it was.' Unable to prove it, she asked Mr Kyle to conduct a lie detector test and when the results came back, it showed that Jamie had indeed taken the cash. Caught out: Jamie, who has been to prison for burglary, was found to be lying after taking a test . Outraged: Dawn, who was going to spend the money on a gravestone, was left furious by the revelation . Mr Kyle also revealed that Jamie had sent a Facebook message to Dawn during the journey to London in which he declared his undying love and confessed to taking the money but blamed it on girlfriend Carol. Speaking after the show, a sobbing Dawn said:  'I've had seven miscarriages and only one of them I've had to bury. 'That was Daniel James and the £207 was put aside because the head stone was going to cost £500 altogether. 'We had to stand there and say goodbye to Daniel James and the last thing I wanted to do for Daniel James was put a head stone on him so he knew how much his mummy and daddy loved him. I feel betrayed, horrible. You try and do a good gesture to people and then you get it thrown in your face.'

"Around one in seven couples suffer with infertility and an increasing number are seeking alternative therapies in the hope it will bring them a longed for baby. Those who can afford it can turn to London's famous private medical haven Harley Street, where Dr Xiao-Ping Zhai has been helping women conceive for decades using only traditional Chinese medicine. Now she's invited BBC cameras inside The Zhai Clinic, which she opened in 1996, to reveal the secrets of her success. Dr Xiao-Ping Zhai says she has used Chinese medicine to help a thousand women become pregnant . 'I'm a doctor who initially trained in western medicine, then I studied Chinese medicine as I realised lots of problems couldn't be overcome by traditional western medicine,' she explains to Vanessa Engle for the documentary Inside Harley Street, which airs tonight on BBC2. Dr Zhai's methods include acupuncture and prescribing a bespoke combination of Chinese herbs which must be taken day and night. The herbs may be drunk as a tea or are provided as a vitamin tablet - 12 must be taken in the morning and 12 in the evening. The vitamins contain natural ingredients such goji berries, Chinese yan and ginger. Dr Zhai says as a result of her natural remedies: 'I have brought more than one thousand babies into the world.' One of them was advertising director Jane Parker's son Rupert. He was conceived when she was 40. Dr Zhai prescribes a bespoke course of vitamins - 24 tablets a day for two weeks - containing Chinese herbs to help conception (file photo) Jane, from London, previously told the Mail On Sunday how she fell pregnant using Dr Zhai's methods after two failed cycles of IVF. She said: 'I'd read an article about her, and had arranged it even before I'd had the IVF – she had a long waiting list. I was in an emotional state of shock when I saw her in December 2008. 'I was convinced she was going to tell me I was too old. Yet she was incredibly reassuring, giving me confidence without raising my hopes to unrealistic levels. 'She ran a series of checks including blood tests and scans. She only prescribes after she's been through the results. 'In January 2009, alongside regular acupuncture sessions, I started taking specially prepared herbs, following her advice on which supplements to take and made several changes to my lifestyle (including giving up alcohol, taking no vigorous exercise and avoiding cold drinks). 'One month later, I’d just returned from holiday and realised my period was late. I bought a pregnancy test and discovered I was expecting! I carried on with the acupuncture, herbs and supplements throughout the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. 'I gave birth to Rupert in November 2009 when I was 41. I genuinely believe that if I hadn’t seen Dr Zhai, I wouldn't have my son.' The new BBC documentary, which airs this evening follows May Lyang, 36, who hopes to have a success story like Jane's after five years of trying. She turned to Dr Zhai after losing a baby she conceived via IVF treatment on the NHS. Jane Parker had her son Rupert in 2009 when she was 41 after having treatment at Dr Zhai's clinic . She said: 'I got pregnant and I carried through for 11 weeks but then I miscarried a month ago. 'I think about it every day but you have to move on so that's why I'm here. You have to take positive steps and not think about what is lost.' May has an initial consultation with Dr Zhai which costs £250 for an hour. During the assessment, Dr Zhai quizzes her on her lifestyle and observes that she doesn't appear to be in the best health because of the appearance of her tongue and her pale complexion. But she tells her she had potential and she's confident she will conceive. May pays £300 a month for tea made from Chinese herbs. Further check-ups with Dr Zhai will cost her £130, while three sessions of acupuncture at the clinic cost £350. After a period taking the Chinese herbal tea, she is then prescribed a mixture of Chinese herbs in a pill form which must be taken 24 times a day (12 in the morning and 12 in the evening) for two weeks, costing around £150. The BBC documentary catches up with May months on from her first appointment with Dr Zhai and while she still hasn't become pregnant, she remains hopeful. She said: 'I've got the clinic on my side, this can happen. It doesn't bother me that I'm not pregnant yet. At my last consultation, Dr Zhai said I'm not ready yet, I need to fix what's inside.' But May adds that if she still doesn't fall pregnant, she will ditch the alternative therapies in favour of IVF on the NHS again. Dr Zhai said acupuncture aids fertility because it 'promotes your body's natural healing response and stimulates natural energy flow' In her book, How To Get Pregnant, Dr Zhai said her methods work for those who can't be helped by IVF. She writes: 'I believe that our success rate is high because most patients who have trouble conceiving are not suffering from mechanical problems such as blocked fallopian tubes (these can be fixed by surgery or bypassed using IVF). Goji berries are one of the ingredients that may be found in Dr Zhai's fertility boosting vitamins . 'The most common causes of IVF failure are poor sperm production, poor quality eggs, malfunction of the ovaries or the blood supply with the abdomen not being healthy enough. 'Couples who find it difficult to conceive have problems that can often be helped by kick-starting the reproductive system, improving sperm quality and quantity and improving the menstrual cycle.' She said the herbal medicine, combined with a change to a healthy diet and light exercise, can work because: 'Herbal medicine has powerful healing properties which work on the internal organs and the reproductive system. 'It aims to clear obstruction, rectifies the balance between yin and yang in the organs and helps to restore normal bodily functions.' She also claimed: 'Most importantly, herbs have proved capable of reducing chromosomal abnormality in male sperm and female eggs so improving quality of both.' When it comes to another of her recommended treatments - acupuncture - she writes on her website: 'Acupuncture is believed to work by promoting your body's natural healing response and stimulating and balancing natural energy flow (known as Qi or chi). The BBC documentary Inside Harley Street also looks at other alternative therapies on offer for various ailments. 'Leech therapist' Maryam Rahbari, pictured, says the worms can work wonders for the health . 'Practitioners are trained to understand that the network of the energy pathway (known as meridians) that connect the organs of the body. 'When one of these pathways becomes blocked or malfunctions, problems such as pain, illness or disease may result. 'By stimulating the specific acupuncture points, TCM [traditional Chinese medicine] practitioners are trained to clear blockages in the body's meridian system, with the aim of restoring balance in the body.' Acupuncture involves inserting tiny needles into the skin and is an ancient Chinese treatment that is being embraced more widely in the west for problems such as stress and back pain. It has not yet been  proven to help women conceive but it is thought to increase the chances - possibly because it makes a woman more relaxed. As well as looking at alternative therapies for infertility on Harley Street, tonight's documentary also looks at the other unusual treatments - such as applying leeches to the skin to relieve pain - that people are turning to when traditional western medicine hasn't helped them.

"In the ancient Inca kingdom, the wheel was yet to be invented, iron was foreign and steel was unheard of. So when the Incas needed to travel across the Andes, they did so on handwoven rope bridges, stretched over gorges and rivers. Five hundred years later, just one of the Inca rope bridges remains: the Keshwa Chaca, which spans the Apurimac River near Huinchiri, Peru, in the Province of Canas. Dangerous work: Local villagers work on renewing the Keshwa Chaca - the last Inca rope bridge - in the Andes near Huinchiri, Peru . Incredible skill: The 90ft long Keshwa Chaca remains thanks to local villagers who rebuild the bridge each year using the same techniques as their Inca ancestors . As they expanded their empire, the Incas built an entire network of bridges to move armies, people and goods quickly and efficiently over the mountains. Even though it would take another 300 years before suspension bridges came to Europe, it is estimated that the Inca kingdom was connected by some 200, all made by hand. The bridges were an integral part of the incredible Inca road system that stretches for 25,000 miles, from modern-day Ecuador to Argentina. The last Incas disappeared in the early 17th century, and over the years their bridges followed. The Keshwa Chaca remains thanks to local villagers who rebuild the bridge each year using the same techniques as their Inca ancestors. Craft: The ropes for the bridge are made from the 'ichu' grass, which is braided by the local villagers . Safe walk: Although the Keshwa Chaca bridge may look frail, it has been proven to support the weight of 56 people standing across the walkway . Ready to go: As the last Inca bridge, Keshwa Chaca has become a tourist attraction, with visitors paying a small fee to walk across the gorge . Ancient tradition: It takes three days to rebuild the Keshwa Chaca, which is done in June every year . It spans 90ft over the Apurimac River some 100ft below, and villagers claim it has been there for 500 years. In the Inca days, local villagers would rebuild the Keshwa Chaca each year as a way of paying tax, but in modern times residents of the region keep the ancient tradition and skills alive by renewing the bridge every June. After the bridge has been built, it is left to disintegrate before being constructed again the next year. The raw material is 'ichu', a type of grass common on the sparse mountainsides of the Andes, which is braided into rope for the bridge. Each household in the four nearby villages is responsible for bringing 90 feet of braided grass rope, Slate reports. The bridge consists of five parallel 'ichu' ropes, which are braided to be about four inches thick, fastened at stone platforms on each side of the gorge. The floor or walkway is of small sticks and canes, fastened transversely with raw-hide strings, and two thick ropes are tied between the platforms as armrails. It takes three days to renew the Keshwa Chaca, and although it may look brittle, it has been proven to support the weight of 56 people standing across the walkway.","Inca kingdom in the Andes was connected via handwoven rope bridges .

"Relief: Chrystie Crownover told GMA on Monday that she watched her ex-husband, Bruce Jenner's dramatic ABC Diane Sawyer interview with the Olympic athlete and their children . Bruce Jenner's first wife has shared the emotional moment her ex-husband told her he wanted to be a woman and how she kept his secret for 43-years. Speaking to GMA in a tearful interview, Chrystie Crownover, the daughter of a Mormon minister, told how the Olympic champion first opened up to her when they married in 1972. 'I cant remember the exact words because it was such a shock to me,' said Chrystie, 63, who revealed she watched Friday's Diane Sawyer interview together with Bruce. 'He opened up his heart and confessed he had to share this deep dark secret. He had to be a woman. 'I was speechless, I didnt really know what to say. I was pleased that he shared that intimacy with me. 'It was hard to wrap your head around, he was such a manly man. He never indicated anything feminine in his demeanor. 'It didnt threaten me or our marriage. It wasnt really a threat, or a problem.' Crownover told GMA that she was 'so relieved' the world finally knows Bruce's 'big, big, big dark secret'. Bruce, who has a son Burt, 36 and a daughter Cassandra, 34, with Chrystie, revealed he identified as a woman during a prime time interview with Diane Sawyer on Friday night. The 65-year-old told Sawyer that 'for all intents and purposes I am a woman' and 'can't live a lie any longer.' The decathlete, who has been married three times and who has six biological children, married Chrystie straight out of school and told Sawyer she was the first person he trusted about his gender issues and his cross-dressing. First love: Bruce married his college sweetheart Chrystie Crownover in 1972. The couple, who had a son Burt and a daughter Cassandra, separated when she was pregnant with their second child and later divorced. Chrystie was the first to learn about Bruce's gender confusion and has kept his secret. They are seen here at a gala event in New York City in May 1977 (left, and at home in 1977) Sharing: Bruce Jenner sat down with ABC's Diane Sawyer to explain his decisions and to talk about the road he's traveled in his personal journey to live the way he believes he was born to do . When asked by GMA how she felt when  Bruce introduce his 'real self' to the world on Friday night, Chrystie broke down in tears as she described watching the Diane Sawyer interview with Bruce and their children. 'That was kind of surreal. It was great because the family was together,' said a relieved Chrystie. 'I know its been painful for him. 'He was in pain, He was tearful at times, it broke my heart for him. 'I think it was cathartic to watch it together.' Indeed, Crownover revealed to Access Hollywood that she, Bruce and his second wife Linda and all the Jenner kids (including Kendall and Kylie), watched the ABC special. She said the atmospher was 'emotional', 'nervous' and 'tense'. When asked how Bruce left, Crownover said he left in a rush. 'Bruce was in a big hurry. There wasn't much that was said'. Gold! Proud wife Chrystie, who'd supported Bruce's amateur athletic career through two summer Olympics, was there to see her husband break records and win his gold medal in Montreal in 1976 - four years after he told her about his gender identity issues . Loyal and supportive: Chrystie, the daughter of a Mormon minister, has known for more than 43 years that her ex Bruce believes he is female and she has stood by him as they raised Cassandra and Burt (right) and now are grandparents . Now, in the wake of Bruce's brave decision to reveal his gender struggle, Chrystie thinks her ex-husband has given a gift to the world. 'Im sure there are plenty of people who dont have the courage to come out ever and they live dark tortured life,' said Chrystie. 'I feel it was a gift he gave to me that he shared something so intimate.' Bruce and Chrystie met at Graceland University in Iowa in 1968, where he was studying on a football scholarship. He and the Mormon minister's daughter fell in love and married in 1972, the same year he represented the US as a decathlete at the Munich Olympics. Four years later, at the Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada, Bruce took the gold medal in the decathlon and became a household name. He launched a lucrative career in commercial endorsements and TV guest hosting gigs. The star athlete and Chrystie had a son and daughter together but their marriage was already in trouble by the time he met Linda Thompson in 1980. A former Miss Tennessee and ex-girlfriend of Elvis Presley, Linda tied the knot with Bruce in January 1981 as soon as his divorce from Chrystie was finalized. Support: Bruce's eldest child, Burt, (left) said he struggled with the news, while his eldest daughter, Cassandra (pictured) has not made a public statement. Brody (center) and Brandon (right) who are Bruce's children with Linda Thompson, said that they are happy for their father . Difficult: Burt, Jenner's eldest son, admitted he struggles with the news, but still supported his dad . They had two sons - Brandon and Brody- before splitting five years later. The former Olympian was single for several years following his 1986 split from Linda. In his interview with Sawyer, he said that he had started at that time to explore his gender identity and took hormone therapy for about five years. He also had some plastic surgery. But towards the end of 1990, he met Kris Kardashian, the estranged wife of famed LA attorney Robert Kardashian. When Kris' divorce came through in March 1991, the two married the next month with all eight of their children from their two previous marriages taking part in the ceremony. Bruce became a stepfather to his new wife's children - Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob Kardashian. In 1995, Kris gave birth to a daughter Kendall, and in 1997 to another daughter Kylie. Bruce revealed that his third wife also has known his secret for a while. During Diane Sawyer's interview, Bruce Jenner's sons and daughter, Cassandra appeared on air and said they struggled to deal with their father's news, but support him 100 percent. Jenner's eldest son, 36-year-old Burt was also supportive, but admitted he struggled with the news. 'It’s hard for me,' he said. He’s always answered his phone, you know, ""What are you doin' big guy?"". ""Well, nothin' big guy!"" 'And now, you know, do I ever... would you ever call a female ""big guy""? No you would not.'","Chrystie Crownover told GMA that Bruce revealed his 'true self' the year they were married in 1972 .

"A piano teacher accused of sexually assaulting an underage student killed himself outside a New Hampshire courthouse hours before his case was declared a mistrial, authorities say. John Goodwin, of Atkinson, shot himself near his car outside the Rockingham County Superior Courthouse in Brentwood on Friday. He was airlifted to a hospital, where he died from his injuries. The jury was not aware of what had happened outside the courthouse when they decided they could not reach a verdict in the 75-year-old's case, according to New England Cable News. John Goodwin, 75, killed himself outside of Rockingham County Superior Courthouse on Friday morning while jurors were deliberating claims that Goodwin had sexually assaulted an underage student . Prosecutors said that Goodwin, who pleaded not guilty, repeatedly sexually assaulted an 11-year-old student from 2002 to 2005. The former student testified he didn't come forward until 2013 because he was embarrassed, according to WMUR. Goodwin's lawyer, Joe Welsh, acknowledged his client was 'touchy-feely,' but said he didn't commit a crime. 'He did hug his student, rubbed his back, massage,' said Welsh. 'It's not a crime. Whether it's appropriate, that's different.' Goodwin's trial began Monday. The jury had been deliberating for two hours when Goodwin shot himself around 11am. He was not in custody at the time of the shooting. The jury was not aware of what had happened outside the courthouse when they decided they could not reach a verdict in Goodwin's case .","John Goodwin, 75, of Atkinson, New Hampshire, went on trial this week on six counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault .

"This is the moment a thief fled the scene after stealing the sat nav from a 73-year-old injured pensioner's crashed car as she waited for an ambulance. The 73-year-old woman suffered severe bruising to her legs and ribs after her blue Vauxhall Corsa collided with railings on the petrol forecourt of the Asda store in Hulme, Manchester. She was waiting from an ambulance with her husband, who has dementia, when the thief sneaked into her car and stole the black Garmin device from underneath the passenger seat. A member of the public took a photograph of the suspect as he left the scene and walked across the grass with his dog at around 12pm last Thursday. A man wearing purple shorts was photographed leaving the scene after a sat nav was stolen from a 73-year-old injured pensioner's crashed car in Hulme, Manchester . The man is described as being between 30 and 40, with a beard and wearing purple surf-style shorts. Police have issued the photograph of the suspected offender and are appealing to anyone who might know this man to come forward. PC  Paul Brunton from Greater Manchester Police said: 'I have spoken to the woman and in her victim impact statement she has described this thief as 'the lowest of the low'. 'As she and her husband waited for an ambulance, injured from the collision moments before, what they needed was help and assistance but instead this thief took advantage of the opportunity, preyed upon their vulnerable state and stole their sat nav.

"A gel made from patients' own blood could help heal burns more quickly - and stop wounds getting worse. The gel contains platelet-rich plasma (PRP) - a concentrated mix of substances in the blood that play a role in healing. It is made by taking a small amount of blood from a patient's arm (amounts vary depending on wound size, but typically no more than a couple of tablespoons) and then processing it in a machine that spins the blood at high speed until it separates into its various components. Blood is largely made up of a clear yellowish liquid, called plasma, but it also contains small, solid compounds - red cells, white cells and platelets. The platelets are important for clotting, but they also contain hundreds of proteins called growth factors that are important for healing. U.S. researchers are testing the new gel it as a dressing for burns . Spinning the blood leaves behind the plasma and the platelets but in higher concentration - up to ten times greater than usual. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and is also used in some cosmetic procedures that claim injecting it into the face can rejuvenate skin - nicknamed the 'vampire facelift'. U.S. researchers are testing it as a dressing for burns. As well as boosting healing, it is thought the gel, known as Magellan Bio-Bandage, will act as a barrier against infection. The researchers also hope using platelet-rich plasma will address a common problem with burns, which is that they often continue to get worse hours or even days after the original injury. This can mean a burn that had initially caused damage to the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and the underlying tissue containing the hair follicles and sweat glands and smaller blood vessels (dermis) can become a 'full-thickness' burn. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and for cosmetic procedures . This is where there is damage to the third and final layer of skin - the subcutis, which contains larger blood vessels and nerves, and regulates the temperature of the skin and body. Full-thickness burns usually require extensive treatment, including skin grafts. It's hoped the platelet-rich plasma will allow the wound to start to heal before it can deteriorate. The U.S. trial uses a new blood-spinning machine that is designed to be used at a patient's bedside, collecting it in a syringe ready for immediate use as a gel. Previous research suggests that the high concentration of growth factors in the platelet-rich plasma helps stimulate growth of new blood vessels and skin tissue. It's also suggested that it reduces pain, though it's not clear why. For the latest study, at the University of Utah and other burns centres, about 40 patients will have up to 18ml of the platelet-rich plasma (about three teaspoons) applied on to a partial-thickness burn within 72 hours of the initial injury. The quantities used may vary depending on the size of the injury. Commenting on the treatment, Dr Bav Shergill, consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, said: 'This is emerging technology that is causing a great deal of excitement. Platelet-rich plasma is already being used by orthopaedic surgeons with some amazing successes. 'We are all looking for a method to collect and purify a high concentration of these effective molecules to improve repair in skin disorders. I look forward to large-scale trials of PRP showing similar results.' Meanwhile, a combination of platelet-rich plasma and stem cells is being tested as a treatment for knee arthritis. Researchers at the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine in Chandigarh, India, believe injections of both substances will help regenerate worn-out cartilage, the tissues that cushions the joint. Stem cells have the ability to turn into different cell types. About 40 patients will be given injections of either stem cells and platelet-rich plasma or just platelet-rich plasma and the results compared.","Gel contains platelet-rich plasma (PRP)

"A fashion photographer suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF) is revolutionizing the way people look at the life-threatening disorder by snapping the portraits of 56 adult women living with the genetic disease to bring hope to children and teens diagnosed with the condition, which has no known cure. Ian Pettigrew, 46, from Ontario, Canada, was working on his book of portraits, Just Breathe: Adults with Cystic Fibrosis, when he realized that he had far more female subjects than male. After someone noted that the collection of photos was 'turning out to be a bunch of hot chicks with CF', he became inspired to start his second project, Salty Girls, starring women with the disorder, which damages the lungs and digestive system. 'I know what these woman go through on a daily basis; everyday it's a struggle living with CF. And, to the uninformed, it is the invisible fatal disease,' he wrote on his website of the upcoming book, which is 'dedicated to showing how beautiful those fighting CF truly are'. Scroll down for video . Beautiful fighter: Ian Pettigrew, from Ontario, Canada, photographed this woman with cystic fibrosis holding her oxygen tank as a part of his second book, Salty Girls, which aims to bring awareness to the disease . Lifelong battle: On his website, Mr Pettigrew, 46, wrote that the upcoming photography book (pictured) is 'dedicated to showing how beautiful those fighting CF truly are' For those with the inherited condition, a defective gene and its protein product cause the body to produce a thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, pancreas and other organs, with symptoms including frequent lung infections, persistent coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, poor growth and slow weight gain. Mr Pettigrew explained that at the time he had seen in the news a model with Crohn's Disease posing in a bikini with her colostomy bag, as well as Tyra Banks interviewing a model with vitiligo, a disease that causes the causes the loss of skin color. 'I just thought well, it's time for a model with CF,' he said. The project's name, Salty Girls, is derived from the fact that people with CF have more salt in their sweat compared with those who do not have the disorder. Life of the party: This model posed in her lace bra while holding a Dos Equis beer bottle for her portrait . Still smiling: Another woman with CF wore a green two-piece to show off her chest tube . 'These women are inspirational and fearless, and we want to show hope for those younger CFers,' Mr Pettigrew noted of the women, who are roughly between the ages of 20 and 40. One of the models with CF, who chose to remain anonymous, revealed on Mr Pettigrew's website that the disease has led to her having 'countless body image issues'. 'It took a huge amount of courage for me to be able to expose my body for Salty Girls,' she explained. 'When I look at my body, all I see are my scars.' She added: 'I pick out every single thing I find wrong with my body, and compare it with other women's bodies.' The woman recalled growing up and being made fun of for the scar on her stomach, which was from her first of many surgeries. After years of being insecure with her body, she has vowed to take a stance. Proud woman: This model posed topless for Mr Pettigrew while smiling at the camera . Stay strong: Another woman with CF flaunted her tattoos in a black bra top and matching underwear . Badge of honor: One of the women featured in the book (pictured) wore a colorful bikini top while exposing her scars on her stomach . 'I will learn to appreciate, love, and nurture my body the way it should be. My body may be scarred due to all of the physical trauma I have had to endure with Cystic Fibrosis, BUT, it will never define ""ME"" as a person,' she wrote. 'It will define my experiences and how it has shaped my perspective on MYSELF, and EVERYONE that is struggling [sic].' She added: 'My scars tell a story of a triumph after every obstacle. My scars tell me that no matter the BS I've had to deal with in my life - I still manage to keep the fire in my spirit BURNING. That is enough to keep me going [sic].' Mr Pettigrew, who wasn't diagnosed with CF until he was 38-years-old, is looking to bring hope to children and teens with the fatal disease. Last year, Pettigrew traveled 6,000 miles to 25 different cities to photograph 92 adults with the disorder for his book Just Breathe. No fear: Another model rolled up her muscle T-shirt to show off her scars, as well as her arm tattoos . Important message: This woman wore a tank top that reminds others that she is beautiful . Eskimo-inspired: This CF sufferer sported a furry hat and nothing else when she posed for Mr Pettigrew . 'One of the goals of this project was for younger people with CF to see the portraits and know there is future for them,' Pettigrew told The Mighty. 'Yes, there are varying degrees and not all CFers are alike. But with the advances in treatment, proper nutrition and exercise, it is a far brighter future than even just 10-15 years ago.' According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, few children who suffered from the disease in the 1950s lived to attend elementary school, but now many people diagnosed with the condition can expect to live into their 30s, 40s or longer. An estimated 30,000 people in the United States have CF, and nearly half the CF population are age 18 or older. 'People still have to realize this is a fatal, life-shortening disease,' Mr Pettigrew explained. '[CF] is brutal and heartbreaking. But there’s a sense of hope and optimism as well.' Casual look: A woman with 'Salty Girls' written on her shoulder donned a black bandeau top and denim cutoffs for her portrait .

"As a wealth management consultant for a prestigious London firm, Craig Lister is used to keeping his cool. But lately, that's become rather more difficult. Craig, 54, is on hormone therapy for prostate cancer, which starves cancer cells by reducing levels of testosterone in the body - and has the side-effect of hot flushes. 'I have about ten to 12 flushes a day, and six to eight at night,' says Craig, a Yorkshireman who lives in Watford, Hertfordshire, with wife Sue, a teacher, 52, and their three children, George, 22, Evie, 20, and Joseph, 18. Craig, 54, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012. He is now well and his tumours have shrunk . 'I know when one's coming. The feeling suddenly builds up as if you've gone into a sauna. Within minutes I'm in full sweat. Five or ten minutes later, it's gone.' Craig has taken to carrying a spare shirt in his briefcase when he goes to meet clients. 'I'll turn up to a lunch and suddenly have a hot sweat and my shirt will be soaked,' he says. 'I nip off to the loos and have a wash and change.' Hormone therapy, usually given in the form of regular injections or implants, is the first treatment offered to men with advanced prostate cancer - where the cancer has spread beyond the prostate. It can't cure the cancer, but can help keep it under control. Hormone therapy is also given alongside radiotherapy to some men with localised prostate cancer to shrink the cancer and make it easier to treat. The jabs typically contain drugs called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) blockers. These act on the pituitary gland in the brain, to stop the production of hormones which are released into the bloodstream and bind with cells in the testicles to make testosterone. Even though the cancer is now microscopic he is still taking hormone treatment . The majority of prostate cancers rely on the hormone to grow. Lowering the amount in the body means it's less able to spread. In England alone, 13,000 men receive the treatment every year - in the form of jabs given monthly or every three months according to the charity Prostate Cancer UK. However, blocking testosterone can cause a variety of side-effects, explains Ali Rooke, a specialist nurse at the charity. 'Testosterone is a man's natural source of energy, so along with hot flushes we often see fatigue. It also has an important role in sexual function, so there can be a loss of libido,' she says. 'There can be mood swings and depression; some men also report breast swelling, nipple tenderness and weight gain around the middle. All of these are similar to what women go through during the menopause, when levels of their equivalent hormone, oestrogen, start to fall.' Hormone therapy also raises the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, and can cause bone thinning, because testosterone is important for bone density. Studies by Prostate Cancer UK have found that 80 per cent of men having hormone therapy will suffer hot flushes, and 27 per cent of these say it is the side-effect that troubles them the most. This rings true for Craig. 'People don't tell you much about hormone therapy at the beginning,' he says. 'I am basically a menopausal man. I have mood swings and I've put on two-and-a-half stone. But the worst thing has been the hot sweats. I'm up a few times a night, sometimes having to change the sheets and it's tiring. 'Of course, this wakes Sue up, too, and then she's worrying. 'She used to have hot flushes and so she's very sympathetic. The difference with me is that I don't know if they will ever end.' Men with advanced prostate cancer could be on hormone therapy for the rest of their life, says Ali Rooke. 'But men who are on it along with radiotherapy tend to only have it for up to three years until the cancer has been treated.' She says the charity receives hundreds of calls every year from men struggling with hot flushes and side-effects of hormone therapy. 'Men are warned about side-effects, but clinic appointment times are not long, so doctors can't realistically talk through them all in detail. It's also hard to predict what side-effects a man will have and how he will respond.' There are treatments to alleviate hot flushes, such as drugs based on the female hormone progesterone, which has an effect like testosterone but doesn't fuel the growth of cancer cells. Some men find that complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, or herbal supplements, such as sage tea or black cohosh, help, but the benefits are yet to be proven clinically. But now new research suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT, a psychological technique and talking therapy, could help. This causes hot flushes and night sweats . A trial on prostate cancer patients at King's College London, published in March, has shown such impressive results that it is likely to be offered nationally. CBT works by helping people understand the links between their beliefs, thoughts and behaviour. It's a recognised treatment for anxiety and other mental health conditions. Myra Hunter, professor of clinical health psychology at King's, has previously found that CBT reduces hot flushes in menopausal women, and breast cancer patients who are experiencing them as a result of treatments that reduce levels of oestrogen. 'Beliefs about hot flushes can exacerbate the symptoms,' she says. Professor Hunter believes that by replacing overly negative thoughts about hot flushes with more helpful, positive ones, they will have less of an impact. Her latest study recruited 68 men receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer, all of whom were experiencing at least ten hot flushes and night sweats a week. Half the group were given treatment as usual (access to doctors and information about the problem) and the other half received a self-help CBT booklet, a CD and two sessions with a psychologist. The men were taught breathing exercises, advised on lifestyle changes and sleep management, and encouraged to challenge negative beliefs and presumptions. 'Women feel hot flushes are a signifier of their age and reproductive status,' says Professor Hunter. 'In our interviews with men, we found the hot flushes signified a threat to their masculinity. 'They felt the hot flushes had social consequences - people would think that there was something wrong with them. And they catastrophised, so if they had one in the night they assumed they'd feel terrible the next day.' After six weeks, the CBT group's hot flushes were 40 per cent less problematic and 36 per cent less frequent, compared with 12 per cent and 16 per cent reductions in the control group. CBT is not always easily available on the NHS. Professor Hunter is hoping to offer her self-help audio guide and booklet for hot flushes free through Prostate Cancer UK, but this has not yet been confirmed. Craig was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer three years ago, at the age of 50, so quality of life is important to him. By the time of his diagnosis, the cancer had spread beyond the prostate to his lungs and to the lymph nodes in his pelvis and abdomen, so surgery was not an option. While the hormone treatment has been helpful, the hot flushes have been hard to deal with. He is about to try a new type of radiotherapy, but expects to be on hormone therapy indefinitely. However, he says taking the right attitude to hot flushes has helped him hugely. 'From the beginning I've been open about my condition, so all my friends and clients know why I have hot flushes. 'It's nothing to be embarrassed about. My family and I have learned to live in the now and be grateful for what we've got.' prostatecanceruk.org .","Craig Lister, 54, from Watford,  is on hormone therapy for prostate cancer .

"Anzac Day is a time to come together as one to salute our diggers who sacrificed and fought in Gallipoli, but it seems some have found another way to commemorate the special day. From pulling faces to complaining about waking up early for dawn service, tens of thousands of selfies from across the country have emerged on social media to mark the centenary ANZAC Day. Many had shared some special moments with their families and friends at football matches or a trip to the pub for two-up but others seemed to think the day was more about how they looked than commemorating others.

"She's enjoyed trips to Bahrain and Florence in the last week alone but today, Princess Beatrice was spotted in a rather less glamorous location. The 26-year-old was back on royal duties and travelled to Litchfield in Staffordshire where she opened a new classroom at the Maple Hayes School of Dyslexia. Dressed in a teal frock and a tailored black jacket, Beatrice smiled broadly as she arrived to the sound of cheers from a group of flag-waving children who had waited outside the school for her. Scroll down for video . Back to work: Beatrice arrives at the Maple Hayes School of Dyslexia in Litchfield, Staffordshire . The engagement is the second in less than four days for the Princess, who on Friday was in Reading to open the town's Talbot Memorial Garden. The space commemorates a little girl named Amelia Saunders who was once a pupil at Reading School but was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour and died in 2013. The multiple appearances complete an unusually busy few days for Beatrice who has come under fire of late, thanks to her penchant for international travel. However, Beatrice, who has no official royal duties, has long championed children's educational causes and is herself dyslexic. Criticism: The two engagements come after Beatrice was criticised for going on 14 trips in just six months . Royal salute: Beatrice got a salute as her convoy pulled up outside the Maple Hayes School of Dyslexia . All business: Beatrice was making her second official visit in less than four days . Cheers: The 26-year-old was greeted by a flag-waving crowd outside the school . The 26-year-old is also patron of a number of charities, among them the Helen Arkell Dyslexia Centre and the Teenage Cancer Trust. Instead, Beatrice is, according to her father's website, 'working full time in business' - although that hasn't prevented her from jetting off to glamorous destinations on a regular basis. Last week, the Princess was spotted hobnobbing with designers Karl Lagerfeld and Tory Burch at a fashion conference in the city of Florence. That trip came just a day after she was seen enjoying the company of Middle Eastern and Spanish royalty at the Bahrain Grand Prix alongside her boyfriend Dave Clark, 31. Enjoying the outing: Beatrice certainly appeared to be enjoying her visit and smiled broadly . Ready: Beatrice whips the covering off a commemorative plaque . And now for the big moment: She prepares to unveil the plaque in front of students . Sorted: The Princess poses with headmaster Dr Neville Brown as she completes the unveiling . Signing in: Before she left, Beatrice happily signed the visitor's book . More recently, Beatrice has enjoyed holidays in Verbier and Greece, as well as making several trips to New York to visit her sister, Princess Eugenie, 25. Like her sister, who has lived in the Big Apple since 2013, Beatrice's jaunts could shortly become a permanent stay following the announcement that the Princess has taken a finance job there. Beatrice, who has not had a full-time job since leaving her £20,000-a-year role at Sony last November, is yet to announce details of the position or a start date. Mr Clark, a Virgin Galactic executive, frequently joins the Princess on her international travels and was by her side when she enjoyed not one but two holidays on the Caribbean island of St. Barts in January alone.

"Residents on the east coast of Japan's Hokkaido Island had an unexpected change of scenery this morning after 1,000ft of seabed was forced to the surface overnight. The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places, exposing what used to be the ocean floor. Geologists believe the emergence is a result of a landslide nearby, when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop, pivoting the underwater area into the air. Scroll down for video . Surprise! A man stands on a clump of land that emerged overnight along the coastline of Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu, on Hokkaido Island, Japan . 'An aerial survey indicates that the land swell happened as a result of a landslide', local researcher Yoshinori Yajima told the Hokkaido Shimbun newspaper after he flew over the area Monday. The mass, which has risen some 30 to 50ft above sea level,  measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide, a town official said. The new stretch of land came as a complete surprise to the locals, as there was no indication of the land movement overnight . 'The local residents said they didn't hear any sounds and there were no tremors (when the land appeared),' said Katsuhiro Tanaka, the president of the Rausu Fisheries Cooperative Association, who viewed the expanded coastline the day it was discovered. The mass, which has risen some 50ft above sea level, measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide .

New view: Local residents from Rausu, Hokkaido, take a look at the newly emerged coastline . Authorities have not been able to determine exactly when the landslide hit the snow-covered coastline, but they do not expect it to expand further, said an official at the central government's Hokkaido Regional Development Bureau. 'Our understanding is that this is different from earthquakes,' he told AFP. It is not believed to be related to the 7.8magnitude earthquake that struck the Kathmandu Valley on Saturday, which so far has claimed more than 4,000 lives.

"Loretta Lynch was sworn in Monday as the 83rd U.S. attorney general, becoming the first African-American woman to serve as the nation's top law enforcement official. She said her confirmation as attorney general showed that 'we can do anything' and pledged to deal with cyberattacks and other threats facing the country. 'We can restore trust and faith both in our laws and those who enforce them,' Lynch said, an apparent reference to ongoing efforts to repair relations between police departments and minority communities. Scroll down for video . Vice President Joe Biden, accompanied by Loretta Lynch's father Lorenzo Lynch, second from left, and her husband Stephen Hargrove, second from right, administered the oath of office on Monday . 'We can restore trust and faith both in our laws and those who enforce them,' Lynch said, apparently referring to race-riot clashes between protesters and police . 'It seems like such an understatement to say my heart is full, but it is,' Lynch said. 'I have to thank the president for his faith in me and asking me to lead the department that I love to even greater heights.' Vice President Joe Biden administered the oath of office to Lynch at a Justice Department ceremony. Lynch replaces Eric Holder, who left the job Friday after six years as attorney general. The 55-year-old Lynch was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday following a months-long delay in which her nomination became caught up in a dispute over human trafficking legislation. 'Ladies and gentlemen, it's about time,' Biden said to applause. 'It's about time this woman is being sworn in,' he declared. 'We got tired of this wait.' 'But you showed such grace and such humility during this whole process,' he added, turning to America's newly minted top cop. Lynch paid an emotional tribute to her family during a brief speech after she took her oath. 'If a little girl from North Carolina who used to tell her grandfather in the fields to lift her up on the back of his mule so she could ""see way up high, Granddaddy"" can grow up to become the chief law enforcement officer of the United States of America, we can do anything.' She also outlined her hopes for the twilight months of the Obama presidency, saying she was driven by 'the desire to leave this world a better place for us having been a part of it.' 'The challenge in that – for you, for me, for all us that love this department and love the law – is to use the law to that end. To not just represent the law and to enforce the law, but to use it to make real the promise of America, the promise of fairness, the promise of equality, of liberty and justice for all.' Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer, the senior senator from Lynch's home state of New York, gushed about her personal story on Monday. 'She is the ultimate professional: thoughtful, hardworking, keeps her nose to the grindstone, and is able to bring both sides together,' he said. 'On very difficult cases where police and community leaders were at loggerheads, she was able to bring both sides together and earn the trust and praise of both.' Biden slapped his former US Senate colleagues, saying it was 'about time' they confirmed Lynch . Eric Holder, who left his attorney general post on Friday, served in the job for more than six years . Schumer called her 'the American dream come true' and recalled that her mother picked cotton, 'so my daughter wouldn't have to.' Lynch, a former classmate of the future Michelle Obama, was previously the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, which encompasses much of New York City. She is expected to serve as the top federal law enforcement official for the remainder of the Obama administration. The outgonig attorney general, Eric Holder, said Friday during an emotional farewell at the Justice Department that his time in office would be seen as a 'golden age' in the department's history. Holder addressed hundreds of lawyers and staff members, saying, 'I am proud of you. I'm going to miss you. I am going to miss this building. I am going to miss this institution.' 'More than anything, I am going to miss you all,' Holder told the standing-room-only crowd, many of whom embraced him after he concluded his speech. Lynch was born in Greensboro, North Carolina and grew up near Durham, the home of Duke University. Her brother Leonzo Lynch is the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Charlotte.","Vice President Joe Biden swore in Lynch on Monday .

"Vowing to cling on: Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg makes a speech during a General Election campaign visit to Sutton in south London yesterday . Nick Clegg yesterday vowed to cling on as Liberal Democrat leader even if the party is wiped out at the polls. Friends of the Deputy Prime Minister have previously indicated that he will quit as leader if the Lib Dems are reduced to fewer than 30 MPs, while sources have also suggested he will go if the party is left out of power after the election. But yesterday he insisted he would fight for his job ‘in all circumstances’. He told Sky News: ‘I’m really optimistic about the prospects of Liberal Democrats. 'Of course I want to continue to serve the country and serve my party, which I am so proud to have served for seven or eight years now.’ He added: ‘I want to lead the Liberal Democrats into and through the next Parliament in all circumstances. ‘All I am focused on at the moment is sounding the alarm about the very, very real risk that as the Labour Party and Conservative Party vacate the centre ground and hare off in which direction after another, there is a very real risk we undo all the sacrifices and hard work that have gone in over the last five years to put the country back on track economically.’ Meet and greet: Mr Clegg (far right) speaks to voters and their families during a General Election campaign visit to Sutton with Paul Burstow (second right) the party's candidate for Sutton and Cheam .

Mr Clegg also appeared to lean towards another deal with the Tories, saying he deserved ‘credit’ for forming the Coalition while he had endured ‘five years of constant bile from the Labour Party, who condemned us vitriolically for taking decisions which we only had to take because we had to clear up the mess they left behind’.","Sources claimed he'd go if Lib Dems are reduced to fewer than 30 MPs .

"James Staring, a London-based personal trainer, says there are four simple ways to banish belly fat . Many of us dream of a flat stomach and washboard abs. But despite dieting and exercising,  fat around the middle can be especially hard to shift. Now, personal trainer James Staring, from Fit to Last, a London-based fitness company, claims he has four simple tips which can help anyone achieve an enviable stomach area. From writing a food diary to doing short burst of tough exercise, he reveals the best ways to burn away belly fat... Avoid white bread and pasta and only eat carbohydrates after exercise . Avoid carbohydrates that are refined i.e. white bread and pasta as these enter your blood stream much faster. They are also absorbed very quickly, and cause an insulin spike followed by a dip in energy. Unprocessed carbohydrates (i.e. whole grains, legumes, vegetables and fruits) increase feelings of feeling full and release sugar into the blood stream at a much slower rate. This stabilises blood sugar level, so you don’t get peaks and troughs, and your body composition will likewise remain stable. According to Dr. John Berardi from Precision Nutrition, your body is more capable of processing carbohydrates directly after exercise – so this is the best time to eat them. HOW THIS WILL HELP YOU: When you consume excess carbohydrate (and, by extension, if your carbohydrate consumption isn’t paired with activity) these carbohydrates are stored for future use, often as body fat. Do full body exercises . The more muscle groups you use, the more calories you will burn both during and after exercising. By doing complex movements (i.e. chin-ups) as opposed to isolation movements (i.e. bicep curls) you are using more of your body at once, therefore requiring more energy. You will burn more calories after exercise due to EPOC (Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption). When you start exercising your body goes from rest to increased metabolic activity, thereby requiring more oxygen. Carrying out full body exercises will speed up metabolism and means a person will burn more calories afterwards. This will assist in losing inches around the middle . Your body’s delay in responding to this increased oxygen requirement causes ‘oxygen debt’. When you finish an exercise session your body ‘pays back’ this oxygen debt through EPOC. Your body needs to consume more oxygen to replenish energy and nutrients, causing more calories to be burned. HOW THIS WILL HELP YOU: EPOC has the additional benefit of increasing your daily energy expenditure as well as your metabolism, turning your body into a calorie-burning furnace, which will assist in losing those inches around the middle. Do short bursts of high intensity exercise . The most common excuse for not exercising is lack of time. But if you want to lose belly fat, you must exercise, full stop. Doing short bursts of high intensity exercise leads to higher energy demands and more calories burned, which will help shed weight from the stomach . According to a study from Canada’s McMaster University, high intensity interval training (short blasts of exercise followed by short recovery periods) enables you to achieve the same exercise benefits in less time than slogging countless hours on the treadmill. Therefore, you can actually accomplish more by exercising less. HOW THIS WILL HELP YOU: High intensity interval training will create a positive knock on effect in terms of EPOC, leading to higher energy demands for recovery and more calories burned for longer. Write down what you eat (including how you feel two hours afterwards) Writing down how different foods affect feelings can stop a person mindlessly eating, Mr Staring claims . Busy lifestyles often mean that eating has become a required reflex, not a considered decision. To get a sense of what you are consuming and how it is affecting you, try the following for 30 days… . 1. Try on an outfit that currently doesn’t fit – take a selfie wearing this outfit. 2. Start writing down everything you eat, and the time you eat it, in a dedicated notepad. Be diligent and keep this up for 30 days. 3.

"Residents of New South Wales who are already reeling from last week's wild weather are being warned to brace for more floods and damage, with another storm predicted to hit later this week. Meteorologists say early indicators show that an east coast low – the same weather system that lashed the state's east coast for three days last week – could hit the region, with heavy rain possible from Thursday. The State Emergency Service was deluged with calls for assistance last week and has more than 4,000 jobs from the 24,196 requests still to be completed. SES spokeswoman Stephanie Wills says the organisation is concerned that more storms will these hamper clean-up efforts. Scroll down for video . Meteorologists say early indicators show an east coast low – the same weather system that lashed the state's east coast for three days last week – could hit again bringing heavy rain from Thursday through to Saturday . Locals survey the damage and destruction caused by flooding in Dungog in the NSW Hunter region . Residents who have been hit by wild weather across New South Wales are being warned to brace for more floods and damage with another storm predicted to hit this week . People struggle against the heavy rain and strong wind on the streets in the Sydney CBD last week . 'Any weather that strikes up north is of concern to us, especially considering the devastation from the storm that hit last week,' Ms Wills told Daily Mail Australia. 'Any water is going to hit that saturated ground and raise flood levels again, and any wind is going to knock over the trees that are uprooted.' Ms Wills said the SES was particularly worried about the effect more wild weather would have on the Hunter region, which suffered through flooding and high winds in the last storm. 'That's our focus - the Hunter region - because they've been smashed,' she said. 'We really are quite concerned about that particular area. 'We are urging the community to prepare themselves, prepare their homes and prepare their families to prevent further loss and devastation.' Weatherzone meteorologist Kim Westcott said a trough of low pressure was forming along the coast, and would hit heaviest in the far northern parts of the state.

'It looks like we could get an east coast low later on this week, but it is certainly a different kettle of fish than we've seen last week,' Ms Westcott said. 'The difference is that it is a little bit further away from the coast and it is in a different area - so the heavy rain is probably not going to be over Sydney.' Ms Westcott said the weather system appeared to be moving quickly. 'We might get two days of rain but it's not likely to be the same three days of wind and rain we saw last week,' she said. Damage and destruction caused by flooding in Stroud in the NSW Hunter region . Bureau of Meteorology NSW regional director Barry Hanstrum said: 'Early indications suggest the main impacts of intense rainfall and strong winds will be on coastal areas in the states north east including the Northern Rivers and Mid North coasts, with heavy falls also likely for southeast Queensland. 'Current guidance suggests that rain will increase this week, and peak between Thursday and Saturday. 'Further rainfall is likely for catchments that have already experienced flooding during last week’s severe weather event.' The Bureau Of Meteorology said it was too early to tell how severe the weather system would be. Ms Wills said the SES would spend the next few days trying to complete as many jobs as possible, as well as warning people to prepare their homes should another severe storm hit. 'Obviously we're trying to get through has many as we can before next system hits,' she said. Ms Wills said there were over 1000 personnel in the field across NSW, including 200 from other states such as Queensland, Victoria, the ACT and South Australia.","Another east coast low predicted to hit New South Wales from Thursday .

"For eight weeks, the sight of a shirtless Aidan Turner swinging scythes and standing up to the nefarious Warleggans has been getting the nation hot under the collar. Now, less than 12 hours after Poldark ended with a dramatic cliffhanger, disgruntled viewers have taken to Twitter to complain of 'withdrawal symptoms' - and  urge the BBC to hurry up with series two. 'As if the Sherlock hiatus wasn't bad enough... experiencing #Poldark withdrawal symptoms already,' tweeted fan Mihaela Doaga within minutes of the closing credits. Scroll down for video . To be continued... Poldark ended last night on a dramatic cliff-hanger with the main man hauled off to jail . 'Ahhhh #Poldark, I'm not OK!,' wrote another, adding 'T'int right, t'int fair, t'int proper' - a reference to the catchphrase memorably deployed by Poldark's malingering servant, Judd. Others complained of having their Monday morning blues made worse by waking up to the prospect of going months before seeing Mr Turner, 31, and his famous abs on screen once more. 'The morning after #Poldark ends and amazingly, the sun has managed to rise in the sky,' wrote Turner fan AM Scanlon. 'Have a good week everyone, or as good as it can be.' Another, Luci Gosling, added: 'Waking up to a week with no #Poldark to look forward to. Gawd, life is tough.' Bereft: Poldark fans such as Suze Smith took to Twitter to complain about the show ending . Missing out: Fans say they have nothing to look forward to now the show is over . Not quite true: Poldark will be replaced in the schedules with Sheridan Smith drama, The C-Word . Painful: Others said they were experiencing withdrawal symptoms less than 12 hours after the finale . The drama has proved one of the most successful of 2015 so far, pulling in an average of 5.9 million viewers per episode and a massive 6.1 million for last night's finale. Much of that is due to Mr Turner and his smouldering looks which, combined with regular shirtless scenes, have produced a collective swoon among female viewers. But it hasn't all been plain sailing for the drama, which has been renewed and will start filming again this autumn. Poldark's famous scything scenes have sparked complaints from professional mowers who say Turner's scything techniques aren't up to scratch. 'The story of Poldark highlights the romantic aspect of the scythe and its use in history but we weren’t very impressed with Aidan Turner’s scything,' said expert mower Chris Riley, 56, last week. Next year: With filming on season two of Poldark due to start filming this autumn, fans are in for a long wait . Popular: Aidan Turner and his famous abs have been the highlight of the show for many women . 'There was a lot of sweating and grunting going on but the only time you’d mow like that would be in a competition.' At the end of March, an #AskPoldark wheeze launched by the BBC's social media team also descended into farce after viewers bombarded Mr Turner with indecent proposals. 'How do you ever stop looking in the mirror?' asked one fan. Another added: 'My mower has packed in - would you come round and scythe my lawn please?' Although the 31-year-old made a stab at answering many of the questions, he left the more risqué queries go unanswered. While the second series of Poldark isn't due to air until 2016,  Mr Turner's legion of fans can take some consolation from The Secret Scripture, an upcoming thriller in which the Irish actor stars. Scheduled for release later this year, it co-stars Melbourne-born actor Eric Bana, 46, The Social Network star Rooney Mara, 30,  and veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave, 78. Got withdrawal symptoms? Meet the hunks set to light up the big and small screens this summer . Poldark might be no more, for this year at least, but there's no shortage of cinematic and small screen crumpet, much of it shirtless, around this summer. Along with Mr Turner's upcoming role in The Secret Scripture, Clint Eastwood's handsome 29-year-old son Scott will please the ladies during his shirt-free scenes in new film, The Longest Ride. Like father, like son! Clint Eastwood's son Scott will be shirtless in cinemas from this June . Magic Mike: Channing Tatum and the strippers will be back in July with Magic Mike XXL . The film, which gets its UK release in June, co-stars Britt Robertson and tells the story of a former champion bull rider and his quest for love. Less romantic but with a whole lot of pecs appeal is the second instalment of Magic Mike; the Channing Tatum film about the exploits of a troupe of male strippers. Entitled Magic Mike XXL, it opens on the 4th July and along with 35-year-old Tatum, also features the Poldark-esque Joe Manganiello, 38. Also on the way is Southpaw, a boxing film starring a bulked-up Jake Gyllenhaal, and the remake of National Lampoon’s Vacation which features Australian muscleman, Chris Hemsworth, 31. Beefy: A bulked-up Jake Gyllenhaal will be appearing in boxing film Southpaw from the end of July . Lots to see: Chris Hemsworth, seen here in a Saturday Night Live skit, will appear in National Lampoon's Vacation and is currently starring in superhero flick, Avengers: Age of Ultron as Norse god Thor . Razor cheekbones: 29-year-old Tom Hughes will be appearing in The Game on BBC2 from this Thursday . Should the 31st July not be soon enough, Mr Hemsworth is currently reprising his role as Norse god Thor in superhero action-fest, Avengers: Age of Ultron. The small screen also has plenty to recommend it, beginning with new BBC2 spy thriller The Game which starts on Thursday and stars the razor-cheekboned Tom Hughes, 29. Season two of Vikings, starring another handsome blonde Australian in the shape of 35-year-old Travis Fimmel, is currently underway on History while those with Amazon Prime can enjoy the sight of Sam Heughan, 34, flexing his muscles on Outlander. Game of Thrones also has a pleasingly high muscle count, with Michiel Huisman (Daario Naharis) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister) among the hunks worth switching on for. Smouldering: Sam Heughan, 34, has been winning over viewers with his performance in Outlander . Handsome: Travis Fimmel is seen here making the Dark Ages look appealing in History's Vikings .

"Anyone who has spent hours sitting in a traffic jam can attest that cars are not always the most comfortable spaces. But some are considerably worse than others, an extensive survey of motorists found. The most uncomfortable is the Nissan Note Mk1 with a score of just 80 per cent, according to the poll of 61,000 drivers. Hot on its wheels is the Hyundai i20 Mk1 with 81.01 per cent and Fiat Panda Mk2 at 81.49 per cent. The original version of the Nissan Note was named the most uncomfortable car in a poll of more than 60,000 drivers . The mark one Hyundai i20 was named the second most uncomfortable car, with 81.1 per cent of the vote . 1. Nissan Note Mk1 - 80.00% . 2. Hyundai i20 Mk1 - 81.01% . 3. Fiat Panda Mk2 - 81.49% . 4. VW Passat Mk7 - 82.79% . 5. Peugeot 107 MK1 - 83.53% . 6. Toyota Yaris Mk2 - 83.93% . 7. VW Touran Mk1 - 84.00% . 8. Toyota Auris Mk1 - 84.49% . 9. Seat Ibiza Mk4 - 85.03% . 10. VW Polo Mk5 - 85.12% . Three designs by German manufacturer Volkswagen make it into the bottom ten – including the Passat Mk7 (82.79 per cent), Touran Mk1 (84 per cent), and the Polo Mk5 (85.12 per cent). Toyota had two entries, while Seat and Peugeot had one each. Unsurprisingly, it is brands associated with luxury that dominate the other end of the scale. Of the 200 car models covered by the survey, the ten most comfortable include five by Lexus – which also took the top spot. The company's RX Mk2 managed a score of 97.27 per cent, just beating its own GS Mk3 into second place (97.24 per cent). Jeep also made an appearance in the top ten, with its Grand Cherokee Mk4 taking sixth place with 96.55 per cent. And family favourite Volvo did remarkably well, coming it at third, fourth and seventh place. The MG3 came in tenth with 95.56 per cent. The second version of the Fiat Panda was also named in the top ten most uncomfortable cars . 1. Lexus RX Mk2 - 97.27% . 2. Lexus GS Mk3 - 97.24% . 3. Volvo XC70 Mk2 - 96.98% . 4. Volvo V40 Mk2 - 96.80% . 5. Lexus RX Mk3 - 96.74% . 6. Jeep Grand Cherokee Mk4 - 96.55% . 7. Volvo V70 Mk3 - 96.39% . 8. Lexus IS Mk3 - 95.89% . 9. Lexus NX - 95.81% . 10. MG3 - 95.56% . A spokesman for Auto Express magazine, which carried out the survey, said: 'Seat comfort is a big factor in motoring satisfaction, as it makes your time in the car that little bit more pleasant.' It added: 'It's a poor showing for Nissan with the Note MK1 languishing at the bottom of the seat comfort top 200, although age may now be playing a part. 'Volkswagen won't be happy to see three of its models in the bottom 10.' The most comfortable cars in Britain are made by Lexus which has FIVE models in the top ten alone - with the RX Mark 2 top followed by the GS Mark 3 in second. Volvo has three cars in the top ten and the other two are the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the MG3. Other categories in the annual survey include another comfort factor - ride quality. This takes into account how a car handles Britain's potholed roads and other conditions. Top of this list is the Land Rover Discovery and bottom in the Honda Civic, said Auto Express.","Nissan Note Mk1 was named the most uncomfortable car in the country .

"A Michigan girl dismissed from a Catholic school for not meeting academic and attendance standards during leukemia treatments has been invited back but will attend a public school for now, her mother said. Barbara McGrath said St. Joseph Middle School officials informed her that Rose McGrath could return to the Battle Creek school but postponed a meeting to discuss concerns until later this week to allow for 'a cooling-off period.' Barbara McGrath said that her daughter is attending Lakeview Middle School and that she can't say whether Rose will return to St. Joseph, a private Catholic school, until she determines if issues can be resolved. Rose McGrath, pictured here with her mother, Barbara McGrath, was dismissed from St Joseph Middle School in Battle Creek, Michigan, for not meeting academic and attendance standards. She's been battling leukemia since 2012 and has missed several days of school because of the recovery process . When Rose found out that she had been kicked out of the school, she tearfully said that she 'didn't do anything wrong'. The 7th-grader is in remission but still recovering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatments, which started in 2012 . 'It sounds like they're not going to pass her anyway, even if she goes back,' Barbara McGrath said of her 7th-grade daughter, who is in remission but still recovering from treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed in 2012. 'I don't see her being able to go back there and being successful.' The school wrote in a letter addressed to Rose's father that officials worked with her but absences 'hampered her academic performance.' It adds that the 12-year-old had attended 32 full days this academic year out of 134 days as of April 13, but Barbara McGrath says that doesn't include 'numerous' partial days. The school, which charges as much as $6,983 per year for tuition, also wrote that it has taken 'significant adjustments to our standards' to help Rose, including reducing her workload and paring down assignments and tests. 'Rose's attendance, coupled with her academic performance, do not qualify her for continued attendance at St. Joseph Middle School,' the letter read. It continued: 'We know Rose to be an intelligent and thoughtful child, and believe she would be well-suited to enroll in an academic setting more geared to homebound students, perhaps an online program as we have discussed in the past.' Though Rose is done with her treatment she still feels ill and has trouble attending her classes and finishing her schoolwork . Rose's mother says her daughter isn't skipping out of school 'to have fun' but that she has to miss school because she doesn't feel well . Battle Creek Area Catholic Schools' pastor administrator John Fleckenstein was not immediately available for a comment. He told WWMT last week that 'these were extraordinary circumstances' but they were necessary after 'so many accommodations were made' to help Rose. Barbara McGrath countered that the school made only minor modifications to the workload and her daughter 'had to do every single project, every single test.' McGrath added that, by her account, Rose was on track to pass this year. 'I didn't do anything wrong, but they still got rid of me,' Rose McGrath said tearfully last week to WWMT. Barbara McGrath said that though Rose is finished with her treatments, she has a long way to go. John Fleckenstein, Battle Creek Area Catholic Schools' pastor administrator, claims that the school made many accommodations for Rose and that none of them seemed to help her enough . Rose attended St Joseph Middle School in Battle Creek from kindergarten through 7th grade. Though she's been offered a spot back at the school after they dismissed her, Rose's mother said 'it sounds like they're not going to pass her anyway, even if she goes back' 'Even though she's now done with her treatments you still have a very long recovery process because you've basically just put two and a half years of poison into your body. You're not recovering overnight,' she said.. Rose told WWMT that school was the one place that she actually felt normal. 'When I'm at home, I'm sick, I don't feel well; no one else does that. But when I'm at school I'm like everyone else,' Rose said. ''The accommodations which were made were woefully inadequate for a child with such a serious diagnosis,' said Rose's father Tom McGrath to WWMT. 'It's not like she's out at the mall having fun, she's in her bed, sick with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. She's not having fun, she's sick. She'd be at school if she could,' Barbara said. Barbara McGrath said they have filed a complaint with the federal Office of Civil Rights and asked the private district to adopt an accommodation plan for ill students similar to those required in public schools. Rose appears to have had a large support system throughout her treatment. She told one news source that school was the only place she felt normal . St Joseph claims that Rose, pictured here raising money for St. Baldrcks to find a cure for childhood cancer, only attended 32 full days this academic year out of 134 days as of April 13. Though St Joseph as invited her back, she is now attending a public middle school in the Battle Creek area .","St. Joseph Middle School in Battle Creek, Michigan, had dismissed Rose McGrath for low attendance and poor academic performance .

Princess Diana came second just ahead of former England captain David Beckham, who was the highest placed male in the list. The Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton came fourth in the British style stakes with 1960's fashion icon Twiggy completing the top five. The poll, which was commissioned for the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S6, saw a major victory for the women in the style stakes as they take seven spots in the top ten. Audrey Hepburn won the poll, while supermodel Kate Moss came in at number 10 . 1. Audrey Hepburn (27 per cent) 2. Princess Diana (23 per cent) 3. David Beckham (17 per cent) 4.

Kate Moss (8 per cent) Bizarrely, just outside the top five was Queen Elizabeth I, with James Bond actor Sean Connery coming seventh in the poll. Music legend David Bowie came in eighth place, just beating former Spice Girl turned fashion designer, Victoria Beckham. Despite being at the forefront of British fashion for the last two decades Kate Moss only just scraped it in to the poll in tenth place. The study also revealed the biggest fashion faux pas once over the age of 30 - hot pants were voted number one for women and ponytails for men. Other no-no's past the age of 30 were mini-skirts and boob tubes for girls and skinny jeans and football shirts for men. But it's not all bad news as 37 was voted as the most stylish age for men and it was age 36 for women. The royal family got a good show - Princess Diana came second, Kate Middleton came fourth and Queen Elizabeth I came sixth . David Bowie came number eight on the poll, while Twiggy came fifth . The lucky celebrities currently at the height of their fashion peak include TV presenter and model Myleene Klass, Gone Girl actress and recent Oscar nominee Rosamund Pike.

"An anonymous Good Samaritan has donated $360,000 to pay for a man's mortgage after he lost his wife and house in the mudslide that swept Washington last year. Tim Ward and his wife of 38 years, Brandy, were at home in Oso, Washington, on March 22, 2014, when tons of debris, soil and rock came crashing down from upland. Brandy was one of the 43 people crushed by the force of the natural disaster. Tim, who broke his pelvis, was buried under 25 feet of mud, but managed to call for help through a gap in the surface. Just a week later, as Tim started trying to rebuild his life, he was informed he did not have 'landslide insurance' - and therefore did not qualify for payment to settle his mortgage. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Brandy Ward (right) was killed in the mudslide that swept Oso, Washington, in March last year. Her husband Tim (left) survived and has spent the past year trying to pay his mortgage, which a donor has now paid . Horrific: The mudslide on March 22, 2014, killed 43 people including Brandy Ward . For a year, Tim has been grappling with his financial predicament, while renting a small property nearby. He lost everything in the mudflow. Only one of their five dogs survived the mudslide, but lost a leg. The disaster killed their turkeys, chickens and four canines. The mortgage, however, consumed him. But last week, he received a call from Chase Bank, who said an anonymous donor had paid the lot. Before: This was their idyllic home in Oso where they reared turkeys and chickens before the mudslide . Love: The couple were married for 38 years. Tim said he heard Brandy call for him before she was killed . Overwhelmed: Ward said he couldn't believe it when Chase Bank told him the mortgage was all paid for . Speaking to NBC News, Tim said: 'There are still good Samaritans out there. This is life-changing.' He recalled the horrific day last year: 'She called my name and yelled, ""Tim!"" And from the moment that voice left her body, she had left the man she had been with for 38 years to be with the son of God she'll be with forever.' The donor told bank clerks they had read about Ward in a newspaper and felt compelled to reach out. 'I honestly have never seen this kind of an act of personal generosity where it's anonymous,' Phyllis Campbell, vice president at JP Morgan Chase, told NBC News.","Tim and Brandy Ward reared chickens and turkeys at home in Oso .

"It is a source of music, information and entertainment for millions of listeners around the world yet vast numbers of people are being denied the chance to enjoy FM radio. Many of the smartphones on sale today - including Apple’s iPhones, Samsung’s Galaxy phones and LG phones - come with built-in FM chips. However, nearly two thirds of smartphones do not have the feature activated. Now the radio industry, faced with the rise of digital radio, are calling for this to change. Many smartphones on sale today - including Apple’s iPhones, Samsung’s Galaxy phones and LG phones - come with built-in FM chips. However, nearly two thirds of these devices don't have the feature activated. Now the radio industry, faced with the rise of digital radio, are calling for this to change . Broadcasters, including the BBC, are pushing for the mobile industry to activate the FM chips within smartphones to allow users to access their free radio feature. It is thought many mobile phone network providers are reluctant to allow this because it would reduce demand for data used by streaming internet broadcasts. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) in the US, which has been one of the loudest campaigners on the issue, also warns that FM radio on mobile phones could prove vital in an emergency. It said that FM radio is the most reliable way of broadcasting emergency information during times of national crisis and by allowing access to it on smartphones would mean such messages could reach almost everyone, no matter where they are. Norway has announced that it will be the first country in the world to switch off its FM radio signal. The Norwegian Government said it will turn off its FM transmitters on January 11 2017. With the ever expanding number of digital radio services and growing numbers of people choosing to listen to internet radio, it seems likely other countries will follow Norway's example. The UK had planned to switch off its own FM service by 2018 but the plans were later shelved following objections from commercial radio stations. It is now not expected to happen until sometime after 2020 when digital listeners are expected to outstrip those using analogue stations. In the US, around 85 per cent of American adults still listen to AM/FM stations. The NAB claims that the top 10 phones on the market already include radio chips that are not activated and would have little impact on battery life. Jeff Smulyan, spokesman for the NAB on the campaign, told NPR that giving users FM radio would allow them to avoid expensive data charges and save battery life. He said: ‘Listening to streaming drains your battery three to five times faster than listening to the exact same content on the FM chip. ‘When the power grid is out, the only lifeline for the American public is having an FM tuner.’ In the UK, many cheaper mobile phones come with FM radio activated. Smartphones produced by HTC and Motorola also come with the ability to listen to FM radio. Around 21 per cent of adults in the UK say they have listened to radio using a mobile phone or tablet at least once a month during 2014, but many of these may have been using apps rather than FM chips. In the US the figures are lower as the availability of phones with FM radio activated is lower. Devices such as Apple’s iPhone also contain the technology to allow FM radio listening – they are included on the chip that also receives WiFi and Bluetooth radio signals. In the iPhone 6, for example, the Murata 339S0228 chip has its FM functionality switched off. Devices such as Apple’s iPhone  also contain the technology to allow FM radio listening – they are included on the chip that also receives WiFi and Bluetooth radio signals. In the iPhone 6 (pictured), for example, the Murata 339S0228 chip has its FM functionality switched off . Other smartphones running Android, including some made by Samsung and LG, also suffer from the same problem. However, turning these on is not a simple task. Many of these phones also lack the FM antenna needed to receive a signal. Some phones use the headphone cords as an antenna, but this would need to be connected to the smartphone devices. There is also commercial resistance to activating these FM chips. Mobile service providers are increasingly attempting to attract customers by offering music streaming services, according to a report by US Congressional Research Service. Apple is also preparing to launch its own music streaming service. Other smartphones running Android also suffer from the same problem. Samsung's early models came with FM radio but the firm was criticised for not including it in the Galaxy S4 (pictured) FM is seen by some as an archaic technology that will be replaced with digital radio. Norway has become the first country to announce it will switch off its FM radio service in 2017 and other countries are expected to follow. However, the BBC has been leading a new project to combine internet radio with FM or DAB to produce a hybrid radio service. Called the Universal Smartphone Radio Project, is has been discussing how to develop the technology with smartphone manufacturers. Helen Boaden, director of BBC Radio, said: ‘There is an enduring love for radio and easy listening on the move is critical for this. ‘This UK-led global partnership is a response to listeners’ demand for simple, charge-free radio in mobile phones.’ In the US, 32 mobile devices now carry a NextRadio hybrid radio chip pre-installed. According to Craig Fugate, administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Administration, radio is critical in a crisis. Speaking in a video on the FreeRadioOnMyPhone.org campaign site, he said: ‘As more and more people use their smartphones as streaming devices to get news, get radio, get a lot of things like that over their networks, I don't think people realize how vulnerable they get.’ James Cridland, a radio futurologist, added: ‘There's clear evidence that people love FM radio in their phone. ‘I find it odd that US mobile networks seek to ignore what their consumers want, in favour of forcing them to pay more on data.’ The CTIA-The Wireless Association, however, insists that mobile phone users prefer to stream, download and customize music playlists in a way that FM radio does not allow.","Many smartphones - including Apple's iPhone - come with an FM chip installed but many are not switched on by the manufacturers .

"With just 10 days to go until the general election, Ed Miliband has already won one political battle – as the nation's 'best looking' political leader. First it was the 'milifandom' – with thousands of teenage girls allegedly swooning for the Labour leader on Twitter. But now it seems he's gained another big fan in the form of The Only Way Is Essex star Lydia Bright. The Only Way Is Essex star Lydia Bright met Labour leader Ed Miliband as part of the 'useyourvoice' campaign encouraging young people to vote . The reality TV star said Mr Miliband 'definitely' topped her list of political leaders in a game of 'snog, marry or avoid' The reality TV star said Mr Miliband 'definitely' topped her list of political leaders in a game of 'snog, marry or avoid'. Bright, who interviewed the Labour leader as part of a campaign to encourage youngsters to vote, said she would 'snog or marry Ed because he's the best-looking one out of them all'. She added: 'He had a really great dress sense and looked very dapper. He gets my fashion seal of approval.' It comes after a group of female fans left Westminster watchers baffled after taking to Twitter in droves to reveal their love for the Labour leader. Dubbing themselves the 'Milifans' the mostly teenage girls rallied support for the opposition leader using the Twitter hashtag #milifandom. Bright said she teased the Labour leader over his unlikely sex symbol status. The 24-year-old said: 'I had a bit of a joke with him as well and talked to him about his massive fan base and he seemed very humbled and a bit embarrassed by it. 'But he was also pretty cool about it all. He just really wants those fans tweeting about him to vote for him.' Ed Miliband - arriving at the Arc Arts Centre in Stockton-on-Tees in the North East this morning - has become an unlikely pin up . The Labour leader last week found that he had thousands of 'Milifans' on Twitter - mostly teenage girls - who were rallying support for him and praising his good looks . Bright interviewed the Labour leader as part of the 'useyourvoice' Twitter campaign which encourages young people to vote. She said: 'I wanted to talk to him about what Labour would do about the amount of parents who can't afford to look after their children because those children often end up in care. It's a shocking issue that's really personal to me. 'You'd think all the politicians would be quite posh and a bit pompous but he just seemed really friendly.' Bright's parents have been fostering children since she was 13 months old. Despite consistently voting, Bright admitted she is not a 'political whizz kid', but said she was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to chat to Mr Miliband. But she confessed she still hasn't decided how she will vote as she is determined to do more research and get a better understanding of each party's manifesto 'to get a really clear picture in my mind before I vote on May 7'. The 'useyourvoice' campaign encourages 18 to 30-year-olds to vote in the General Election.","Reality TV star said Mr Miliband 'definitely' topped her list of politicians .

"As our cities get busier parking spaces become harder to come by and it can be difficult to squeeze into a tight spot in rush hour. But German engineers have come up with an innovative solution - a small electric car that can turn on the spot, shrink in size and even move sideways, like a crab, so it can park itself. The EOssc2 is described as an 'ultra flexible micro-car for mega cities' and is designed to connect to others to form a train. Scroll down for videos . Engineers at the DFKI Robotics Centre describe the EOssc2 (animated) as an 'ultra flexible micro-car for mega cities' and plan on enabling it to drive itself. The concept car can turn on the spot, shrink in size and even move sideways, like a crab, so it can park itself . Crabs have a wide flat body to make it easier squeeze into narrow spaces and the EOssc2 works in a similar way. The arthropods flex the second joint of each leg to move sideways, although some crabs can walk forwards as well. In the case of the EOssc2, the car turns its wheels to manoeuvre and mimic this movement. Its unusual design also features a forward tilt and doors that open like the DeLorean in Back to the Future.

'Later, an autopilot will be able to drive the car without a single passenger intervention creating the driverless car,' it added. Currently, the two-seater vehicle can be driven in the traditional way, diagonally and sideways. It can also pivot on the spot and shrink from 8 feet (2.5metres) to 5 feet (1.5metres) while maintaining a comfortable seating position, according to the firm. It does this because its wheels are individually powered by separate motors so they can turn in different directions. The car has a top speed of 40mph (65 km/h) and its semi-autonomous features are possible because of inbuilt cameras and a LIDAR sensor on its roof, which lets the vehicle scan its environment and locate itself in it, 10 times a second. It is designed to link with others to from a kind a connected convoy that can save energy over long distances - such as on motorways or as a car-sharing scheme.

"Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi (illustrated) as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features . A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which includes the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows that a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, as well as honouring Diego Suárez, who discovered the bones. The seven-year-old came across the fossils at the Toqui Formation in southern Chile when he and his sister, Macarena were looking for decorative stones. They were playing at the site because their geologist parents, Manuel Suarez and Rita de la Cruz were studying rocks with the aim to better understand the formation of the Andes mountain range. Experts initially thought Diego had unearthed several species, due to Chilesaurus' unusual combination of features. However, more than a dozen specimens have now been excavated, including four skeletons, which demonstrate that the dinosaur combined a variety of unique anatomical traits. The dinosaur has been likened to a platypus, which is one of the most unusual creatures in the animal kingdom, because it's one of very few mammal to lay eggs, has venomous spurs and a paddle-shaped tail like a beaver, as well as webbed feet and a bill like a duck, among other idiosyncrasies. Most of the specimens discovered are the size of a turkey, but some isolated bones reveal the maximum size of Chilesaurus was around 10 feet (three metres) long, according to Chilean and Argentinian palaeontologists from institutions including the University of Birmingham who have studied the skeletons. Unusual: Fossils dating from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, reveal an unusual combination of features from various dinosaur groups, including relatively short arms, a long neck, small head and leaf-shaped teeth (pictured) Bizarre: Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics including its small skull and feet, which are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The dinosaur itself, has a lengthy neck and must have had good balance (illustrated) Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics. The Late Jurassic dinosaur lived 145 million years ago. It has a small skull and feet, which are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus, but has two blunt fingers instead of sharp claws, like the Velociraptor, for example. Chilesaurus' pelvic girdle resembles that of the ornithischian dinosaurs - beaked, herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs and Iguanadon. It has leaf-shaped teeth, similar to those of primitive long-neck dinosaurs. Most unusually, the animal was a vegetarian, despite belonging the theopod family of dinosaurs, which were mostly fierce meat eaters. The dinosaur ranged in size from as small as a turkey to 10 ft (three metres) long. They discovered that Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus. But its hands have two blunt fingers, instead of sharp claws like its fellow theropod the Velociraptor. Chilesaurus' pelvic girdle resembles that of the ornithischian dinosaurs - beaked, herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs and Iguanadon - whereas it is actually classified in the other basic dinosaur division – Saurischia, according to the study published in the journal Nature. The different parts of the body of Chilesaurus were adapted to a particular diet and way of life, which was similar to other groups of dinosaurs. As a result of these habits, different regions of the body of Chilesaurus evolved resembling those present in other, unrelated groups of dinosaurs - a phenomenon called evolutionary convergence. Chilesaurus represents one of the most extreme cases of evolutionary convergence. For example, its leaf-shaped teeth are similar to those of primitive long-neck dinosaurs because they were selected over millions of years as a result of a similar diet between these two lineages of dinosaurs. 'Chilesaurus can be considered a ""platypus"" dinosaur because different parts of its body resemble those of other dinosaur groups due to mosaic convergent evolution,’ Martín Ezcurra, a researcher at the University of Birmingham explained. Painstaking: Close inspection of the fossils revealed that Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus. But its hands have two blunt fingers, instead of sharp claws like its fellow theropod, the Velociraptor. The process of excavating the skeleton is shown . The presence of herbivorous theropods was, up until now, only known in close relatives of birds but Chilesaurus (illustrated left) shows that a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than thought. Its fossils were found at the Toqui Formation in southern Chile, marked with a red star on the map, right . ‘In this process, a region or regions of an organism resemble others of unrelated species because of a similar mode of life and evolutionary pressures. ‘Chilesaurus provides a good example of how evolution works in deep time and it is one of the most interesting cases of convergent evolution documented in the history of life. 'Chilesaurus shows how much data is still completely unknown about the early diversification of major dinosaur groups.’ He believes that this study will force palaeontologists to take more care in identifying fragmented and isolated dinosaur bones. Dr Fernando Novas, of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires, Argentina, led the research on Chilesaurus. Seven-year-old Diego Suárez (pictured left) came across the fossils when he and his sister, Macarena, were looking for decorative stones. He was at the site while his his geologist parents, Manuel Suarez (pictured right) and Rita de la Cruz were studying rocks with the aim to better understand the formation of the Andes . Experts initially thought Diego had unearthed several species, due to Chilesaurus' unusual combination of features. Here, a palaeontologist painstakingly excavates the fossils . He said: ‘Chilesaurus is the first complete dinosaur from the Jurassic Period found in Chile and represents one of the most complete and anatomically correct documented theropod dinosaurs from the southern hemisphere. ‘Although plant-eating theropods have been recorded in North America and Asia, this is the first time a theropod with this characteristic has been found in a southern landmass. ‘Chilesaurus was an odd plant-eating dinosaur only to be found in Chile. ‘However, the recurrent discovery in beds of the Toqui Formation of its bones and skeletons clearly demonstrates that Chilesaurus was, by far, the most abundant dinosaur in southwest Patagonia 145 million years ago.' The lineage of huge meat-eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over the course of 50 million years. This is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants, mapping the unlikely transformation. The tree showed that the branch of theropod dinosaurs, which gave rise to modern birds, were the only dinosaurs that kept getting smaller. The lineage of huge meat-eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over 50 million years. This is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants, mapping their unlikely transformation . Theropods, meaning ‘beast-footed’, were a group of dinosaurs which include the carnivorous dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. 'These bird ancestors also evolved new adaptations, such as feathers, wishbones and wings, four times faster than other dinosaurs,' said co-author Darren Naish, a palaeontologist at the University of Southampton. Lead author Associate Professor Michael Lee, from the University of Adelaide, said: 'Birds evolved through a unique phase of sustained miniaturisation in dinosaurs.' 'Being smaller and lighter in the land of giants, with rapidly evolving anatomical adaptations, provided these bird ancestors with new ecological opportunities, such as the ability to climb trees, glide and fly. ‘Ultimately, this evolutionary flexibility helped birds survive the deadly meteorite impact which killed off all their dinosaurian cousins.' Researchers examined over 1,500 anatomical traits of dinosaurs to reconstruct their family tree. They used mathematical modelling to trace evolving adaptions and changing body size over time and across dinosaur branches.","Chilesaurus diegosuarezi was discovered by a child in southern Chile .

Febyanti (left) with Chan's brother Michael (right) accepted her now husband's marriage proposal in February . Febyanti immediately accepted his proposal, despite the fact that she knew he was condemned to death by Indonesian president Joko Widodo. Febyanti and Chan met each other in Kerobokan prison in 2012 after a friend introduced the pair. The Indonesian had been visiting the prison as part of her role as a pastor and Chan was carrying out theological studies in the hope of becoming a minister. Since then they have dreamed of his release, even talking about plans to have children together one day. Salvation Army minister and family friend David Soper officiated the wedding. Mr Soper has also been asked by Chan to be his religious adviser in his final hours and witness his execution. Fairfax Media report that when Attorney General H.M. Prasetyo first heard Chan's request to get married, he thought it was a joke.

"She's in rehab now, but the big question remains: What exactly happened at the Polo Lounge at the swank Beverly Hills Hotel that led to Kim Richards' out of control behavior. The real housewife was arrested following an emotional breakdown after a heated exchange with the maître d' at the swanky bar of the Beverly Hills Hotel, Daily Mail Online can reveal. In a downward-spiral, the 50-year-old recovering alcoholic admitted to Dr Phil McGraw that she was drunk on the night of her arrest. Scroll down for exclusive video . Help: Kim Richards is now in a Malibu rehab, but the star was out of control when she was arrested at the Beverly Hills Hotel. She tells all to Dr Phil in a show that will air tomorrow . Pouring her heart out: The reality star admits to Dr Phil that she had a glass of vodka at her daughter Brooke's  house.  'A two inch drink?' Dr Phil asks. Kim answers, 'Oh yeah.' Dr. Phil:  'Was this in a five gallon paint can?' Support system:  Three of Richards' four children,  Chad, 22 and Kimberly, 20, and Brooke, 29, who were there to support their mother . The night ended with police officers dragging the kicking and screaming reality star out of a bathroom cubicle when she refused to come out because she was 'angry and frightened'. The explosive account of what happened on the night of April 16 has emerged in an emotional interview Richards has given to Dr Phil that will air tomorrow. The Daily Mail Online has learned exclusive details from the session during which Richards – who has battled with alcoholism for years – told how she dramatically fell off the wagon. Dr Phil: If you’re an alcoholic that has fallen off the wagon, you’re at your daughter’s house and all of a sudden you’re in there pouring a drink, and then you roll into a bar at midnight, what, you’re already drunk when you get there, why, why would you not order a drink? Kim: Because… . Dr Phil: Why would you go to a bar if you’re not going to order a drink? Why not go to a pancake house….you could have gone to IHOP?! Kim: Because I went there, because I was feeling the drink, and I didn’t want to drive anymore. and I pulled in so I wouldn’t be on the road. And I pulled in there because that’s a safe place for me. Dr Phil: You went to a bar! Kim: That’s where I usually go. And I've been going there for years. Dr Phil: You could have got a room, you could have gone into the lobby. Kim: I was just gonna sit down for a few minutes and just— . Dr Phil: In a bar! She says she pulled in to the Beverly Hills Hotel because she felt the glass of vodka she drank at her daughter Brooke's house kick in. She knew she would be comfortable at the hotel. He ex-in laws (she was married to Gregg Davis, son of mogul Marvin Davis) owned the hotel and she's been going there since she was a little girl. But soon after arriving at the famed hotel, Richards was asked to leave by the maître d' at The Polo Lounge after he claimed the wobbly Real Housewife began harassing two strangers at the bar. She had earlier been asked to return to her own table after approaching the couple, but when she refused, a furious row erupted and hotel security was called. The night ended with Richards' well publicized arrest. The former child star turned Real Housewife claims she drove to the Beverly Hills Hotel at midnight on April 16 after drinking a large glass of vodka. Richards says she pulled into the hotel on her way home because she saw it as a 'comfortable, familiar' place and felt the alcohol taking affect. Astonishingly, the mom-of-four insists she didn't head straight to the hotel bar with the intention of buying more alcohol. She told Dr. Phil she pulled into the hotel because she felt the alcohol was unexpectedly hitting her. Before entering the hotel she sat in the driveway for a while and cried. She went into the Polo Lounge and headed to a table in the corner where she always sits. There were some people at the table and she walked over and began chatting with them when the maître d' - who she says she didn't know - asked her to return to her own table. Richards said she didn't because the woman she was talking to said she could stay. Kim: I started to drive home, and it was about when I hit the hotel, that I started to feel it. So I pulled in because I'm comfortable there, I've been going there since I'm a little girl…. Dr. Phil: Did you order a drink when you got there? Kim: I did not. The bar was closed. It was empty.  I do know that when he mentioned the word trespassing. Dr. Phil: Who said trespassing to you? Kim: The waiter. He said you know, 'If you don't leave we're going to call the police for trespassing.' Dr. Phil: All of this is because you poured yourself. You said – . Kim: Oh no, it was a good size. Dr. Phil: A two inch drink? Kim: Oh yeah. Dr. Phil: Was this in a five gallon paint can? What? Kim: No. It was just in a glass. Dr. Phil: Let's talk about the common sensibility of your story. Let's assume this is somebody else. Okay and I leave and I'm starting to feel it so I swing into the Beverly Hills Hotel and I go into the Polo and I'm obviously impaired cause there's somebody over there that I don't know from Adam but I think I do. Kim: Right. Dr. Phil: And I go over to their table and start talking to them and I'm just chatting them up but it's enough that the maitre d' in a bar, which is a social scene comes over and says – . Kim: When people drink – . Dr. Phil: 'You need to go back over to your table here because…' Kim: Right. Dr. Phil: But then it gets to the point that he comes back and says, 'No you're trespassing. You need to not only go back to your table, you need to leave this establishment.' Kim: Right. Dr. Phil: Were you loud, were you obnoxious, were you crazy? Admitting that the night was a little foggy, Richards said she went to talk to the stranger because she thought she knew her. She claims she did not have a drink at the hotel as the bar was shut but admitted she didn't remember much. But when the maître d' told her if she didn't leave he was going to call the police for trespassing she got bent out of shape. Since she first appeared on the hit reality show in 2010, Richards' sobriety has been her major storyline, with her recent relapse as the driving force between Kim and sister Kyle's distant relationship. Tarnished star: Kim Richards leaving the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, where she had an emotionally-charged interview with Dr Phil McGraw . Her sister Kathy Hilton is seen behind . Scene of the Crime:  Kim pulled into the hotel because she was feeling the effects of the glass of vodka she drank. Last week we revealed how embattled Richards stormed out of the Dr Phil interview, broke down in tears and went into full meltdown. Observers revealed she bolted from the room where Dr Phil had offered to help place her in a top treatment program. But Richards apparently snubbed Dr Phil's offer of help as eyewitnesses in the hallway heard her scream 'F***', and other obscenities when she ran out of the room and down the hall. TMZ reported that Kim entered a Malibu rehab facility over the weekend. Dr Phil's interview with Richards is set to air tomorrow,  April 28, her first for a national audience since the arrest.","Kim Richards, who will tell her story to Dr. Phil tomorrow,  is now in a Malibu rehab facility .

Guests heard a disturbance between a man and a woman, who were visiting the city from the US naval ship USS Carl Vinson, at about 1am on Monday before the man leapt. Police say the pair were both heavily intoxicated when an argument escalated, which led the man to jump off the balcony where he landed in an estimate 1.3 metres of water.

"Teenage girls do better in single sex schools as they can focus on their work rather than impressing boys, a leading headmistress says. Rhiannon Wilkinson, head of Wycombe Abbey in Buckinghamshire reportedly said that a 'boy free' environment stops girls from being held back by the opposite sex, who are known to mature slower. She also suggested that single-sex boarding schools give pupils relief and protection from the 'highly sexualised world' and allow them to 'remain girls for longer.' 'My wide educational experience in both mixed and girls' schools has shown me clearly that girls are best served educationally in their teenage years in a boy-free work environment,' she said according to the Telegraph. Rhiannon Wilkinson, the head of Wycombe Abbey in Buckinghamshire, pictured, claims a 'boy free' environment allows teenage girls to focus on their work . She added: 'In co-ed environments lots of girls when adolescence kicks want to be liked by boys not just for their intelligence and want to be popular with boys. But she said in all girl environments pupils are 'free from that,' according to the Telegraph. Two years ago Scientists at Newcastle University found that girls really do mature faster than boys. They discovered that as the brain matures it begins to 'prune' information that is stored and focus on what is important. Tony Little, head at Eton College, has previously said that single sex schools allow children to retain their 'innocence' For girls this can happen as early as 10 years old, but for boys it can take until between 15 and 20 for the same. Tony Little, the head of Eton College, has also spoken of the benefits of single sex schools. He said they allow children to retain their 'innocence' and be 'themselves' for longer. 'What does strike me is that in a single-sex environment, particularly at the age of 13, 14, 15, there is an opportunity for both boys and girls to be themselves for longer. To be 'boyish' for longer, to be young girls,' he said, according to the BBC. Boys could also benefit from being taught separately. Statistics have shown that boys often lag behind girls at both GCSE and A-level and are much less likely to apply to university. Alun Jones, the first male president of the Girls' Schools Association, has previously called for teenage boys  to be taught in single sex classes in state schools. Mr Jones, who is also a schools inspector, said: 'If you have a very bright, very driven, very focused, very articulate lady, which a lot of girls are, that intimidates a boy in the classroom, especially boys of average ability. 'The result is that boys don't put their hands up to answer questions or they indulge in immature behaviour to avoid being shown up. Boys are falling behind as girls are doing better.'","'Boy free' environment stops girls from being held back by opposite sex .

"The girlfriend of a Google engineer who died in the deadly avalanche on Mount Everest described him as a magical person whose purpose in life was to constantly challenge himself. Ashley Arenson said boyfriend Dan Fredinburg, 33, had a way of making people around him feel special and urged them to accomplish everything they wanted. The Arkansas-native is one of four Americans confirmed to have died when an earthquake hit Nepal on Saturday, causing a tsunami of snow and ice to engulf the base camp. Ashley Arenson (left) said boyfriend Dan Fredinburg, 33, had a way of making people around him feel special and urged them to accomplish everything they wanted. He was one of the four American citizens to die at Mount Everest during the deadly avalanche on Saturday . Arenson revealed that the Google engineer and Arkansas-native wanted to return to Mount Everest following the devastation of the avalanche last year - when 16 people were killed . After hearing the news of his death. Arenson posted an image of Fridenburg wearing a white t-shirt on Instagram alongside the message: Modern day superman. This photo was taken at The Laundry, SF during construction in September. 'Pure joy overcame @danfredinburg as he showed me one of the ways he is going to change the world.' Speaking to CNN, Arenson said: 'He's brought out the best version in me. He would constantly make you want to be the best person you can. 'All of his choices were to help him become happy. 'He had this way of making the people around him just feel special without even trying, and make people feel like they could accomplish anything they wanted,' she added. She revealed that he wanted to return to Mount Everest following the devastation of the avalanche last year - when 16 people were killed. The Arkansas School of Math graduate had planned to attempt to reach the summit, when his trip was cancelled. He had been travelling to the Himalayas frequently as part of the Google Adventures team, who were mapping out extreme routes around the world. 'I don't think Dan would want people to do just one thing. He would want them to constantly challenge themselves,' Arenson said. 'What Dan would want is for every single person out there to live life to the fullest and live in the moment because that's what he did. That's how he lived his life.' Arenson sat alongside one of Fredinburg's closest friends Michael North. The couple often went on adventures together and would share their experiences on Instagram. Arenson said Fredinnburg brought out the best in her . On this social media post four months ago, Arenson said she couldn't wait to be reunited with her 'partner in crime'. The pair met again before he set off to Everest for the expedition . The pair were wearing yellow scarves, which are given during a Nepalese ceremony to ensure  safe passage over the mountain. He said: 'We would say Dan had this ability to create a reality-distortion field. That he had so much power, he could change reality ... He would make the world just such a happy, vibrant place to be.' North also started a company with Fredinburg called Save the Ice, a group which travels the world to document climate change hotspots. They released a statement following his death saying: 'Save the Ice mourns the loss of our co-founder Dan Fredinburg, who perished during this morning's avalanche while climbing Mt. Everest for our ""Expedition Everest"" campaign. We have lost a great friend, inspiring adventurer, and, above all, a warrior for the planet.' His friends have since uploaded a Crowdrise page in Fredinburg's memory, with all the funds going to relief efforts and an orphanage he was involved in. More than $38,000 has been raised so far. Fredinburg started at Google in 2007. Beforehand he graduated from the Arkansas School of Math, Science and Art in Hot Springs in 1999, before moving on with his career. He started at the technology company as product manager and then head of privacy at Google X, the company's secretive arm best known for 'moonshot' projects such as the self-driving car.

Arenson posted an image of Fredinburg wearing a white t-shirt on Instagram alongside a message which began: 'Modern day superman' Before Dan Fredinburg left for his Everest expedition, his girlfriend gave him a bundle of letters he could only open when he reached the summit. It is not known whether he got a chance to read them. Close friend Max Stossel posted a picture of the message he wrote to his late friend on Facebook on Saturday alongside a tribute. Part of it read: 'Your story has already greatly impacted mine for the better. With each adventure you return with stories that most people wouldn't dream of experiencing themselves. 'Thank you for pushing the human race to be greater, more daring, and to truly live life rather than survive it.'

"He rarely ever publicly criticizes his successor, Barack Obama. But on Saturday night, George W. Bush apparently lashed out at the President's foreign policy. Speaking at a closed-door meeting with Jewish donors in Las Vegas,  the 68-year-old former leader suggested that Obama's plan to lift sanctions on Iran was not plausible - and comes too early. He noted that the country's government and President Hassan Rouhani appear to be caving in - and implied that America could lose leverage if it relaxes sanctions on Tehran anytime soon. And he said that the comprehensive nuclear deal - which is currently being negotiated by six global powers, including the US - would likely have a negative impact on US national security in the future. Scroll down for video . Rare remarks: Speaking at a  meeting with Jewish donors in Las Vegas, George W Bush (pictured) suggested that President Barack Obama's plan to lift sanctions on Iran was not plausible - and comes too early . 'You think the Middle East is chaotic now? Imagine what it looks like for our grandchildren. That’s how Americans should view the deal,' Bush told donors at the Republican Jewish Coalition session. Bush's concerns are in stark contrast to Obama's belief that although the contents of the agreement - which were announced at the start of April - 'may not be optimal,' they are America's 'best bet'. In an interview with the New York Times, Obama remarked: 'This is our best bet by far to make sure Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon.' But he noted the deal could see 'real political difficulties'. Bush's administration initially began the diplomatic effort to confront the Iranian regime about its nuclear program. He also made attempts early in his administration to negotiate with North Korea. During his comments on Saturday, transcribed by an attendee at the event at the Venetian Hotel and obtained by Bloomberg, the former president told donors that he would not criticize Obama. He congratulated his successor on his ambition to degrade and destroy the Islamic State, which has taken over large swathes of Iraq and Syria and beheaded US journalists on video last year. Leaders: Bush, who rarely ever publicly criticizes Obama, noted that the Iranian government and President Hassan Rouhani appear to be caving in. Above, Bush, left, greets Obama in Selma, Alabama, in March . Terror group: Bush initially congratulated his successor on his aim to degrade and destroy the Islamic State. But he went on to imply that Obama has failed to keep his promises and is losing the war against the group . But he then went on to suggest that Obama had failed to follow through on his promises, saying that one of the key issues was that the Democrat did not develop a military strategy to defeat the terror group. 'In order to be an effective president ... when you say something you have to mean it,' he said, according to Bloomberg, implying that Obama is losing the war against ISIS. 'You gotta kill em.' Bush even reportedly touted his own success in capturing Islamic terrorist Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who murdered Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl and countless others. In relation to Obama's decision to withdraw all American troops from Iraq in 2011, Bush cited Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who has publicly criticized the President's foreign policy. He quoted him as saying: 'Pulling out of Iraq was a strategic blunder,' according to theNew York Times, which collected accounts of Bush's comments from around 12 people at the session. A dangerous last name? Bush apparently remarked that his brother, presidential candidate Jeb Bush (above) could encounter struggles in his campaign due to his last name because Americans do not like dynasties . Bush's comments followed an interview with CBS News last November in which he suggested that the draw down of troops in the war-torn country had allowed ISIS to flourish and recruit more militants. Speaking to news station in a two-part interview, the politician said he thought it was 'the right decision' to take military action in 2003 in a bid to oust Saddam Hussein. But he added: 'My regret is that…a violent group of people have risen up again…This is ""Al-Qaeda plus""…they need to be defeated. And I hope we do…I hope the strategy works.' During Saturday's question-and-answer session, Bush also told anecdotes about his old friend, Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he said had once told him that his dog was 'bigger, stronger and faster' than Bush's own. Bush considered the  comparison to show Putin did not think in 'win-win' terms, he said. He also apparently remarked that his  brother, presidential candidate Jeb Bush, could encounter struggles in his campaign due to his last name because Americans do not like dynasties. And he called Hillary Rodham Clinton 'formidable', but beatable, the Times reported. The session was attended by Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, who owns the Venetian hotel. It comes as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in New York on Monday, according to a senior State Department official. Kerry, who will be participating in a nuclear non-proliferation conference that opens at the United Nations on Monday, will also apparently meet with Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh. And he will spend time with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, the official said.","Bush, 68, implied Obama's plan to lift sanctions on Iran comes too early .

"Isa Richardson, a well-known beggar in Maidstone, Kent, made a 12-year-old hand over her last 15p . A beggar has been ordered to pay £20 to a 12-year-old girl after intimidating her into handing over the last 15p of her pocket money. The frightened youngster was confronted by homeless Isa Richardson who claimed she needed money because her car had broken down, a court heard. The schoolgirl, who has not been named, told police she felt intimidated by Richardson, 46, and believed she had no choice but to hand over the money. Richardson is a well-known character in Maidstone, Kent, who has a history of begging and a number of outstanding fines for other offences. She admitted her latest offence when she appeared before magistrates in Maidstone. The court ordered her to pay £20 to the young victim because of the stress she was forced to endure in the  incident. Richardson was caught and arrested on March 19 after CCTV operators were alerted to her suspicious behaviour as they spotted her approaching people for cash. She told the court she was in such a desperate financial situation that she believed her only options were to either beg or shoplift. She also told the court she deeply regretted upsetting the youngster. Magistrates heard she owed £375 in outstanding fines and costs from previous crimes but had started receiving benefits and was looking for a job to start paying off the debt. Homeless Richardson was also given a 12-month conditional discharge. Debbie Jones, prosecuting, said she had already been convicted of similar offences twice this year. A spokesman for Maidstone Borough Council said: 'We cannot comment on specific cases. 'Begging is illegal and anyone who feels intimidated should call the police on 101 or speak to a Police Community Support Officer.'

"Nigel Farage has proclaimed that he will 'smash apart' Labour's 'one-party state' in the North at the election. The Ukip leader said that his party is now the 'serious challenger' to Labour in northern seats. He accused the party of making claims Ukip is racist because it is 'running scared'.‎ . Mr Farage called on Conservative supporters to vote tactically to help Ukip beat Labour in its target seats. Scroll down for video . Up for it: The Ukip leader said that his party is now the 'serious challenger' to Labour in northern seats . He said that traditional Labour voters also want to send a message to Ed Miliband, 'you don't represent us anymore'. In an article for MailOnline, he wrote: 'The truth is, Labour are running scared, and it's not the Conservative Party making great inroads into their vote. It's us. It's UKIP. 'You only have to look at last year's Heywood and Middleton by-election for proof of it. 'We came within 620 votes of taking a ""safe"" Labour seat, and actually, Mr Miliband would have had to resign as leader of his party if we had done it. The problem in that case was that the Conservative Party split the vote.' Mr Farage accused Labour of 'sneering' at people who raised issues about immigration and claimed Ukip has now 'emerged as the party of the working man'. He added: 'Across the North of England, UKIP are now the serious challengers to Labour.' Mr Farage accused Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna of making 'tired and old claims' after he said at the weekend that Ukip is infected with the 'virus of racism'. He wrote: 'While most people pay no heed when they hear these claims nowadays, it is interesting to think about why Labour chiefs are attacking UKIP, when they really should be focusing on Mr Cameron's Conservatives by this point in the campaign.' Mr Farage will on Tuesday campaign in Hartlepool, where he thinks the party has its best chance of winning in the North East at the election. The seat has been put on Ukip's list of top ten targets. Other seats outside of the south of England on the list are Great Grimsby, Boston & Skegness, Dudley North and Heywood & Middleton. Proud: Ukip's strategists believe the party could come second in at least 100 seats in the North . However, the party suffered a blow on Monday when a poll by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft showed the party was 17 points behind Labour in Great Grimsby. Ukip's strategists believe the party could come second in at least 100 seats in the North. In 2010 the party failed to achieve even a single second place. The Hartlepool constituency has been held by Labour since it was formed in 1974. In 2010, Ukip took just seven per cent of the vote and Labour's Iain Wright retained the seat with a 5,509 majority. He replaced Peter Mandelson as the MP in a by-election in 2004 after the Labour grandee stood down to become a European Commissioner. Mr Farage's hopes for electoral victory in Hartlepool come after the town elected a man dressed as a monkey as its mayor in 2002. Stuart Drummond stood as 'H'Angus the Monkey', Hartlepool United FC's mascot, as a publicity stunt with the slogan, 'free bananas for schoolchildren'. He was re-elected in 2005 and 2009 before voters in the town backed a referendum to scrap the paid post in 2012. Hartlepool's residents are famously said to have hanged a monkey during the Napoleonic wars because they thought it was a French spy. ‎Have you noticed how in the past few days Labour has started to attack me and Ukip, just as the polls suggest that more and more Labour voters are going to be voting for us on May 7th? Polls have shown a sharply rising proportion of Ukip supporters drawn from people who voted Labour in 2010. On April 17th it was seven per cent. This weekend it jumped to 19 percent. Labour's Chuka Umunna has again repeated a tired old claim about Ukip and race. Worried: Mr Farage said Labour are 'running scared' of his United Kingdom Independence Party . While most people pay no heed when they hear these claims nowadays, it is interesting to think about why Labour chiefs are attacking Ukip, when they really should be focusing on Mr Cameron's Conservatives by this point in the campaign. The truth is, Labour are running scared, and it's not the Conservative Party making great inroads into their vote. It's us. It's Ukip. You only have to look at last year's Heywood and Middleton by-election for proof of it. We came within 620 votes of taking a 'safe' Labour seat, and actually, Mr Miliband would have had to resign as leader of his party if we had done it. The problem in that case was that the Conservative Party split the vote, and we hadn't yet proclaimed our Australian-style points system plan for immigration, or our plans to take those on the minimum wage out of income tax completely. Sneering: Mr Farage said Chuka Umunna continued to 'sneer' at his party on immigration and attacked a 'whopping majority of Britons' And far from the party of old, gin-soaked half colonels that some would like Ukip to be, we have emerged as the party of the working man and woman of this country, with a health policy welcomed by the Alzheimer's Society, a housing policy endorsed by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, and an immigration policy that 77 per cent of the British public agree with. But Mr Umunna and the London Labourites continue to sneer at people over the issues they want answers on. When they attack me, they're really attacking a whopping majority of Britons who know that on defence, our NHS, jobs, and the economy, Labour has proved itself to be grossly negligent. On immigration, Labour was wilfully deceitful, as several senior party sources now admit. They wanted to change our communities for political gain. They simply do not understand the impact that mass migration has had on people's lives. In doing what they did, they betrayed their core voters – keeping wages down, making it harder to get a GP appointment, and creating a shortage of school places. People rely on government to help them with some of their most basic needs, and Labour has not just failed to provide them, it has actually reduced their availability. Look at the mess Ed Miliband's party is in as a result of all this. Across the North of England, Ukip are now the serious challengers to Labour. In Scotland, Labour's heading for a wipeout. People are mustering up the courage to depart from their 'traditional' way of voting. They want to send Labour a message: 'You don't represent us anymore'. That's because in areas like Rotherham, Hartlepool, and Stockton, Labour has ceased trying to represent the values, beliefs and opinions of ordinary folk. They're more concerned with the chattering classes of Westminster and Islington. And let's face it, until a few years ago there wasn't much choice in the North. The Conservative Party's entire campaign is based on the idea that he economy is enriching people's lives, but very few people in the North of England are feeling that. And their claims expose the fact that they don't know how much people are still struggling. But now there's a challenger in the North. It's Ukip. So expect, over the next few days, a panicked campaign by Ed Miliband and chums during which they'll call us names, hurl abuse, and try and scare voters away from us. Don't believe them. Instead, trust in your judgement, and help us smash apart Labour's one party state in the North. Ukip has several target seats in the North of England, which I now believe we're in with a chance of winning.‎ .","Farage accused Labour of claiming Ukip is racist as it is 'running scared'

"Karen Bell, 42, from Hull, has been jailed for 12 months after blackmailing a man for £55 and threatening to post videos of their sex trysts online . A mother who blackmailed a lover she met on dating website Plenty of Fish by threatening to post footage online of their sex sessions if she did not receive £55, has been jailed for 12 months. Karen Bell, 42, from Hull, East Yorkshire, met the man on the dating website and the pair exchanged flirty texts - before meeting up to act out their fantasy in which she spanked him with a pair of trainers. However, Hull Crown Court heard that after their meeting she contacted the man – who cannot be named for legal reasons – and threatened to post the footage on Facebook unless he paid her £25. She later increased the demands, claiming her son had secretly filmed their tryst and the footage was ready to publish, until she received £55. Bell has now been jailed for 12 months after pleading guilty to blackmail. The court heard that the pair began chatting after meeting on free dating site Plenty of Fish and arranged to meet. The man, who was referred to in court as 'Mr A', began lending Bell money as she claimed she was short of cash. Stephen Welch, prosecuting, said: 'Some time in December last year, the complainant and the defendant engaged in sexual activity at the defendant's home address. 'The nature of it was that the complainant removed his trousers and pants and lay on his stomach while the defendant remained fully clothed. 'She spanked the victim on the bottom with a hand, then with a training shoe. 'This was some sort of sexual fantasy the two discussed before the act took place. 'A while later the defendant contacted the complainant and told him her son had installed a hidden camera and their role play had been recorded.' The couple met on free dating website Plenty Of Fish (pictured) and met up after starting up a conversation . Bell, a mother, was jailed for 12 months at Hull Crown Court (pictured) after pleading guilty to blackmail . Bell sent Mr A more messages informing him the recording had been put on a DVD and that she was 'sitting watching it with her son', the court heard. She told him that if he did not want his friends and family to see the film he should pay her and initially demanded £25. The court heard he was worried and Bell told him if he stopped paying her she would publish the DVD on local websites and on Facebook. Bell (pictured) pleaded guilty to blackmail last week . Mr Welch added: 'He was frightened. He believed the defendant would carry out those threats and didn't want his family or friends to see the footage.' Although he had willingly given her some money, he eventually reported Bell to the police and the total amount she gained by the blackmail was £55, the court was told. When Bell was arrested, she told police in an interview that she 'didn't find the victim sexually attractive but they got on well as friends.' Stephen Robinson, mitigating before Judge Paul Watson QC, said: 'The defendant moved to Hull from the Grimsby area in order to better herself and start a new life - getting into this sort of serious trouble was the last thing she expected to happen. 'She was lonely and met the complainant through a dating website and began communicating with him. 'Your honour, unfortunately it culminated in this particular offence.' Jailing Bell for 12 months, Judge Watson told her: 'The money you were demanding was not the highest amount - just £55 - but for him that was significant. 'Blackmail is so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified.'","Karen Bell met victim - who cannot be named - on dating site Plenty of Fish .

"A heartbroken pensioner is believed to have killed himself six days after his wife's death by jumping from a bridge at their 'special place' where they used to take romantic walks together. John Lord, 86, went missing from his home on April 6 less than a week after his beloved wife June, 81, died from a 'catastrophic bleed' to the brain. His family feared the worst after discovering a note describing how much he missed his wife of 63 years and how he could not live without her. Double tragedy: John Lord, 86, went missing from his home on April 6 less than a week after his beloved wife June, 81, pictured together on their wedding anniversary, died from a 'catastrophic bleed' to the brain . Nottinghamshire Police launched an appeal in a bid to track down the grandfather-of-three on the day he disappeared from his home in St Ann's, Nottingham. Today officers confirmed a body pulled from the River Trent on April 15 by a specialist underwater search unit was sadly that of the missing pensioner. His family believe he may have killed himself at the picturesque beauty spot where the devoted couple enjoyed going for a walk. Message: Mr Lord's daughter Alison said her father was grieving and had left a heartbreaking note signed 'love to all' and described how he could not live without his wife . Mr Lord's last known moments were also captured on CCTV as he parked his white Toyota Yaris car near close to the Trent at 3.15am on April 6. The footage then shows the pensioner walking toward a bridge, which was the last sighting of him. His daughter, Alison Lord, 56, said her father was grieving and had left a heartbreaking note signed 'love to all.' Speaking before his death, the teaching assistant, who lives in Bulwell, Nottingham, added: 'He did leave a note. 'It said he couldn't live without June, and he apologised and said ""love to all"". 'It was completely out of character for him to get up and drive his car in the middle of the night.' Ms Lord said her parents, who were members of a local church, had been 'inseparable' and her mum's death had left the whole family devastated. A Nottinghamshire Police spokesperson said: 'The body of a man found in the River Trent on April 15, 2015, has been confirmed as that of missing John Lord. 'Mr Lord, 86, went missing from his home in St Ann's on Monday, 6 April. 'His body was recovered at around 11am on April 15 by Nottinghamshire Police's Underwater Search Unit. 'Nottinghamshire Police would like to thank everyone who assisted in the search for Mr Lord by sharing our appeals. 'Mr Lord's family will continue to be supported and have asked for their privacy to be respected. 'The thoughts of Nottinghamshire Police are with the family at this difficult time.' June tragically died on March 31, eight hours after collapsing suddenly from what doctors at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham described as a 'catastrophic bleed' to the brain.

"A grandmother nicknamed the 'Fairy Dogmother' spends more than £28,000 a year looking after the stray or abandoned dogs she has welcomed into her home. For more than 30 years, Pat Senior, 66,  has shared her five-bedroom home in Bolton, Greater Manchester, with the animals, taking in dogs from as far afield as Romania and Hungary. She estimates that she spends £240 a week on food and treats for the dogs, with veterinary bills adding another £17,000 to the yearly cost of caring for the pets. Pat Senior, 66,  (pictured) who is nicknamed the 'Fairy Dogmother', spends more than £28,000 a year looking after as many as 26 stray or abandoned dogs she has welcomed into her home . Grandmother-of-four Mrs Senior and her businessman husband, Charles, currently have 19 dogs in their care, including lurchers, German Shepherds and Chinese Cresteds who all sleep and live at her home. She has made makeshift beds for the animals in the couple's garage, with some dogs sleeping in the living room, although three Chinese Cresteds are allowed to sleep in her bed. She takes in neglected greyhounds as well as adopting dogs from pounds, and at one stage had 26 dogs living under her roof. Mrs Senior spends £240 a week on food and treats for the dogs, with veterinary bills adding another £17,000 to the yearly cost of caring for the pets . As well as taking in neglected greyhounds, Mrs Senior also adopts dogs from her local dog pounds and at one stage had 26 dogs living under her roof. She describes meal times as 'chaotic', with her shopping list consisting of 40 small chickens a week for the smaller and medium sized dogs, and two large packs of minced chicken and pasta a day for the larger animals. 'I wake at 6.30am and it's nonstop from then on,' said Mrs Senior. 'We feed the dogs at dinner time and then they get a big dinner in the evening. It's a mad rush and chaotic with dog bowls all over the place and we make sure every dog gets its dinner. They are here there and everywhere. I also take the only four fit enough to walk out. I also clean.' Mrs Senior, who is also a painter, left behind her career as a singer to look after the animals after a chance encounter with a woman trying to rehome a stray lurcher, Lexus, in 1981. Within a few weeks she became inundated with calls from greyhound owners wanting her to take the dogs off their hands and so set up the Angels With Furry Coats dog rescue, which is run entirely from her home. She says was then asked to work undercover for a BBC documentary to 'expose the dark side of grey hound racing,' and was horrified to see greyhounds drugged with heroine and living in squalor. She then made it her mission to open her home to as many neglected dogs as she could, and last year had eight stray hounds brought over from Romania and Hungary at a cost of £350 per animal. Due to the poor condition of many of her dogs her veterinary bill amounts to around £17,000 a year. 'I have been told I am completely mad and I could have brought many properties with all that money but I would rather be me than someone doing nothing,' she said. 'Somebody has got to look after these dogs and not everyone can. They like holidays and an easy life. Mrs Senior and one of her Angels With Furry Coats volunteers, Lorraine, walk some of the rescued dogs . As well as taking in neglected greyhounds, the grandmother-of-four also adopts dogs from her local dog pounds and at one stage had 26 dogs living under her roof . 'People were calling and saying if you don't take the dog I will kill it. I decided this is what I am going to do for the rest of my life. 'I had no idea what was happening before. I had to deal with owners who would regularly give the dogs heroine. They would have all these dogs hopped up on drugs and off their heads. I was really disgusted. I saw a picture of some hanging by their necks from trees.' 'If I think about it I could have had a pretty good lifestyle if I hadn't spent all this money on the dogs. But I do it because you see these sad cases and when you manage to turn it around it is so worth it.' Mrs Senior, who is also a painter, left behind her career as a singer to look after the animals after a chance encounter with a woman trying to rehome a stray lurcher, Lexus, in 1981 . The mother-of-two says she is rushed off her feet all day, especially as she likes 'to live in a nice house and not a kennel.' She added: 'I have a lovely home and everything has to be spotless. People are gobsmacked that we have a beautiful house. We do not live in a dog kennel.' Many of the dogs that come into Mrs Senior's care are in bad condition and she says she loves getting them back in shape. 'Many of them are flea bitten or emaciated,' she said. 'But some have been garrotted, had fat poured all over them, burnt with cigarettes and some have even be sexually abused. But it is an amazing feeling with you get them better and their eyes light up.'","Pat Senior runs rescue centre from her home in Bolton, Great Manchester .

"It's a classic Australian saying: 'G'day mate, how you going?'. But when one Australian traveller tried to get American's to repeat it, many were lost for words. Kieran Murray, from Brisbane in Queensland, recently spent months travelling across the US, and documented his interactions with locals all around the country. From a homeless man who was insistent upon telling his story about Britney Spears, to a man who insisted Murray was saying 'Get out of my nightgown', the filmmaker captured it all. Scroll down for video . Aussie filmmaker Kieran Murray has released the second installment of his hilarious series which asks Americans to attempt the Australian accent by saying 'G'day mate, how you going? One man in Austin, Texas (far right) was convinced Murray said 'Get out (of) my nightgown' This is the latest in a series of videos Murray put together one of which is based around the same topic, and another of which asks people to guess what common Australian expressions mean. 'I don't even know what he said!' exclaimed one Texan when asked by the Brisbane man to repeat the phrase. 'Say it again in English?', asked a man in Manhattan, New York. 'Sounds Chinese to me man,' he later added. Many people threw strange sideways glances at the man, trying to understand what he was saying, with one man declaring 'that's Spanish!'. Others erupted into fits of laughter as they tried to translate the classic Australian vernacular, and Murray also ran into one very talkative man intent on repeating he used to live in the back of Britney Spears' dads house. This New Yorker said 'sounds Chinese to me man', when speaking to the Brisbane man . One man in Nashville responded with an incomprehensible sentence while trying his hand at the Aussie accent . This man, who didn't quite get the gist of the question, was insistent on telling a story about Britney Spears . 'I lived in the back, of Britney Spears' dads house', the man, who appears to be homeless, told the filmaker over and over again. When he was asked again to repeat the phrase after Murray, he simply said: 'All right'. While on the subway Murray asked one man to repeat what he said, but he simply declared 'Can't do it'. 'I don't know what you said, were those words?' one woman, who appeared to be at a sporting event, asked the Australian. 'What the hell'd you say?' exclaimed one hog hunter in Texas. Kids giggled as they tried to understand what Murray was saying in his Australian accent . Many times the filmmaker was met with strange glances from confused Americans . Children weren't much better and translating the popular Aussie phrase, but the best of the bunch came from a shirtless man in Austin, Texas. 'Wait I got this,' the man said while surrounded by his friends before triumphantly proclaiming: 'Get out my nightgown!'. 'That's the one. Get out my nightgown. I got it right, I already know I got it,' the man said. Murray even managed to stump a speech therapist who struggled to understand the Australian accent. The video, aptly titled 'G'day Mate: The Sequel' can be viewed in full on Murray's YouTube page.","Kieran Murray asked Americans to repeat 'G'day mate, how you going?'

"Recent weeks might have suggested an early summer, but Britain is now in for a reality check as ice, rain and snow arrive with -5C (23F) temperatures. The colder weather is set to last the first half of May - and the forecast comes less than a fortnight after the mercury breached the 25C (77F) mark. Conditions this week are set to be average for April, with showers on the way and temperatures barely in double figures for most of the country. Sleet and snow are forecast for today and tomorrow from the Pennines northwards, and there were small accumulations yesterday in the Cairngorms. Meanwhile the Met Office has a severe yellow ‘be aware’ ice warning for north-east Scotland, warning motorists of a disruption risk until 7am today. Scroll down for video .

Forecast: Conditions this week are set to be average for April, with showers and temperatures barely in double figures for most of the UK . It comes after Britain enjoyed what appeared to be one of the warmest Aprils on record, with a 2014 high of 25.1C (77.2F) recorded in Kent on April 15. And Pershore in Worcestershire had the UK's top temperature of 14.8C (58.6F) yesterday, while Morecambe saw 14.1 hours of sunshine. But the dramatic change is being brought in by a ‘polar plume’ - a cold mass of air moving down from polar regions. Met Office meteorologist Charlie Powell told MailOnline last night: ‘It will feel cooler - temperatures are going to be around average. ‘But because we have been used to things being so warm in recent weeks, we are going to notice the change.’ More than 38,000 marathon runners in London yesterday were caught on the brink of the cold front, as cloudy, damp weather greeted them at the start.

Warmer days: People enjoy the warm weather at Jubilee Gardens next to the London Eye in the centre of the capital on Saturday, April 18 . The mercury is expected to fall as low as -2C (28F) early this morning in built-up areas, while rural parts could see -5C (23F), this week’s expected low. This morning will see a frost, Mr Powell said, and showers are expected to arrive from the west today, with eastern parts forecast to be the driest. And today Britain is even expected to be colder than the Norwegian capital Oslo, which will reach around 13C (55F). Temperatures will be around 12C (54F) for most, although the far South East could see up to 15C (59F) - but that will come with a few showers late on. Tomorrow and Wednesday will also be showery days, with overnight temperatures around freezing and highs of 14C (57F) in the daytime. A similar high could be seen on Thursday and Friday, but there is expected to be more sunshine, fewer showers and lighter winds by this point. Conditions will marginally improve for the beginning of the Bank Holiday, with dry and mild weather predicted for the Friday and Saturday.

"A Russian biker gang, which Vladimir Putin  describes as his 'friends', has camped out on the Polish border after being banned from entering the country for a World War II memorial ride. Polish authorities said last week they would ban entry to the Night Wolves, with leaders calling their plans to ride through Poland en route to commemorations of World War II a 'provocation'. The group vowed to enter anyway and 15 were seen Monday morning at the border crossing between Brest, Belarus, and Terespol, Poland. Scroll down for video .

'Friends': Vladimir Putin, centre, poses for a picture with members of the Night Wolves gang in 2011 . They were allowed to go on by Belarusian guards but  they were then held in a hangar by Polish officials. Poland is extremely critical of Russian actions in Ukraine, and is disturbed that the Night Wolves has rallied against the Ukrainian government and celebrated Russia's annexation of Crimea. Border guard spokesman Dariusz Sienicki said: 'These people will not cross into Poland. Each of them will individually receive a decision denying them entry into Poland's territory'. Some Russian bikers had been seen entering Poland earlier but they appeared to belong to another organisation whose members are allowed to enter.

Bond: Polish bikers welcome a Russian biker who just crossed into Poland at the border crossing with Belarus. Some Russian bikers who are not members of the Night Wolves have been allowed to enter . Many Poles view the Night Wolves with suspicion because the pro-Putin bikers have rallied against the Ukrainian government and celebrated Russia's annexation of Crimea. Members of the Night Wolves rode down en masse to Ukraine's Crimea peninsula just after it was annexed by Russia in March 2014, and members have also fought with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. The German government has also expressed unease at the bikers and said they would not be welcome. 'This is not a normal bike club. They are tools in the hand of Vladimir Putin to make propaganda,' said Tomasz Czuwara, spokesman for the Open Dialog Foundation, a Polish group that supports Ukraine. President: The Night Wolves leader Alexander Zaldostanov, known as the surgeon, leads a procession of bikers out of Moscow as they started the memorial run on Saturday . A flag bearing the image of Stalin is seen as Night Wolves bikers gather in Moscow ahead of the memorial run . Many Poles view the Night Wolves with suspicion because the pro-Putin bikers have rallied against the Ukrainian government and celebrated Russia's annexation of Crimea . Not all Poles are against them, however. The head of a Polish bikers' group, Wiktor Wegrzyn, called the Polish opposition to the bikers 'anti-Russia hysteria'. He and dozens of other Polish bikers gathered on the Polish side of the border Monday to greet and escort the Night Wolves in case they should make it through. The Night Wolves want to travel across Eastern Europe to honour the Red Army soldiers who died in the Allied defeat of Hitler's Germany, visiting their graves and other war sites. Their aim was to arrive in Berlin for ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II on May 8. They left Moscow on Saturday with tattooed leader Alexander Zaldostanov leading a column of bikers waving red flags with portraits of Stalin and the wartime slogan 'For the Motherland! For Stalin!' out of the gang's clubhouse. Russia's Foreign Ministry said it was 'indignant about the refusal of Polish authorities', and accused Warsaw of lying about the real reasons it was barring the bikers. Members of the  Night Wolves Motorcycle Club lay flowers to the Mount of Glory memorial complex in the village of Sloboda, some 25 kilometers east of Minsk,  to honour Soviet soldiers of WWII . A  Night Wolves biker gives a St. Georges ribbon to a Belarussian military academy cadet at Mount of Glory monument on the outskirts of Minsk, Belarus yesterday . The Night Wolves are closely linked to President Vladimir Putin, who has joined the bikers several times at rallies, riding a Harley-Davidson trike, and called them his 'friends.' The gang's leader, Zaldostanov, 52, nicknamed 'the Surgeon' due to his former profession, told journalists on Saturday: 'We won't change our plans or our route.' 'If they don't let us all come in together, then we will enter one by one, using numerous different entry points,' he added. 'If we give up on this rally, then we would have to give up on everything else: May 9 (Victory Day holiday in Russia)… our history and all our values,' he said. But many of the bikers said they had been unable to get visas for Europe's Schengen zone. Zaldostanov said his passport is still at an embassy in Moscow, not specifying which one, and that he did not yet know if he would get the necessary visa for the trip. The bikers intend to visit war graves and war memorials in the countries they pass through. They also plan to stop at the former Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp, built by the Nazis in occupied Poland and liberated by Soviet forces. Night Wolves bikers arrive at Mount of Glory monument on the outskirts of Minsk, Belarus, yesterday . 'I don't know what they're afraid of. We are not harming anyone, we are just honouring the memory of those who fell to destroy Fascism,' said Alexei Magister, the president of a biker club linked to the Night Wolves. 'We're not afraid of the welcome we'll get in Berlin. Our grandfathers weren't afraid!' said Alexei Vereshchyagin, a biker who was taking a break from fighting Ukrainian forces in the pro-Russian separatist hub of Lugansk. The Night Wolves biker group was founded in 1989, just before the fall of the USSR, and has around 5,000 members across the former Soviet Union.

"A senior writer for the Australian Financial Review has labelled Anzacs 'racist yobs', while standing up for an SBS football reporter  who was sacked after condemning Anzac day on Twitter. SBS journalist Scott McIntyre was fired on Sunday over his tweets which called Anzac day 'the cultification of an imperialist invasion' and accused Australian Diggers of committing war crimes which included 'widespread rape and theft.' Speaking up in support of him, the AFR's Geoff Winestock wrote on the social media site: 'Ridiculous. Frightening. I also think Anzacs were racist yobs and Anzac Day is a death cult. Sack me Fairfax.' On Friday, the day before Anzac day, Mr Winestock said of the memorial: 'Anzac Day wish: in next 30 years there will be no wars and in 50 years no soldiers around to honour.' Scroll down for video . Australian Financial Review journalist Geoff Winestock (left) has spoken out in support of sacked SBS journalist Scott McIntyre (right), who was fired on Sunday over his controversial Anzac day tweets . The senior writer for the Australian Financial Review labelled Anzacs 'racist yobs' The day before Anzac day, Mr Winestock said he hoped 'in 50 years no soldiers around to honour' Both Fairfax and Mr Winestock declined to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. After a public backlash against McIntyre's comments,  SBS Managing Director Michael Ebeid and Director of Sport, Ken Shipp said in a joint statement that his 'highly inappropriate and disrespectful' comments have 'caused his on-air position at SBS to become untenable.' 'Mr McIntyre’s actions have breached the SBS Code of Conduct and social media policy and as a result, SBS has taken decisive action to terminate Mr McIntyre’s position at SBS, with immediate effect.' McIntyre's comments sparked outrage late on Anzac day, with Communications Minister Malcolm Turnball calling them 'despicable remarks' and social media users taking to twitter to spread the #sackScottMcIntre hashtag. In his tweets, the SBS football journalist condemned Anzac day as an 'imperialist invasion.' McIntyre referred to the Anzac's landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey . 'We remember and commemorate our ANZACs': SBS Michael Ebeid was quick to distance the broadcaster from McIntyre's comments on Saturday evening, saying they are 'not at all the views of @SBS' 'The cultification of an imperialist invasion of a foreign nation that Australia had no quarrel with is against all ideals of modern society,' McIntyre tweeted, referring to the Anzac's landing on Turkey's Gallipoli peninsula. In other tweets, the reporter mocked the 'these brave Anzacs' and accused Diggers of committing war crimes. 'Remembering the summary execution, widespread rape and theft committed by these 'brave' Anzacs in Egypt, Palestine and Japan,' he tweeted. 'Wonder if the poorly-read, largely white, nationalist drinkers and gamblers pause today to consider the horror that all mankind suffered. Mr McIntyre has more than 30,000 Twitter followers. The SBS journalist accused the Australian diggers of committing war crimes . McIntyre condemned the commemoration of Anzac Day and mocked the Digger's bravery . McIntyre's comments referred to the soldiers as 'terrorists' and were met with disgust by Twitter users . McIntyre's comments came on the 100th anniversary of the tragic Battle of Gallipoli (members of the public seen streaming into the Australian War Memorial, right, and names of fallen soldiers, left) Mr Turnbull also chimed into the discussion, calling the comments 'offensive' SBS's managing director Michael Ebeid was quick to distance the national broadcaster from McIntyre's comments on Saturday evening, after incensed social media users launched a Twitter tirade calling for the company to fire the reporter. 'Comments from @mcintinhos are his own, disrespectful and not at all the views of @SBS. We remember and commemorate our ANZACs,' Mr Ebeid wrote on Twitter. The offensive tweets were still live on McIntyre's Twitter feed the day after they were published, prompting angry social media users to accuse SBS of being 'complicit' and labelling Mr Ebeid's tweet a 'token apology.' SBS's managing director Michael Ebeid was quick to distance the media company . Angry social media users accused SBS of being 'complicit' Others accused SBS Managing Director Mr Ebeid's of making a 'token apology' last night . Social media users claimed that the tweets were offensive and 'un-Australian' especially on Anzac Day . SBS has since responded with an official apology for offence caused, stating 'respect for Australian audiences is paramount at SBS.' 'At SBS, employees on and off air are encouraged to participate in social media, however maintaining the integrity of the network and audience trust is vital,' Mr Ebeid and Mr Shipp said in the today's statement. 'It is unfortunate that on this very important occasion, Mr McIntyre’s comments have compromised both. 'SBS apologises for any offence or harm caused by Mr McIntyre’s comments which in no way reflect the views of the network. SBS supports our Anzacs and has devoted unprecedented resources to coverage of the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.'

Calling Anzac's war criminals on this sacred day!' 'Come on SBS this disrespectful little grub needs to go #sackScottMcIntyre,' Jimmy Nuciforo added. 'The ANZACS died defending what this idiot is abusing - free speech,' tweeted another social media user. The hashtag #sackScottMcIntyre began trending on Twitter after social media users saw his comments . McIntyre's comments were labelled offensive, especially in light of the centenary of Gallipoli . Some Twitter users defended his right to free speech, and said that if Mr McIntyre was fired for 'speaking the truth' that was compromising his right to express himself. Others took offense to the fact the comments were coming from someone employed with taxpayer funds. 'He should lose his taxpayer funded job,' said one Twitter user, while another said, 'Not normally my thing, but since I am paying for it .... #sackScottMcIntyre'.","Australian Financial Review writer Geoff Winestock told Fairfax to sack him .

"A young mother has spoken of her fear that she could die at any moment due to a rare heart condition that should have killed her at the age of three. Betheny Coyne, from Wigan, Lancashire, was diagnosed with a rare heart defect before she was born - and was never expected to reach her fourth birthday. But she defied medical predictions and now, aged 24, she is mother to three healthy children. This is despite being warned that each pregnancy could have placed so much extra strain on her heart that she would die. Fearing her heart is like a 'ticking time bomb ', she is determined to make as many memories as possible with her family, and will be getting married in February next year. Betheny Coyne, 24 (pictured with daughters Haley, Harper and Grace), was diagnosed with a rare heart defect before she was born - and was never expected to reach her fourth birthday . Miss Coyne said: 'If I didn't have my children or my fiancé, Mark, I'd spend my life worrying I was going to die. 'I can't have any more surgery on my heart so it's a case of living with my heart defect and ensuring I do everything I want to in life while I can. 'I have defied doctors by getting this far - so we just take every day as it comes and try to take pictures of everything. 'I just want to make sure that the kids are happy and that we make lots of memories as a family as I know my condition makes me a ticking time bomb.' Miss Coyne was born with a heart condition known as coarctation of the aorta, which caused her need open heart surgery three times as a baby. The condition makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood around the body due to a narrowed aorta, the main artery that leaves the left side of the heart. The risk is that it may narrow further at any time, meaning the blood will stop going round the body properly, and in turn cause complete heart failure. Miss Coyne's parents were first told their daughter had a heart defect before she was born, but it was only later scans that revealed the true extent of the rare condition. Due to her uncertain life expectancy, Bethany wore a heart monitor to school and went for regular check-ups. She still has to go for an ultrasound scan every six months to check her heart health. Miss Coyne (with partner Mark) was born with born with a heart condition known as coarctation of the aorta, which caused her need open heart surgery three times as a baby. Doctors warned being pregnant could have placed a fatal amount of strain on her heart - but once again, she defied the odds . Fearing her heart is like a 'ticking time bomb ', she is determined to make as many memories as possible with her family, and will be getting married in February next year after getting engaged on holiday last year . She said: 'I worry every time I go for an appointment about what they are going to say, it's a constant uncertainty. 'Growing up with the condition was difficult because it felt so unfair that I was going into hospital all of the time for tests and check-ups while other children didn't have to. 'The possibility of dying at any moment didn't really affect me until I had children. 'You just get on with life when it's just you, but when you have kids you have more responsibility and something to live for.

The condition makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood around the body due to a narrowed aorta, the main artery that leaves the left side of the heart. The risk is that it may narrow further at any time, meaning the blood will stop going round the body properly, and in turn cause complete heart failure and death. 'Now I worry about it all the time, but knowing that we are taking lots of pictures and have the wedding to look forward to makes it easier. 'It was only when I was told I probably shouldn't have children that I realised how much I wanted to have them. I knew I'd regret it if I never became a mum.' She became pregnant with her first child, Haley, unexpectedly when she was 19 - and before she met her now fiancé, Mark. She had previously been warned by her heart specialist that having children would cause a massive strain on her heart. She said: 'I was really worried when I fell pregnant, but I tried to live as normal a life as possible and focused on the baby.' Thankfully, her heart condition is not genetic, so there was little chance of her passing it onto her children. Speakiing about giving birth to her daughter in 2009, she said: 'I was so relieved. When I gave birth it went so well - it was completely normal.' The following year, she met her fiancé Mark Brimble, 35, in a local bar . Aware of the seriousness of her condition, she told him about it early on in the relationship. Thankfully, her heart condition is not genetic, so there was little chance of her passing it onto her children . Miss Coyne said: 'I can't have any more surgery on my heart so it's a case of living with my defect and ensuring I do everything I want to in life while I can. She is pictured at Disneyland Paris . She said: 'When I told him, I actually offered to leave him because I could see how it might get difficult later on. 'He was so understanding, though, he's been great the whole time we've been together.' On February 20 2013, Miss Coyne gave birth to the couple's first child, Grace - and was induced four days early as a precaution for her heart condition. Mr Brimble then proposed last May while they were on holiday and baby Harper arrived in the December. Miss Coybe said: 'We don't want any more children - the main thing now is having a great time with the three we have. 'Before Harper was born we took the girls to Disneyland Paris for Haley's fourth birthday and we had the best time. However there are constant reminders of her condition. At times, breathing can be very difficult and there are days when she feels exhausted. She said: 'Mark is an amazing dad, so I would have no worries about the children if I died.' June Davidson, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'Years of research has helped to dramatically improve survival rates for babies born with congenital heart defects from a position where very few babies survived to one where almost all do.' 'However, more research is needed to better understand the longer term consequences of living with congenital heart disease so we can further improve the quality of more people's lives.'","Betheny Coyne was diagnosed with the defect before she was born .

"Toxicology results released Monday show Linden, New Jersey police officer Pedro Abad (pictured) had three times the legal limit of alcohol in his system when he crashed his car last month . Toxicology results show that an off-duty New Jersey officer was drunk when he caused a wrong-way crash that killed another officer and a friend on a New York City highway, a Staten Island prosecutor said Monday. Tests show Linden Officer Pedro Abad's blood alcohol content was 0.24; the legal limit in New York is 0.08. Chief Assistant District Attorney Daniel Master wouldn't comment on possible charges against the officer stemming from the March 20 crash. Linden Officer Frank Viggiano and friend Joe Rodriguez were killed; Abad and Officer Patrik Kudlac were critically injured. Authorities say Abad crashed head-on into a tractor-trailer after leaving a Staten Island strip club. The truck driver suffered injuries that weren't considered life-threatening. There was no immediate response to an email seeking comment from the union representing Linden police officers. Investigators had applied for a warrant to test Abad's blood shortly after the accident. Hours before the crash, Abad had posted a photo on his Instagram page of three shot glasses filled with what he identified as 'Jack Daniels Fire on the house.' The photo included a caption of a toast he said he had given. Abad and fellow officer Patrik Kudlac were critically injured in the crash while another cop Frank Viggiano and friend Joe Rodriguez died . The driver of the tractor-trailer was also injured but his injuries were not thought to be life threatening . VictimsL Above, officer Viggiano (left) and Rodriguez (right), the two men who were killed in the crash . 'The 3 of us, are decent people. There's a decent woman out there for each of us. Sure it's cool to be single every now and then, but I don't give a damn what ANYONE says. At the end of the day, I want a family. I want to settle down. We all do. So here's to finding that which we all hope for.' Abad had two drunken-driving arrests in the last four years, including one for an accident in which he plowed through the wall of a convenience store, records show. He was arrested on a charge of driving under the influence in Roselle, New Jersey, in January 2011 after his car 'put a hole completely through the building' housing a New Way Supermarket, a police report said. Abad was issued a summons for DUI and reckless driving, but apparently the case didn't conclude in any citations or violations, the state Motor Vehicle Commission said. Abad (left) posted a photo of three whiskey shots (right) to his Instagram just hours before the deadly crash . The crash occurred after the three off-duty New Jersey cops and their friend left this Staten Island strip club . Thirteen months later, Abad was charged with DUI in Rahway, New Jersey. A police dashboard camera video showed him weaving, wobbling and slurring his words as he attempted to complete a field sobriety test. Abad's driver's license was suspended after the second arrest, beginning in October 2013 and concluding in May 2014, the Motor Vehicle Commission said. A judge then required Abad to fit his car with an ignition interlock, which won't allow a vehicle to start until the driver blows into a device to measure his blood-alcohol level and is deemed sober. The interlock device was removed last September, the commission said. Abad Jr. (left) had eight accidents and two DUIs on his record before the Staten Island crash.

"In 2011 the unmanned Dawn spacecraft became humanity’s first ever emissary to the huge asteroid Vesta, which resides in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. And using images collected by the spacecraft, Nasa has unveiled an interactive tool that lets you explore this world. Using the map you can see a huge amount of features on Vesta, from craters to the amount of sunlight hitting the surface - and switching to ‘3D mode’ also lets you fly around like you were in your own spacecraft. Called Vesta Trek, the interactive programme lets you explore massive craters on the body - which has no atmosphere, and thus no protection like our own Earth. Vesta, discovered in 1807, is the second most massive body in the asteroid belt after the dwarf planet Ceres - which Dawn has now travelled to. It completes a rotation every five hours and 18 minutes, with a temperature ranging from -3°C (27°F) to -188°C (-306°F). Some meteorites on Earth have been found to originate from places like Vesta. As you explore the asteroid, you will come across various ‘troughs’ - areas where the ground sinks away. The largest of these is up to 12 miles (20km) wide and 289 miles (465km) long, similar in size to the Grand Canyon on Earth. Elsehwere there are craters, hills and mountains on the surface, most formed by impacts. On the map you can switch between three main views - over the North Pole, a Global view or looking down onto the South Pole. Various tools also let you find out more information about the asteroid. You can draw lines on the surface to see elevation levels, place a pin to see how the angle of the sun changes at a location over time, or even draw a box to generate files to use with a 3D printer. There’s also an option to 3D print an entire model of Vesta. Nasa scientists in California have revealed an interactive 3D map for Vesta (shown) using images from the Dawn spacecraft. The map lets you see features on the surface including craters, hills, mountains and even 'canyons' You can also measure elevation changes on the surface and see different measurement data. And a 'gaming mode' lets you fly around the largest asteroid in the solar system using your keyboard's arrow keys. In the bottom right of the map is a scale, where you can change the units of measurement by clicking. Aside from using imperial and metric units of measurement - kilometres and miles - it also lets you measure distances in Golden Gate Bridges, football fields and school buses. Various data can also be overlayed on the map, such as the amount of iron or hydrogen in certain regions. The Dawn spacecraft spent a year, from 2011 to 2012, mapping and exploring Vesta. It is so large compared to other asteroids that is sometimes referred to as a minor planet. The spacecraft is now orbiting the dwarf planet Ceres, and over the next few months will be spiraling down closer and closer to image more of it.

"The Parole Board is reviewing the case of Colin Pitchfork, who was jailed for life in 1988 on the basis of DNA evidence after raping and killing two schoolgirls . The Parole Board is reviewing the case of a murderer who was the first man to be convicted on the basis of DNA evidence. Colin Pitchfork was jailed for life in 1988 for raping and killing two schoolgirls. He strangled 15-year-old Lynda Mann to death after raping her on a deserted footpath in the Leicestershire village of Narborough in 1983. Three years later he raped and killed Dawn Ashworth, also 15, less than a mile from where he murdered Lynda. Pitchfork was finally caught two years later thanks to DNA tests on all the men in surrounding villages. He received a 30-year minimum sentence which was then cut to 28 years in 2009, meaning he was supposed to be eligible for release next year. A spokesman for the Parole Board said: 'We can confirm that the Secretary of State for Justice has referred the case of Colin Pitchfork to the Parole Board for a review of his suitability for release. 'If the Board does not direct his release, it has been asked to advise the Secretary of State on his suitability for open conditions (Category D prison).' Once a case has been referred to the Board, it usually takes around six months before a decision is issued, meaning the double murderer could be out this year. Pitchfork argued at his 2009 appeal against his sentence that the 30 years was 'manifestly' excessive. He was jailed at Leicester Crown Court in 1988 after pleading guilty to two counts of murder, two of rape, two of indecent assault and one of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Announcing the decision to reduce the minimum term by two years in 2009, the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, said the appeal was being allowed to a 'very restricted and limited extent relating to exceptional progress in custody'. He emphasised that the decision 'has no bearing whatever on the continuing effect of the sentence of life imprisonment on the appellant'. The judge added: 'He cannot be released unless and until the safety of the public is assured.' Former Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge ruled in 2009 that Pitchfork should not be released until the public could be assured it was safe . After the world's first mass screening for DNA - where 5,000 men in three villages were asked to volunteer blood or saliva samples - Pitchfork was eventually caught. The Lord Chief Justice at the time said after he was jailed that 'from the point of view of the safety of the public I doubt if he should ever be released'. Lord Judge said in 2009 that Pitchfork's progress since he was first incarcerated 'goes far beyond general good behaviour and positive response to his custodial sentence, but reflects very creditable assistance to disabled individuals outside the prison system'. He added: 'On the evidence before us he has sought to address the reasons behind the commission of these offences. He has achieved a high standard of education, to degree level. 'In 20 years in custody he has never been placed on report and he is trusted to help with the well-being of fellow inmates.' Lord Judge said: 'Beyond all that he has made himself a specialist in the transcription of printed music into Braille, thus using the opportunities he has taken to educate himself in prison to the benefit of others. 'This is an intensely specialised skill and his work is used throughout this country and internationally with the support of the RNIB.' Lord Judge said the court could not 'identify any sufficient reason' why the exceptional progress made 'should not be recognised and given practical effect in the assessment now to be made of the minimum term to be served by the appellant', and reduced it by two years. On November 22, 1983, the body of 15-year-old Lynda Mann was found raped and strangled on a deserted footpath running between a cemetery and a psychiatric hospital in the Leicestershire village of Narborough. Almost three years later, in July 1986, the body of another 15-year-old, Dawn Ashworth, from nearby Enderby, was found in almost identical circumstances in a wooded area, less than a mile from the scene of Lynda's murder. The dead girl had been taking a shortcut home from school instead of her usual route, but there can be little doubt that her assailant, believing he had 'got away with it' once, was on the look-out for other teenagers to assault, terrorise and murder in the same way. Initially, a local man confessed to the second murder and his blood was found to be the same group as blood found at the scene. There can be no doubt that had it not been for advances in science, he would have been convicted while Colin Pitchfork remained free. However, two years later, semen samples found at the crime scenes were used to match the DNA of Pitchfork, a baker and convicted flasher. He became the first criminal in the world to be convicted based on DNA fingerprinting, following the first mass screening of 5,000 men in three neighbouring villages.","Colin Pitchfork raped and murdered two 15-year-old girls in the 1980s .

"Mitchell Keenan, with his father Keith, who had to have his toes amputated after contracting frostbite while being forced to live in a tent . The family of a disabled man claim he had to have all of his toes amputated after he was forced to live in a tent through the winter because he was evicted from his home. Mitchell Keenan, 32, was diagnosed with frostbite six weeks ago after his sister discovered his blackened toes and rushed him to hospital. They were so badly diseased that they could not be saved and they had to be amputated. It came after Mr Keenan had been living in the tent with his father Keith, 62, following their eviction from their four-bedroom home in Skelmersdale, West Lancashire, last year when they fell behind with their repayments. Mr Keenan's father was also diagnosed with severe health problems including malnourishment, scabies and dementia. Mr Keenan's aunt, Dawn Doyle, 54, said: 'It's absolutely outrageous what has happened to my brother and nephew. 'They lived in their home for 30 years and got into difficulty last year. 'They had their benefits sanctioned and things just spiralled out of control. 'They both have neurological conditions and disabilities and kept missing jobs interviews, so the problem got worse and worse. 'In July they lost their home and I tried everywhere to get them accommodation but nowhere would take them.' Ms Doyle says she was then forced to buy her brother and nephew a tent, which they pitched on the Beacon hill in Skelmersdale. She also supplied them with food parcels from local food banks, while trying to provide for her own family. She added: 'I felt awful that I couldn't take them in, but I'm a single parent, with my own disabilities and I just knew I couldn't cope. 'I tried my best for them and contacted so many different organisations, but just kept getting turned away. 'Social Services said they couldn't come and assess them because they were in a tent - it was just farcical. Mr Keenan's toes, which eventually had to be amputated after he caught frostbite from living in a tent during winter after being evicted from his home . 'When we saw Mitchell's toes we were horrified, that this can happen to people in the 21st century is disgusting.' Mr Keenan has now been given temporary accommodation by West Lancashire Borough Council and his father Keith has been taken in by the Stonham housing association. Ms Doyle believes that the problems all stemmed from the government's spare bedroom benefit cuts. She explained: 'The bedroom tax is an awful thing, it's affecting people's lives all over the country and needs to be repealed.' A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: 'Mr Keenan and his son have never been sanctioned and continue to be supported through benefits and by jobcentre staff. 'We have given their local council hundreds of thousands of pounds to support vulnerable people through our housing benefit reforms.'","Mitchell Keenan and his father Keith were evicted from their family home .

"Prince Harry will tonight fly out of the UK to Australia without seeing his new niece or nephew . A disappointed Prince Harry will tonight fly out of the UK to Australia without seeing his new niece or nephew. With the Duchess of Cambridge now overdue for the birth of her second child, the prince will not be able to meet the new royal baby until he returns to this country in mid May. Harry, who will be bumped down to fifth in the line of succession by the new arrival, had returned briefly at the weekend to hand out prizes at the London Marathon after undertaking several engagements in Turkey to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign. He was dragging out his return until tonight in the hope of getting to meet the new little prince or princess. But with Duchess now several days overdue, Harry is being forced to return to Australia where he is on a month-long placement with the army, followed by a week long official tour of New Zealand. Instead he spent time playing doting uncle to his nephew, Prince George, who turns two in July, at the Cambridge's apartment at Kensington Palace. Kate and her husband, Prince William, had been told to expect their new son or daughter – who will be fourth in line to the throne – by Saturday, according to sources. The Duchess – whose son, Prince George, was also around a week late - herself told well-wishers earlier this year that the new little prince or princess was due 'mid to late April'. When Prince George's little brother or sister is born the news will be revealed to royal correspondents in a press release followed by an announcement two minutes on the Kensington and Buckingham Palace social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram. Details of their arrival – including their six, birth weight and details of the attending medical staff - will then be posted in the traditional way on an easel outside Buckingham Palace. Scroll down for video . Although palace officials have barred media from camping outside the private Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where Kate is due to give birth, in order to prevent what they describe as a 'media circus', excitement was mounting yesterday with royal 'superfans' continuing their own round-the-clock vigil. The Duchess – whose son, Prince George, was also around a week late - herself told well-wishers earlier this year that the new little prince or princess was due 'mid to late April' Harry had returned briefly at the weekend to hand out prizes at the London Marathon after undertaking several engagements in Turkey (pictured) to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign . The mounting tension saw bookmakers' cash in with a flurry of bets on everything from the time of birth to the new baby's name – and even their hair and eye colour. Prince Harry will no doubt be encouraged to see that 4/1 odds are being offered for the baby to be a fellow red head. Ladbrokes customers appeared to favour Arthur for a boy, with odds collapsing to 8/1, and Alice remaining the hot favourite for a girl with odds of just 5/4. Some were still hankering after Diana (14/1), in memory of William's late mother, or even Elizabeth in honour of the Queen (6/1). The firm said one male customer in the Manchester area had bet £10,000 on the new baby being a girl, the largest single wager so far received. Spokesman, Jessica Bridge, said: 'As far as the money is concerned they will soon welcome Princess Alice into the family.' Coral said yesterday that it had seen a slew of bets come in that the baby will arrive today (Monday) – now 6/1 joint favourite – with odds of 10-1 that the nation is still waiting at the end of the week. Many bookmakers are also offering 4/1 odds of the couple welcoming their new child into the world on Wednesday – their fourth wedding anniversary. Prince William and Kate pose with their son Prince George at the National History Museum in London . Preparations have been made outside the Lindo Wing of the hospital for the huge crowds expected to welcome the royal birth - with the Duchess said to be up to four days overdue . As the 'spare to the heir', it is unlikely that the duke and duchess's new baby will accede to the throne – although it is not unheard of. Most recently the Queen's own father became King George VI when his elder brother, King Edward VIII, unexpectedly abdicated over his love for 'unsuitable' American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Thanks to recent changes in the law of succession, if the new baby is girl then their claim to the throne cannot be superseded by a younger brother, should William and Kate go on to have a third child. She will also be known as HRH Princess (forename) of Cambridge after the Queen altered a century-old ruling in the run up to Prince George's birth which had meant that only the eldest son of a Prince of Wales (as well as the children of a monarch and the sons of those children) was entitled to the honour. The new arrival will also bump Prince Andrew out of the 'top five' for the first time. He will drop to sixth in line to the throne. His eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, will find herself relegated to seventh – the advantage being that she will no longer require the Queen's approval for her marriage. Her younger sister, Princess Eugenie, will become eighth. If the baby is a girl it will be the first Princess of Cambridge to be born for 182 years. Kate has said in the past that she favours a boy but that her husband rather likes the idea of a girl. Grandfather Prince Charles has said he would like a girl – while his late wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, always longed for a daughter.","Prince Harry will  fly out of UK tonight to continue placement in Australia .

"Melbourne radio broadcaster John Burns has been revealed as the media personality alleged to have vilified Richmond's Bachar Houli. Burns, who hosts 3AW morning show Ross and John with Ross Stevenson, is alleged to have referred to Houli as a 'terrorist' at a club function at the MCG on Friday night during the Tigers' match against Melbourne. The radio station confirmed a complaint has been made against Mr Burns and said he doesn't recall making the comment, and is 'mortified' by the allegation. 3AW host John Burns (pictured) has been named as the media personality who allegedly called  Bachar Houli a 'terrorist' John Burns said a friend sitting with him at the time also didn't recall the comment being made. Mr Burns spoke to 3AW's Tom Elliott on Monday afternoon and said that while he didn't recall making such a comment, he apologised unreservedly if any offence had been caused. 'The game was underway and the person in front of me turned around and said 'what did you say'?' Mr Burns said on the radio show. 'I wasn't aware of having said anything really and I don't recall what I said but he alleged that I made a comment that was offensive. 'I don't recall that comment.' Mr Burns went on to claim that the person he was sitting with did not hear his comment. When quizzed by Tom Elliot on how much liquor he had consumed during the game, Mr Burns said he had enjoyed himself but alcohol did not contribute to the events. He said he couldn't even begin to imagine what words of his might have been misconstrued but went on to tell Tom Elliot that he 'didn't say anything like accidental tourists, I wouldn't think'. 'I can't recall saying anything that I intended to be offensive to anybody on the other side of the game.' Mr Elliot told Mr Burns that he has heard the term 'terrorist' and 'jihadist' being used to describe Bachar Houli on numerous occasions at matches, however Mr Burns said he has never witnessed this. Bachar Houli (pictured) became the first Muslim man to play at top level AFL in 2006 . He said Mr Houli is a 'delightful man'. Mr Houli became the first Muslim to play AFL the game at the top level in 2006, when he was employed by Essendon. The 27-year-old moved to Richmond in 2011 and has since taken on the role of multicultural ambassador. In a statement, Mr Burns again apologised 'unreservedly', in particular to the people at the match and members of the Richmond Football Club. 'I had the pleasure of attending the Richmond Football Club function on Friday night,' Mr Burns said. 'During the match, I sat with a friend and we were catching up and talking about the game. It has been suggested to me that during a conversation with my friend, I was overheard saying something which that person found offensive. 'I have no recollection of making an offensive remark. 'However, I acknowledge that a complaint has been made and the idea that something I've said has offended someone is mortifying to me. Houli is a multicultural ambassador for the AFL . 'If I have said anything that has offended anybody, I unreservedly apologise. In particular, to the people at the match and the Richmond Football Club.' Richmond Football Club also released a statement and said they 'now consider the matter closed'. 'Richmond Football Club acknowledges the statement released by 3AW's John Burns this afternoon in relation to an incident that took place at the MCG on Friday night. 'The Club fully supports the staff member who brought this issue to its attention and accepts his version of events. We also accept the apology and now consider the matter closed.' Speaking to The Herald, Tigers captain Trent Cotchin said there is 'no place for it in our game,' when he was asked about the comments allegedly made against Houli. 'It's disappointing to see and hear and as a collective we need to make a stronger stand on it,' he said.","John Burns has come out to deny he called footy player a 'terrorist'

"Leaks from the investigation into shamed newsman Brian Williams were given to the press to pressure him into resignation, a report claims. News broke this weekend that the committee investigating the NBC star found he lied in his reporting to make himself look good at least 11 times. The leaked information, along a report that Williams lied during an interview on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, is designed to make the disgraced anchor negotiate an exit from his network, according to  media executives. Scroll down for video . Leaked: Media executives who spoke to POLITICO say that information given to the press from the NBC investigation into anchor Brian Williams (above) was designed to make the broadcaster resign . Iraq shame: Williams fell from grace after veterans called him out after he lied about being on board a US military chopper which was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, but miraculously managed to land . Investigative journalists at the network have been poring over Williams's past reports and statements after he was booted from the top job in TV news, hunting down signs of dishonesty. Williams was publicly suspended with no pay for six months after it emerged that he repeatedly told a self-aggrandizing, false story about being aboard a military helicopter hit by an RPG over Iraq. The anchor has up to a $50million contract and POLITICO claims that he is being pressured to resign. The site reported that he could receive up to $30million in an exit agreement with NBC. 'You’re dead. Now negotiate,' one media executive told the website. Williams signed a deal with the network last year to continue at the network thought to be worth $10million a year, and he is thought to be looking at a minimum of $20million if he leaves. The eleven incidents cited in media reports about the secretive investigation would mean the trail of deceit from the fallen face of NBC's Nightly News goes far deeper than previously reported. Further scrutiny of Williams's record turned up other questionable claims, including dodging rocket fire over Israel and seeing a body floating through the French Quarter of New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. Even more such claims have been turned up now, according to reports by CNN and the Washington Post. Both cite a briefing given to NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke on Thursday in New York City at which top executives were updated on the investigation into their flagship news anchor's reporting. Egyptian experience: The latest specific Williams tall tale to emerge dates to 2011 in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Williams said he stared into the eyes of mounted regime soldiers during a violent protest . Tall tales: Information leaked from an NBC investigation points to 11 incidents where Williams lied about his reporting. Above, the anchor appears on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart (right) CNN said 10 claims had been found, while the Post said the figure was 11. An earlier report in the New York Times identified a particular incident, dating back to Williams' coverage of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. NBC investigators honed in on a February 2011 Daily Show appearance where Williams boasted that he had looked into the eyes of mounted Egyptian soldiers in Cairo's Tahrir Square, and seen armed men beat protesters. From his conversation with host Jon Stewart, Williams implies he was in the thick of the chaotic pro-democracy movement down on the ground. However, the Times said, NBC news broadcasts from the time only show that he was on a balcony overlooking the square from a safe distance during violent stretches. Close to the wind: Another questionable Williams claim comes from Israel's 2006 war with Hezbollah. Williams said rockets flew 'just underneath' a helicopter he was on when they seem to have gone nowhere near it . Williams is currently halfway through his six-month suspension from his roles as anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News. He was replaced by Lester Holt, who has kept ratings relatively steady. It is unclear whether NBC will put Williams back in the top slot when the suspension ends, or look for a way to get rid of him. Williams has reportedly been banned from speaking publicly about the investigation, or defending himself against any new claims. Industry analysts have said the NBC report is likely to prove significant as the network wrangles over what to ultimately do with Williams, whose contract kept him anchoring the Nightly News through 2019. The findings could play a part in any legal discussions, it was suggested, with NBC gaining leverage over its employee by either agreeing to keep it under wraps or threatening to go public. A decision about Williams's fate is still 'weeks away' according to CNN.","Former face of  Nightly News was suspended for lying about Iraq report .

"A  bar is under police investigation after a comedian discovered a secret two-way mirror hanging on a door across from the toilet in the women's restroom. Tamale Rocks was performing at Chicago bar, Cigars and Stripes, when she stumbled on the creepy looking glass and filmed a video of the discovery on her smartphone - revealing that opening the door  took her into a closet providing  a clear view of the stall. But despite public outrage the bar's owner Ronnie Lottz told website Jezebel he has no plans to get rid of it - even insisting that the mirror, which was initially set up as part of a Halloween prank in 2001, has brought his staff  ‘joy’.

Tamale found the intrusive mirror on Saturday night and, horrified, took a video demonstrating that anyone standing on the other side would have a clear view of any woman using the toilet. 'There was no one in there at the time of [my] discovery - thankfully,' she said. '[But] there could have been.' When she approached Ronnie Lottz to demand an explanation, he seemed unconcerned and, shockingly, told her that he considered her video to be free promotion for his establishment. When contacted by Jezebel,  Mr Lottz added that Cigars and Stripes has had the two-way mirror since 2001, explaining that it was once used to scare women in the restroom by placing a light-up witch on the other side one Halloween. Bar owner Ronnie Lottz, pictured, said Cigars and Stripes's women's restroom has had the two-way mirror since 2001 . Arizona-born Tamale Rocks now lives and works in Chicago where she performs comedy and burlesque . He also insisted that the mirror was 'old news' and reiterated that he won't remove it. He said: 'I will burn this f****** place to the ground before I get rid of that mirror. Do you know how much joy that mirror has brought to us?' He also dismissed Tamale's concern as being part of a recent 'big movement in reality TV to be outraged about feminism'. 'If you don’t like the two-way mirror, go f*** yourself,' he added. Mr Lottz said: 'We specialize in making people feel very uncomfortable. It’s why we’re successful today.' Tamale talks into her smartphone camera, as she uncovers the two-way mirror . He added that anyone who didn't like it could 'stay home'. He did not acknowledge that women may not know that the restroom had a two-way mirror, as there is no sign notifying them next to it. Police are investigating the incident. Daily Mail Online has contacted Mr Lotz for comment. People can test for two-way by pressing a finger up to the glass; when using a traditional mirror, there will be gap between the finger and its reflection. If there is no gap, it is a two-way mirror.","Comedian Tamale Rocks filmed discovery of  the deceptive mirror .

"Teachers are helping pupils to cheat by giving advice during exams, wrongly bumping up marks and even writing coursework, it has been revealed. Tactics used to bend the rules were revealed by more than 500 whistleblowing teachers after an appeal by the exams watchdog. Ofqual found that one in five reported that colleagues had written sections of coursework, dictated essays or provided examples for students to copy. Teachers are helping pupils to cheat by giving advice during exams, wrongly bumping up marks and even writing coursework, it has been revealed (file picture) Details of the unethical techniques emerged at a Teacher Ethics In Assessment symposium at Oxford University. The Sunday Times reported that one teacher told Ofqual: ‘Giving students too much support in their coursework is a massive issue. It ranges from providing them with examples of good work, letting them copy others’ work [and] teachers standing over students telling them what to write.’ Another teacher said she was told she ‘would have to do it herself’ when she raised concerns with her head of department about her class struggling to produce work of sufficient quality. And 15 per cent said staff had given ‘hints’ or ‘pointers’ while invigilating exams. Glenys Stacey, Ofqual’s chief executive, said: ‘Teachers who bend the rules are deeply uncomfortable about it and do it in large part because of the pressure to get results.’ The latest Ofqual figures show 217 penalty notices were issued to schools and colleges for malpractice in 2013 – an increase of 61 per cent on the previous year.

"It's not something parking wardens are usually accused of... but some have been criticised for being too nice. An inspection in two Welsh towns found officers there were reluctant to issue tickets, letting many locals get away with parking offences. And their lax approach meant that parking in the evenings and at weekends had become a ‘free for all’. Inspectors in Welshpool and Llandrindod Wells have been accused of being too lax when it comes to giving out parking tickets for infringements (file picture) The investigation was carried out by officials from Powys County Council, who could not understand why the council was losing money on enforcing parking restrictions. Powys council needs to issue 40 per cent more tickets just to break even. Councillors shadowed wardens three times in the towns of Welshpool and Llandrindod Wells and found there were plenty of infringements, but many were going unticketed. In one case, a driver had already overrun their allotted time by 15 minutes, but the warden ‘still appeared to be reluctant to issue the ticket’. Officials also often did not penalise tradesmen for parking in restricted areas – even though only water and electricity vehicles are allowed to stop in them without permits. The councillors said some of the conversations they overheard between residents and officers ‘would indicate that paying to park may be the exception rather than the rule’. Even when tickets were issued, 39 per cent were cancelled at the first challenge. The councillors said some of the conversations they overheard between residents and officers ‘would indicate that paying to park may be the exception rather than the rule’ (file picture) The investigators suggested a range of actions to toughen up the operation, including shortening the grace period drivers are given after their time runs out before a ticket is issued. They said wardens are currently leaving it ‘too long’, particularly since the process to issue a ticket itself takes seven minutes and can be aborted at any time. They also said ticketing policies need to be more consistent across Powys as ‘decisions are made locally and sometimes contrary to police recommendations’. Some 5,000 tickets are issued in Powys, bringing in £1.2million a year, but the council is still subsidising the operation. The report said 7,000 tickets would need to be issued to make the service ‘cost neutral’.","Probe carried out by Powys council in Welshpool and Llandrindod Wells .

"A man has died in a road accident in north west China - eight months after his brother was tragically killed in exactly the same spot. The man in his 50s, who has only been named as Mr Zhang, was travelling on his three-wheeled motorbike in Dezhou City in east China when he was hit by a car at a busy junction and thrown off his bike. Villagers from Shoma Ying said that his younger brother had been on the same junction last August, when a collision with a lorry killed him instantly, according to the People's Daily Online. Tragic: The man, only named as Mr Zhang, was thrown off his motorbike when he was hit by a car. He later died in hospital from his injuries . Freak coincidence: His brother had died at the same junction eight months earlier after colliding with a lorry . Mr Zhang, the elder of the two brothers, was taken to hospital for his injuries but died shortly after. The silver car that hit Mr Zhang on his motorbike when he pulled out of the junction sped away from the scene without stopping. A driver who witnessed the accident tried to chase after the car but eventually lost it in traffic. Mr Zhang, who was unmarried, sold vegetables at the local market and was believed to use the stretch of road on a daily basis. Leftover vegetables were found in the trailer after the accident, which was found 30 metres away from the crushed motorbike. Shu Rongli, a police officer from the Dezhou City Public Security Bureau, said that the newly constructed road was not open yet and did not even have road signs. Aftermath: The trailer of the motorbike was found 30 metres away from the main vehicle . Poignant: Vegetables sold by Mr Zhang at the local market were found in the trailer after the crash . He added that those using it were doing so illegally. The driver in the silver car, who was using a fake registration plate, is under investigation by the police. Shu said that those involved in the accident lacked road safety knowledge, and he reminded motorists to be careful at junctions. Investigation: The driver of the silver car that sped away from the scene is still being investigated by police .","The man in his 50s, only named as Mr Zhang, had been on his motorbike .

"A petition has been launched asking for Sunrise's Samantha Armytage to apologise for comments she made on-air last month, dubbed by some viewers as 'racist'. The cause of controversy came when the 37-year-old interviewed non-identical twins from the UK, Lucy and Maria Aylmer, who have become a sensation around the world due to their opposite skin tones. Introducing the 18-year-olds, Armytage congratulated ginger-haired Lucy on getting 'her dad's fair skin,' saying 'good on her.' Controversy: Sunrise host Samantha Armytage has come under fire for a comment made during a Sunrise broadcast last month . 'The Aylmer twins come from a mixed race family in the UK,' the Seven presenter's introduction began. 'Maria has taken after her half Jamaican mum with dark skin and brown eyes and curly dark hair, but Lucy got her dad's fair skin, good on her, along with straight red hair and blue eyes.' Co-host David 'Kochie' Koch seemed taken aback by the comment, taking a confused glance in the 37-year-old's direction. Armytage and Sunrise vehemently deny the claims of the petition, with a Seven spokesperson telling Daily Mail Australia: 'Regular members of the Sunrise audience or anyone who has seen the clip in full will know that Sam was taking a dig at herself.' 'She frequently jokes about the fair skin that runs in her family and difficult it can be to manage in extreme environments.' Confusing moment: Interviewing non-identical twins from the UK, Lucy and Maria Aylmer, she congratulated Lucy on 'getting her dad's fair skin,' saying 'good on her' Mistake? Co-host David 'Kochie' Koch seemed taken aback by the comment, taking a confused glance in the 37-year-old's direction . Still, the comment wasn't recieved well by many viewers, who took to social media to express their displeasure and to accuse her of making a 'racist' remark. The Change.com petition, which has since been signed by 186 people, was launched on Monday, and demands that Armytage, producer Michael Pell or a representative from Sunrise apologise for the comment. It was started by Melbournian artist Jay Fifth, 27, who told Daily Mail Australia: 'By Sam and the show not recognising, acknowledging and rectifying the statement, they are telling Australia this is acceptable when it is not.' The 27-year-old, who is himself of mixed descent with a Jamaican mother and a Polish father, added on the site that 'the ""good on her"" comment was inappropriate, extremely offensive and very racist.' Unhappy viewers: A Change.com petition was launched on Monday and demands that Armytage, producer Michael Pell or a representative from Sunrise apologise for the comment. The twins are pictured here in childhood . It's the second comment by Armytage that's raised eyebrows in recent weeks. In an interview with Seven's Hamish McLachlan, Samantha said she can be 'fragile at times' thanks to her grueling schedule, which she described as torturous. 'Remember I get up at 3:40 every morning - and sleep deprivation is a form of torture they used at Guantánamo Bay, so I can be fragile at times.' Rough month: It's the second comment by Armytage that's raised eyebrows in recent weeks, as earlier in April she compared her grueling Sunrise schedule to sleep deprivation torture methods used in Guantánamo Bay .","A petition launched on Monday demanding Samantha Armytage apologise for 'racist' remark made last month .

"One of the earliest Spitfires ever to go into action has gone on sale for £2.5 million after spending 40 years buried in sand on the French beach it crashed on. The Mark 1 version of Reginald Mitchell's famous design was among the first built in March 1940 but Spitfire P9374, once flown by an airman involved in the Great Escape, never made it to the Battle of Britain as it crash-landed in May 1940. The fighter plane, dubbed the ballerina because of its grace in the skies, was being piloted by Flying Officer Peter Cazenove over Dunkirk when it was hit by a single bullet from a German Dornier bomber. Before it was lost, Spitfire P9374 was at one point almost certainly flown by Squadron Leader Roger Bushell, later 'Big X', who was part of the famous breakout from German prisoner of war camp Stalag Luft III. Scroll down for video . Back in the sky: This iconic Mark 1 plane was among the first built in March 1940, but Spitfire P9374 never made it to the Battle of Britain as it crash-landed over Dunkirk in May 1940. In 1980 the wreckage was discovered when part of it was spotted poking out from its sandy grave . Beached: German soldiers sitting on the Spitfire brought down on the wet sands at Calais by Flying Officer Peter Cazenove. It had been hit by a single bullet from a German Dornier bomber. The plane was consumed by the sandy beach and remained there for 40 years . Captured: The fighter plane (pictured left) was being piloted by Flying Officer Peter Cazenove (right) over Dunkirk when it was hit by a single bullet from a German Dornier bomber. Cazenove was then captured by the Nazis and taken to the Stalag Luft III prisoner of war camp . Cazenove, a 32-year-old Old Etonian of the stock-broking dynasty flying his first combat mission, had no choice but to bring the aircraft down on the wet sands at Calais, despite radioing in to say 'Tell mother I'll be home for tea!' shortly before doing so. He was then captured by the Nazis and also taken to the Stalag Luft III prisoner of war camp, famous for The Great Escape. The plane became consumed by the sandy beach and  remained there for the next 40 years. In 1980 the wreckage was discovered when part of it was spotted poking out from its sandy grave. It was corroded and covered in barnacles but amazingly still intact. The plane was dragged from the beach and taken to the Musée de l'Air in Paris. Sadly, Cazenove died just a few weeks before the Spitfire was discovered. Shortly before he passed away he is even said to have told his wife ‘I wonder whatever happened to my Spitfire'. Steeped in history: A technician with the propeller of the restored Supermarine Spitfire (pictured left) at the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, Cambridgeshire, and pilot Ken Wilkinson (right), who is photographed with the Spitfire that he flew during the Second World War . Second World War Spitfire pilot Ken Wilkinson posed next to the Mark 1 aircraft at the Imperial War Museum earlier today. The Spitfire, one of the last of its kind remaining, is due to be auctioned for charity on July 9 and is expected to fetch up to £2.5million . Donation: The plane was bought by American billionaire philanthropist Thomas Kaplan after it was discovered in 1980. He had it restored to its original condition and now plans to donate the proceeds from the sale to the RAF Benevolent Fund and wildlife charity Panthera . The Spitfire P3974 after its restoration . Originally built at the Vickers Armstrong factory in Southampton, Spitfire P3974 was delivered to 92 Squadron at RAF Croydon in March 1940, one of the most celebrated squadrons in the RAF. The Merlin III engine installed in P9374 was built at Rolls-Royce, Derby, on October 27 1939. During Spitfire P9374's service with 92 Squadron it is known to have been flown by at least eight different pilots, and was almost certainly flown by the squadron's commanding officer Squadron Leader Roger Bushell, later 'Big X' of the Great Escape fame. Records show that P9374 had a total flight time of 32 hours and 5 minutes at the time of its loss. Eventually the plane was bought by American billionaire philanthropist Thomas Kaplan, who had it meticulously restored to its original condition by a team of expert engineers. Mr Kaplan, an Oxford-educated gold trader, owns both of the surviving Mk1 Spitfires. He has now listed the plane Cazenove piloted for sale through London auctioneers Christie's UK, 75 years since the Battle of Britain, with an estimate of £2.5 million. He plans to donate the proceeds to the RAF Benevolent Fund and wildlife charity Panthera. The other Mk1 - N3200 - will be gifted to The Imperial War Museum Duxford. Mr Kaplan said: 'When my great childhood friend Simon Marsh and I embarked upon this project, it was to pay homage to those who Winston Churchill called The Few, the pilots who were all that stood between Hitler's darkness and what was left of civilization. 'These coming events are more than anything else, concrete gestures of gratitude and remembrance for those who prevailed in one of the most pivotal battles in modern history. 'The return to Duxford of N3200 which was itself piloted by the heroic Commander of RAF Duxford, is an act of love for Britain that began with my and Simon's mutual passion for aircraft and desire to enshrine a British legacy.' He added: 'The sale of P9374 for charity is likewise an opportunity to share that passion with others and to benefit causes that have moved me since boyhood. 'The RAF Benevolent Fund represents a way to honour that breed who gave so much for Britain when its existence was imperilled.' John Romain, pilot and chief engineer at the Aircraft Restoration Company which undertook the project, said the original Spitfire is a remarkable piece of Second World War history. He said: 'We have restored it over the last five years. It came to us quite literally in boxes of parts that had been removed from the beach in France. 'We spent five years restoring it back to its original state - it is unique in that sense. 'We have seen Spitfires at auction before, but many years ago. This one is particularly special, it is very unusual to see a Spitfire like this go to auction. 'It was a special project for me to be involved in.' Experts say the plane offers a unique insight into the skirmishes Allied pilots faced. Robert Copley, Christie's UK deputy chairman, said: 'Christie's is proud to be entrusted with the sale of this Spitfire; a truly iconic aircraft which is symbol of the bravery of The Few in the Battle of Britain'.

Records show that the P9374 Spitfire (pictured left and right) had a total flight time of 32 hours and 5 minutes at the time of its loss . When Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring asked his flying ace Adolf Galland what he needed to win the Battle of Britain, he replied: ‘A squadron of Spitfires.’ The plane was so feared by the Luftwaffe that many Nazi crews claimed to have been shot down by one when they had really been downed by the slower, more numerous, Hurricane. The first plane shot down by a Spitfire was an RAF Hurricane in 1939 in a friendly fire incident known as the Battle of Barking Creek. After D-Day, flying ace Johnnie Johnson organised a supply run of Spitfires with barrels of beer slung under each wing to bring the ‘necessities of life’ to pilots on front-line airfields in Normandy. Spitfires were occasionally painted pink to blend in with the sunset and sunrise when used for low-level reconnaissance flights. Its pilot, Mr Cazenove, who came from a banking dynasty, was part of the ill-fated bid for freedom from Stalag Luft after he had been captured by German forces. He did not manage to get away as he was a big man who couldn't fit in the escape tunnel - which probably saved his life. Mr Romain said: 'He got involved in the Great Escape, but luckily for him he didn't escape that day. Most of his colleagues who did were then shot. 'He came back to the UK after the war.' Spitfire P9374 is now flyable once more and will take to the skies again at IWM Duxford in the VE Day Anniversary Air Show on May 23 and 24. 'We have restored 18 Spitfires over the years but have never been asked to restore one to such an exacting standard,' Mr Romain added. 'I've done the test flying and it was beautiful to fly. It really is a beautiful aircraft. It has flown at Duxford and people there started calling it ""the ballerina"", and that nickname has stuck.' Mr Kaplan said he embarked on the project because he wanted to 'enshrine a British legacy'. Robert Copley, deputy chairman of Christie's UK, said: 'Christie's is proud to be entrusted with the sale of this Spitfire; a truly iconic aircraft which is symbol of the bravery of The Few in the Battle of Britain. 'We look forward to seeing this extraordinary Mk.1 Spitfire reach new heights at The Exceptional Sale, which will be a unique moment in auction house history.'

"Jailed for life: Naunihal Singh woke up his daughter-in-law’s father and slashed him with a kitchen knife . A Sikh optician who slit the throat of his daughter-in-law’s father who was in bed after a drunken family row has been jailed for life. Naunihal Singh, 54, woke up great-grandfather Ujjal Singh, 63, and slashed him with a kitchen knife at his son and daughter-in-law’s home. The attack  in Crumpsall, Manchester, came after a heated argument over the couple's lack of children - with  Ujjal accusing Naunihal's son Yawinder-Pal ‘Monty’, 37, of 'firing blanks'. Today, Naunihal was jailed at Manchester Crown Court for at least 17 years and 39 days after admitting murder. The court was told that at the time of the killing last November, Naunihal and his wife Jaswant, who live in India, were paying a visit to Monty, and their daughter-in-law Balvinder, 42. Also there were Balvinder’s parents Jaginder and Ujjal from Ipswich, Suffolk - and the latter became angry at Monty for the couple’s failure to have children - accusing him of ‘firing blanks’. After an afternoon in the pub and an evening meal, Ujjal went to bed - but tensions escalated and Monty smashed a photo frame with his hand, which saw relatives take him to hospital. As Ujjal lay in bed, Naunihal sat at the kitchen table drinking vodka before taking a kitchen knife from a drawer. He then went into the bedroom, grabbed Ujjal’s jaw and slit his throat. When the family returned from the hospital and found Ujjal’s blood-soaked body, an ambulance was called where one paramedic noticed Monty move the knife and told police. Monty was soon arrested on suspicion of murder. Great-grandfather: Murder victim Ujjal Singh (front right) with his daughters (back row, from left) Tipta Kaur-Singh, Shakuntla Kaur-Singh, Piaro Kaur-Singh, Sindy Kaur-Singh, and (front left) his son Amolak Singh . Naunihal had already fled with his passport and tickets to fly back to India from Birmingham Airport - and got all the way to the terminal where he asked about changing his flights. It is believed he was then told of Monty's arrest and later handed himself in. Two days after the killing, he walked into a Manchester police station, where he said: ‘My son is innocent, I’m guilty.’ While demonstrating a ‘slashing’ motion, he added: ‘I’m guilty, I got the knife and I cut him like this... you let my son go. I love my son.’ Mark Kellet, prosecuting, said: ‘During the evening, Monty and Balvinder cooked dinner for the family. Monty, the defendant and Ujjal continued to drink. ‘(That) evening, the atmosphere became more argumentative. They argued about money and the fact that Monty and Balvinder did not have any children, with Ujjal blaming Monty for this. ‘As the argument developed, the exchanges became heated. Jaswant and Jaginder tried to calm Ujjal down and he was taken to bed. Jaginder went upstairs and put him into his pyjamas. Scene: The attack in Crumpsall, Manchester, came after a heated argument over the couple's lack of children . ‘Monty then smashed a photograph frame and his hand was bleeding. Balvinder, Jaswant and Jaginder took Monty to hospital for treatment on his hand, which was bleeding. 'As Monty and the others left, the defendant said: ""There is going to be a price to pay for the loss of your blood"". The group arrived at the hospital at about 11.10pm and returned home just after 1.10am. When they returned, Jaginder went into the bedroom to check on her husband to find blood around his neck and a knife on his chest. Ujjal was pronounced dead in hospital one hour and 20 minutes later. While at the house, paramedic Adam Wain saw Monty move the knife from the bedroom and informed the police, who subsequently arrested him. Naunihal handed himself in to police the following day where he told an officer that the police ‘had the wrong man’. 'Awful incident': Senior Investigating Officer Bob Tonge (centre) of Greater Manchester Police speaks outside Manchester Crown Court today with Ujjal's family. He said the case is 'tragic from start to finish' In interview, he said he took the knife into the upstairs bedroom where Ujjal was sleeping ‘to scare him’ because he had been abusive about his son. He later told officers Ujjal was on his back on the bed, staring at him. He told police: ‘I don’t know what I did. And now when I hear all these things, then I realise that maybe I have killed him. ‘He was scaring me with his eyes and he was swearing at me so... and he was coming at me and I just did like that and it just happened very quickly... and I was scared and he was bleeding.’ Mr Kellet said: ‘He stated that he was angry with Ujjal so took a knife from the kitchen to scare him. When he was in the bedroom, he was scared by Ujjal’s eyes. ‘Ujjal sat up in bed and somehow came into contact with the knife. He said that he panicked because of the blood and left the house. His passport and tickets to fly from Birmingham Airport were coincidentally in his coat pocket.’ Return journey: Naunihal had already fled with his passport and tickets to fly back to India from Birmingham Airport (above) - and got all the way to the terminal where he asked about changing his flights . After the case Senior Investigating Officer Bob Tonge of Greater Manchester Police said: ‘This case is tragic from start to end and what should have been a normal family gathering ended in absolute tragedy. ‘Two families have been destroyed by this awful incident, which basically stemmed from a family argument and was fuelled by alcohol. ‘While alone with the victim, and feeling slighted and offended by comments directed at his son, Naunihal Singh callously went into Ujjal Singh’s room and without a second thought, stabbed him as he slept. ‘He then fled, leaving his son, daughter-in-law and her family to discover his heinous crime. ‘The one saving grace is that he has not subjected them to further torment by making them endure a trial and has faced up to his crime and subsequent, inevitable punishment.’ In a statement Ujjal’s family said: ‘A true testament to his character was his ability to interact with his elders, his peers and also the younger generation that he was surrounded by. ‘He will be fondly remembered by all his family, he will never be replaced and never be forgotten.’ Ujjal was also described by relatives as a 'well-respected member of the Sikh community', while the court was told that the death had 'rocked the Sikh community in the area'.","Naunihal Singh stabbed great-grandfather Ujjal Singh with kitchen knife .

"A woman whose designer crocodile-skin handbag was seized by the UK Border Force has triumphed in a test case bid to get it back. The £2,000 designer tote bag, hand-made in Japan, was a 50th birthday gift for Hampstead woman, Sabine Smouha, from her husband Jeremy, the director of an investments company. But, when it arrived in Britain in 2013, customs officers confiscated it because Nile crocodiles are a protected species and it didn't have the right documentation. High end: A £2,000 designer tote bag, hand-made from Nile crocodile skinin Japan by exclusive designer Hikiji . The Border Force has repeatedly refused to return it to her, because it it did not have the required endangered species import permit. Now, however, Mrs Smouha - who said she was 'very sad to lose her birthday present' - has been handed victory by a tribunal judge. Judge Anne Redston said the crocodile was farmed and Mrs Smouha had relied on the reputable Japanese manufacturer to get the formalities right. She had acted entirely honestly and the Border Force's repeated refusal to hand over the bag was irrational and disproportionate. The judge said Mrs Smouha's birthday was approaching and her husband wanted to buy her a special present. She spotted the 'very pretty bag' on the website of elite Japanese handbag maker, Hikiji. The black bag, complete with bronze cowhide lining and matt gold finishings, was the creation of top designer, Mayumi Kondo. Her husband paid $3,400 for it and it arrived in the UK by express mail, in time for Mrs Smouha's happy day. Sabine Smouha was handed a victory at the Royal Courts of Justice, left, after a two-year battle. Judge Anne Redston ordered UK Border Force to reconsider their ruling on a designer handbag made from Nile crocodile, right, that they confiscated on the grounds that it was not imported with the right documentation . The bag was made from the skin of a Nile crocodile, a protected species under the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). But it didn't have the required documentation and customs officials seized it at the international mail hub, in Coventry. Representing herself, Mrs Smouha told the First-Tier Tribunal at the Royal Courts of Justice that she had been told by Hikiji that import formalities would be 'taken care of'. Endangered species are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Countries all over the world have signed up to the agreement imposing special responsibilities on anyone importing any of the hundreds of plant and animal species listed in the convention . It's designed to stop the illegal killing of these species by destroying the market. It applies to anything from that species, such as skin, fur and teeth . Under British and EU law, you must apply to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for a permit before importing anything on the list . When something is imported, it must also have a permit proving it was sourced legally by the country of export . Without these documents, your items can be confiscated by customs officials - but you have the right to appeal . There is also other international legislation applying to the trade of endangered species. Some can impose fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars and carry jail terms . It was the first time that the Japanese company had exported to the UK, but she was unaware of that. The crocodile skin, which had been farmed 'in a controlled environment' in Zambia, was legally imported into Japan before being re-exported. Judge Redston said: 'She was very sad to lose her birthday present and had done everything she could to remedy the position'. She had even offered to 'pay a reasonable fine' so long as the bag was returned to her. Ruling in Mrs Smouha's favour, Judge Redston said the Border Force had failed to consider the individual facts of her case. The skin had not been smuggled into the UK in defiance of CITES and Mrs Smouha had 'reasonably relied' upon Hikiji, whose duty it was to obtain an import permit. The judge added: 'Mrs Smouha did not ignore CITES. She communicated with Hikiji and understood that CITES had been complied with. 'She is not in business and the bag was a birthday present. This was her first experience of CITES. 'The bag cost $3,400 and she did everything she could to rectify the position after she realised the mistake. 'Mrs Smouha acted honestly and in good faith throughout'. Judge Redston gave the Border Force six weeks to reach a fresh decision in the light of her ruling.","The bag was a 50th birthday gift from her investments manager husband .

"NBA star Kevin Love, who dislocated his left shoulder on Sunday, has criticized his opponent for what he called a 'bush-league' play. Cleveland's power forward was injured in the first quarter of the Cavaliers' 101-93 victory that completed a four-game sweep when he and Boston's Kelly Olynyk chased a loose ball into the left corner after Jae Crowder of the Celtics missed a 3-pointer. Olynyk's right arm became entangled with Love's left arm. Love then grabbed his arm and kept running toward the Cleveland bench before going to the locker room, where he iced his shoulder. Olynyk was charged with a non-shooting foul. Scroll down for video . Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love injured his left shoulder during the first half in game four of the first round of the NBA Playoffs against the Boston Celtics on Sunday . Photos appeared to show that Love was dragged by the arm by Boston Celtics center Kelly Olynyk during the first quarter resulting in an injury that forced the Cavaliers forward from the game . 'I thought it was a bush-league play,' Love said after the game while wearing a sling. 'I have no doubt in my mind that he did it on purpose,' Love said. 'Olynyk was in a compromising position, had no chance to get the ball, and it was just too bad that he would go to those lengths to take somebody out of a game.' Boston coach Brad Stevens didn't think Olynyk hurt Love on purpose. 'That's not the type of person he is,' Stevens said. 'I hope Kevin's OK to play, whenever they play next, because you want everybody out there to finish the game.' Love said he intends on returning to the playoffs this season and wants the NBA to review the play. 'Oh, the league will take a look at it,' he said, 'and it better be swift and just.' 'I thought it was a bush-league play':  Love, left, has been openly critical of opponent Olynyk following the incident . The Cavaliers said Love would return to Cleveland with the team and receive additional examination, imaging and evaluation at Cleveland Clinic Sports Health over the next 24 hours before his status is updated. Love averaged 18.3 points in the first three games and scored the first basket Sunday. The Cavaliers would be off until at least Saturday before opening the Eastern Conference semifinals against either Chicago or Milwaukee. The Bulls lead that series 3-1.

"Archaeologists  have uncovered a ritual burial of 2,000-year-old human skulls - sparking the theory they could be the remains of Boudicca's rebels - as the London Crossrail excavations continue. The latest discovery of cremated human bones packed neatly into a cooking pot and set off at the side of the historic River Walbrook, in London, has experts questioning whether they were part of a gruesome ceremony. When about 20 skulls were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary in 2013 it had been thought that they had got there down stream after being eroded out of a Roman cemetery to the north - but new evidence suggests otherwise. Scroll down for video . New find: Around seven human skulls (pictured) dating back nearly 2,000 years have so far been found as part of the latest discovery by archaeologists at the London Crossrail site near Liverpool Street station . Roman rummaging: One of the skulls (left) was uncovered next to a Roman road which has also been found. A piece of Roman figurative pottery (right) was also dug up during searches of the site . Digging for history: A cross-section of the Roman roadside ditch uncovered at Liverpool Street station . The estimated age of the human remains and the way they appear to have been disposed of has led to the suggestion that the bones could even be Boudicca's rebels. Scientific tests are continuing on the cremated remains, with the possibility the grim ritual theory may be confirmed and that most of the seven skulls found so far are heads of  executed criminals and rebels. A spokesman for London Crossrail confirmed the team was working up a number of theories. He said: 'We don't have any answers yet but we are looking into it.' The Boudiccan Revolt raged from 60-61AD and saw British tribes, under Boudicca of the Iceni, unsuccessfully try to defeat the Roman army. Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who lived in what is today Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. The revolt resulted in Camulodunum, now Colchester, London, and Verulamium, now St Albans, being burnt to the ground while thousands of people on both sides lost their lives. A spoon from the Tudor period (left) was unearthed from a deep ditch, along with leather fragments (right) A spokesman for London Crossrail confirmed the team was working up a number of theories for the latest finds, which included cremated human bones packed neatly into a cooking pot . 'No answers': Archaeologists have uncovered a ritual burial of 2,000-year-old human skulls - sparking the theory they could be the remains of Boudicca's rebels. The bones are to be sent away for further analysis . A long needle believed to be from the Roman period was also dug up. It will now undergo scientific tests . Revolt: Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who tried to defeat the Roman army . The Boudiccan Revolt raged from 60-61AD and saw British tribes, under Boudicca of the Iceni, unsuccessfully try to defeat the Roman army. Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who lived in what is today Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. Her name is an early for of the more commonly known name 'Victoria'. Her husband, Prasutagus, was ruler of the Iceni people, and the Romans allowed Prasutagus to continue as king, ruling on their behalf. But, when Prasutagus died, the Romans decided to rule the Iceni directly and they confiscated the property of the leading Iceni families. The Romans are also said to have stripped and whipped Boudicca, and raped her daughters. The revolt resulted in Camulodunum, now Colchester, London, and Verulamium, now St Albans, being burnt to the ground while thousands of people on both sides lost their lives. Colchester was the first target of the Boudiccan army and many of the townspeople were rounded up and sacrificed in nearby groves. The Crossrail team spokesman said a connection was not currently being made between the skulls from 2,000 years ago and Boudicca's rebels but the possibility has not been ruled out. Work to excavate 3,000 skeletons from Bedlam burial ground, at the site of the new Liverpool Street station that will serve the cross-London rail network, has now been completed. It took a team of 60 archaeologists four weeks, working six days a week, to remove the remains and record evidence for what may prove to be, in archaeological terms, London's most valuable 16th and 17th Century cemetery site. Among the skeletons discovered at the burial site - used from 1569 until at least 1738, including the Great Plague in 1665 - were a mother a her child buried side-by-side. They have now been transferred to the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA). It took a team of 60 archaeologists four weeks, working six days a week, to remove the 3,000 skeletons previously found in the Bedlam burial ground, at the site of the new Liverpool Street station . Scientific tests are continuing on the cremated remains, with the possibility the grim ritual theory may be confirmed and that most of the seven skulls found so far are heads of executed criminals and rebels . Different theory: When 20 skulls were found in the River Walbrook it had been thought they got there down stream after being eroded out of a Roman cemetery to the north - but new evidence suggests otherwise . A close-up look of the Roman needle found as part of the archaeological digs . A decoration thought to be from the Tudor period was among the historic finds near Liverpool Street station . Crossrail workers are in the process of building a new ticket hall above the burial site - also known as Bethlehem and the New Churchyard - which was opened after graveyards around London started to overflow. It was used to bury London’s poor and religious non-conformists as well as patients from Bethlem Royal Hospital - the first dedicated psychiatric institution in Europe. Workers are now digging through medieval marsh deposits and Roman remains including a road that runs under the site. Archaeologists are expected to finish on site in September, after which construction will proceed on a new eastern ticket hall. Speaking last month, Jay Carver, Crossrail lead archaeologist, said: 'This excavation presents a unique opportunity to understand the lives and deaths of 16th and 17th century Londoners. One of the human skulls unearthed as part of the London Crossrail archaeology project . The Boudiccan Revolt raged from 60-61AD and resulted in Camulodunum, now Colchester, London, and Verulamium, now St Albans, being burnt to the ground while thousands of people on both sides lost their lives . New find: The Crossrail team said a connection was not currently being made between the skulls and Boudicca's rebels but the possibility has not been ruled out. The skeleton above was found at an earlier date . Careful work: The excavation of 3,000 skeletons (pictured) from Bedlam burial ground, at the site of the new Liverpool Street station that will serve the cross-London rail network, has now been completed . Crossrail workers are in the process of building a new ticket hall above the burial site - also known as Bethlehem and the New Churchyard - which was opened after graveyards around London started to overflow . 'The Bedlam burial ground spans a fascinating phase of London's history, including the transition from the Tudor-period city into cosmopolitan early-modern London. 'This is probably the first time a sample of this size from this time period has been available for archaeologists to study in London. 'Bedlam was used by a hugely diverse population from right across the social spectrum and from different areas of the city.' The Museum of London Archaeology is undertaking the archaeological excavations at Liverpool Street  on behalf of Crossrail. Scientific analysis of the remains will help provide new insights into the lives and deaths of early modern Londoners. So far, Crossrail has found more than 10,000 artefacts spanning many years of London's past across more than 40 construction sites. It is the UK's largest archaeology project. In 2013 and 2014, preliminary excavations at the Liverpool Street site in 2013 and 2014  uncovered more than 400 skeletons and numerous artefacts. The Crossrail project has already unearthed a number of exciting discoveries, including more than 10,000 artefacts at more than 40 construction sites. In 2013, workers made an 'unexpected and fascinating discovery' in tunnels underneath Liverpool Street Station, where the historic River Walbrook flows. The Crossrail team unearthed about 20 Roman skulls which were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary. The Crossrail team unearthed Roman skulls in 2013, which had been buried in clusters at Bedlam . Working under the direction of archaeologists, the construction workers carefully removed the human skulls, as well as a collection of ancient Roman pottery. For safety reasons the archaeologists had to leave the work to the tunnellers as the skulls were buried as deep as six metres below ground. The discovery of the skulls and pottery was made below the site of the historic Bedlam burial ground. Bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th century. Historically, Roman skulls have been found along the Thames tributary Walbrook during various excavations in the region. Prior to the discovery of the Roman skulls, workers also found about 4,000 skeletons buried in the Eldon Street area. These skeletons were found in August 2013 and were carefully removed during major archaeological excavations last year .","Seven human skulls, nearly 2,000 years old, have so far been uncovered .

"These two Australian dogs have got talent! A pair of border collies were caught on camera performing a balancing act. Using a human as their base, pooches Ace and Holly stood up high on their hind legs, with their front paws up. Scroll down for video . Here we go! Border collie Ace is seen on top of his owner and trainer Dai Aoki's lap . Don't forget about me! Soon, Holly the border collie hops onto Aoki's legs . The brief clip, set to  'Les Toreadors' from 'Carmen,' first shows a man, identified as their owner and trainer Dai Aoki, lying on the ground with 22-month-old Ace on his lap. Soon, Aoki puts his legs in the air - and 28-month-old Holly hops on. Once Holly is up, Aoki stretches his hands up toward the sky. Soon enough, Holly and Ace stand up solely on their hind legs - and hold the pose for several seconds. This isn't the first time the dogs have shown off their skills. Aoki's Instagram page and YouTube pages feature multiple videos of Ace and Holly doing tricks. Aoki also works as a dog trainer, and runs the Waterloo, Australia-based company Positive Dog Care. Neat trick: The trio are seen performing their stunt together . Ta-da! Holly and Ace finish the trick by standing on their hind legs . Family: Ace (far left) and Holly (far right) are seen with their owner and trainer, Dai Aoki. Aoki runs the Waterloo, Australia-based dog training company Positive Dog Care . Puppy Tales pointed out that the TV show 'The Living Room' deemed Ace Australia's Smartest Dog in 2014. Aoki told the website in January 2015: 'I only use positive reinforcement in the training that I do. 'And, equally importantly, I always have fun with my dogs. 'I actually don’t really use the word ""training"" – we are just having a good time together and learning new things.' Aoki also told Puppy Tales: 'I have had a few dogs in my life and I have never learned properly about dog training. 'With Holly and Ace, I wanted to spend quality time with them and have happy long lives together, so I undertook a course on Canine behaviour.' 'The most important things in training your dogs are consistency, patience, respect and love,' Aoki revealed to the website.

"The National Trust has replaced antique furniture with beanbags at one of its historic homes in an ‘experiment’ which has enraged heritage experts. Furniture dating back to 1820 was moved from the library at Ickworth House in Suffolk earlier this year and replaced with four brown leatherette bean bags. The move was designed to encourage visitors to ‘dwell and take in the atmosphere’ in the room but it provoked fury from heritage expects who branded the move ‘misguided’. The National Trust has replaced antique furniture with beanbags in the library of Ickworth House, Suffolk . Now it has emerged that similar experiments will take place at nine other of its venues around the country. Art historian Bendor Grosvenor, whose blog post on his Art History News site about Ickworth sparked the controversy, told The Independent: ‘I suspect the hoo-ha about the beanbags may at least cause them rethink what they were going to do. The National Trust said the beanbag experiment was 'short-term' Pictured: Ickworth House, Suffolk . ‘I don’t think you’ll ever bring in a new audience by talking down to it. Experimentation and bringing in new audiences are marvellous but there are better ways of doing it by taking away things people might want to see. It’s patronising nonsense.’ The National Trust’s director of strategy, curatorship and external affairs Simon Murray told The Art Newspaper that the Trust ‘presents each house in context’ and that each is different and treated appropriately. He said: ‘We are not a museum that takes objects, shows them in a display case, shines a light on them and labels them’. But he said this meant that ‘many visitors find a vast array of objects in front of them, cast a cursory eye over them and don’t get a great deal from the experience.’ He said the beanbag experiment was a short-term arrangement which would not necessarily continue for the whole year. But he added: ‘Some of our staff think we should have used a rather different sort of seating and others think it is good as an experiment.’","Four brown leatherette bean bags placed in library at Ickworth House .

"A hedgehog sniffing around in the dusk was once a common sight - but experts warn it may soon become a thing of the past. One in five people have never seen a hedgehog in their gardens, according to a wildlife survey. And of those who do spot the tiny animals, only a quarter see them frequently, the RSPB found. The startling figures confirm fears that the small British mammal is suffering a huge decline. There are thought to be less than 1 million hedgehogs living in this country today, an estimated 30 per cent drop since 2013. One in five people have never seen a hedgehog in their gardens, according to a new wildlife survey . Part of the reason is the widespread loss of the traditional hedgerows that used to line every country road. But the loss of bushes and hedges in back gardens is also thought to have played a role in the animal’s demise. Mark Eaton, conservation scientist at the RSPB, said that the popularity of hard wooden or metal fences has made it hard for hedgehogs to move from place to place. As they become isolated in smaller and smaller areas of greenery, they cannot feed or mate. ‘A few decades ago there were tens of millions of hedgehogs in Britain, now we think there are maybe 1 million left,’ Mr Eaton said. ‘Most of the reason is down to the change in the way we manage our countryside - the loss of hedgerows and woodlands has removed their habitat and the increase in the use of pesticides has removed a lot of the beetles and other animals they feed on. ‘But there are concerns about the way we garden as well. ‘Hedgehogs have to make their way through the maze of back gardens, trying to find gaps in fences. ‘It doesn’t matter if you have a garden with the most juicy hedgehog food, with lots of slugs and worms - if you fence them out, they are not going to get in.’ Part of the reason is the widespread loss of the traditional hedgerows that used to line every country road . Cutting holes of just a few inches - about the size of a CD - is enough for a hedgehog to get through a fence, experts say. More than 420,000 people provided information about the wildlife in their back garden as part of the RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Some 65 per cent said they had seen a hedgehog in the last year - but only 28 per cent saw them once a month or more. Some 20 per cent of participants had never seen a hedgehog in their garden. People were more likely to see a non-native grey squirrel than native hedgehogs, with squirrels spotted in 74 per cent of gardens at least monthly throughout the year. Red squirrels, which have been lost from large parts of the country, were seen at least monthly in just 2 per cent of gardens. Conservationists are worried that once-common snakes are also vanishing. Six out of ten people reported they had never seen a grass snakes and half had never seen a slow worm, another variety of snake. Daniel Hayhow, RSPB conservation scientist, said: ‘Despite remaining widespread in many areas of the UK, important habitats for slow worms and grass snakes have been lost. ‘As gardens become tidier, reptile homes have been lost, leaving a shortage of habitats in which to live and breed. Piles of logs, compost heaps and ponds provide ideal warm, sheltered environments for these species to breed, find food and to hibernate.’ Henry Johnson, hedgehog officer for the People’s Trust for Endangered Species, urged people to take steps in their garden to help hedgehogs find food and shelter. He said: ‘Spotting animals is just the start. For more people to see hedgehogs in the future, we need more holes in fences, joining up gardens, and more insect-friendly gardening.’","One in five people have never seen a hedgehog in their back gardens .
