"During the 19th century Inuits in Greenland would have entertained polite company in their settlements while wearing a thong made of seal fur. Traditionally known as a 'naatsit', the underwear is adorned with beads and would have been sewn together by a woman using strips of seal pelt. It is currently on display at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen as part of its animal-skin clothing collection. Traditionally known as a 'naatsit', the underwear (pictured) is adorned with beads and would have been sewn together by a woman, for a woman, using strips of seal pelt. It is currently on display at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen as part of its animal-skin clothing collection . Peter Toft, the National Museum of Denmark's Greenlandic fur clothing expert, told Ella Morton at Atlas Obscura the underwear would have been worn inside the homes of the Inuit - even in front of guests or when visiting family members. It was obtained during an expedition to the Ammassalik settlement in Greenland in 1892 by Captain C. Ryder. When leaving the settlement, the female wearer would have worn it under trousers. The naatsit was the only undergarment the Inuit would have worn next to their bare skin and it was often decorated with beads of glass, with the seal fur turned outside. Example have also been decorated with small pieces of fur in different colours. It was obtained during an expedition to the Ammassalik settlement in Greenland in 1892 by Captain C. Ryder. When leaving a settlement, the female wearer would have worn this naastit (pictured) under trousers . Seals are found along the coast of East Greenland and are hunted by Inuits (stock image) for their meat and skin. Seal fur provides less insulation than caribou fur to prevents the wearer from sweating and causing the material to become damp, and later freeze in the cold . Cunera Buijs from the National Museum of Ethnology said: 'When weather conditions permitted, the naatsit was often the only garment worn, both in the home and outside in the settlement.' These homes would have been built to keep in the heat, with a low corridor entrance positioned in such a way to cause warm air to rise from beneath the structure into the home, and stay there. In addition to the naatsit, the National Museum of Denmark's collection also features a diaper made from reindeer fur (pictured) Many of these primitive buildings would have housed more than one family. 'There does seem to have been a taboo against walking around outside the home only in shorts,' continued Ms Buijs. 'As soon as the Inuit men left their own settlement, they put on a pair of long trousers made of seal or polar-bear fur.' Seals are found along the coast of East Greenland and are hunted for their meat and skin. Inuits across the region, and into North America and Siberia, would have also made garments from the skin and fur of reindeer and caribou. The severe conditions of the region means that clothes have to protect against the cold, wind and damp and seal fur, in particular, provides less insulation than caribou fur. This prevents the wearer from sweating and causing the material to become damp, and later freeze in the cold, continued Mr Toft. Women would clean the skin and remove all traces of flesh to prevent them from rotting, a pricess called 'flensing'. The fat would be scraped away on a board called a qapiarpik and the clothing would have been sewn together using a sakkeq or ulu - a traditional woman’s knife - and a needle. The display also contains a pair of pantyhose made from reindeer skin and fur (pictured). A similar collection is on display at the National Museum of Ethnology, which came via the museum in Copenhagen . In 17th century Iceland, sorcerers wore 'trousers' made of a dead friend's skin that were said to bring them wealth (example pictured) In 17th century Iceland, sorcerers wore 'trousers' made of a dead friend's skin that were said to bring them wealth. According to legend, a morbid deal was struck between two friends to arrange who became the trousers or 'necropants,' which were used for purposes of traditional magic at the time. The Museum of Icelandic Sorcery & Witchcraft in Holmavik, Iceland, houses the only known intact pair of necropants, that were meant to be worn day and night by their owner. In order to make the necropants (called nábrók in the naive tongue) an individual had to get permission from a living man to use his skin after his death. The surviving member of the pact had to dig up his dead friend's body and peel off the skin of the corpse from the waist down in one piece without any holes or scratches, to make the magical trousers. As soon as they stepped into the pants, the skin of the corpse stuck to theirs own, according to the museum, which documents 17th century occult practices. To make the grim garment, the wearer of the pants had to steal a coin from a poor widow at Christmas, Easter or Whitson and place it in the scrotum of the trousers, along with the magical sign called nábrókarstafur, which is drawn on a piece of paper. The coin is a 'tool to gather wealth by supernatural means,' according to the spokesman. It drew money into the scrotum from living people so 'it will never be empty' as long as the original coin is not removed, according to folklore. Many of these techniques and tools are used today. When Europeans arrived in East Greenland from the end of the 19th century they introduced new materials, and modern-day garments are often a mixture of old techniques and newer fabrics. In addition to the naatsit, the National Museum of Denmark's collection also features a diaper and a pair of pantyhose made from reindeer skin and fur. A similar collection is on display at the National Museum of Ethnology, which came via the museum in Copenhagen. During the 1930s, Dutch biologist and Nobel Prize winner, Niko Tinbergen, lived in East Greenland and collected objects of ethnographic interest. He donated an East Greenland kayak and two kayak anoraks to the museum of ethnology. Many other items were provided by Gerti Nooter from the 1970s who conducted research in North America and the arctic region. This includes hunting equipment, and clothing.","Garment is part of an animal-skin  display at National Museum of Denmark .

"The health watchdog that damned the NHS's first privately run hospital ignored a spot check by its own inspectors that found huge improvements in standards. The vital findings have been suppressed for nearly four months, and have only emerged now after the Care Quality Commission quietly revised its report to rate many of the hospital's services as 'good'. In January the commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate' and placed it in special measures, along with a dozen of the worst hospitals in the country. But today the watchdog will upgrade this to 'requires improvement' and publish a glowing report. In January the commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate' Experts say it is further evidence that the inspection was flawed and a stitch-up by Labour Party activists and trade unionists who oppose privatisation. The new version of the report rates the hospital as 'good' in 18 out of 33 criteria that were assessed including its outpatients departments and overall standard of end-of-life care. It also praises a number of the hospital's departments and individuals as 'outstanding' including its maternity ward, intensive care unit, specialist children's nurse in A&E and the chaplain. Crucially, the report – a draft of which has been leaked to the Mail – shows that the CQC ignored a second, far more positive spot check of the hospital when it published its initial report. In January – a week before the first report came out – inspectors returned to check up on two wards where they had raised concerns about standards of care during a visit in September. They found major improvements and praised nurses for treating patients with dignity and respect, responding promptly to call bells and ensuring patients were not in pain. Yet the watchdog ignored these findings when placing the hospital in special measures. Hinchingbrooke – which serves 160,000 patients in Huntingdon – was controlled by the private firm Circle from February 2012 until last month. NHS patients were treated there as usual but Circle – rather than NHS managers – was in charge of the day-to-day running of the hospital and its budget. The firm was praised for driving down waiting times, lowering the death rate, reducing infections and improving overall care. After January's report Circle announced it would be withdrawing from its contract. The hospital is now being run by the NHS Trust Development Authority. The rating of 'requires improvement' in the revised report moves the hospital from the bottom 13 per cent of hospital trusts in the country to an average score, which is achieved by 59 per cent of organisations. Today the watchdog will upgrade the 'inadequate' finding to 'requires improvement' and publish a glowing report . The Mail has repeatedly highlighted concerns by MPs and doctors that the inspection was flawed and a sabotage attempt by those opposed to privatisation. One of the inspectors was a member of the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public. Another was a senior figure in the British Medical Association, the doctors' trade union, who had previously spoken out about the dangers of private firms' involvement in the NHS. Neither took part in the spot checks a week before January's report. Tory MEP David Campbell Bannerman said: 'This is an extraordinary procedure and raises serious questions about how the CQC goes about its inspections. 'It's an admission by the watchdog that its first inspection report was over the top and far too tough. It's all been heavily influenced by the public service unions. I will be writing to the Health Secretary to demand a full investigation into whether this was a stitch-up.' A spokesman for Circle said: 'This vindicates our view that the inspection of Hinchingbrooke was flawed. The evidence has always been that Hinchingbrooke was a good hospital, with low mortality rates, low waiting times, and positive reviews from other NHS regulators.'","The Care Quality Commission damned the NHS's first privately run hospital .

"Dashcam footage has revealed the startling moment a Texas trooper ran toward a motorcyclist following a high-speed chase, leaped into the air and karate kicked him to the ground. The unconventional maneuver led to a three-day, unpaid suspension for Trooper Abraham Martinez last year but the footage only emerged this week as the Austin American Statesman investigated outdated tactics used in Department of Public Safety pursuits. The incident unfolded in December 2012 after Martinez, a 10-year veteran trooper, took chase when 25-year-old Steven Gaydos ran a stop sign near Houston. Gaydos knew he was being pursued but drove off because he was driving on a suspended license. Jump: Trooper Abraham Martinez is seen leaping into the air to kick Steven Gaydos after he fled from authorities in Houston in 2012 as he drove in a suspended license . Contact: Martinez was ultimately suspended for three days without pay for the unconventional tactic . 'I took off, thinking I could easily lose him,' he said in a later interview. But troopers followed Gaydos for nearly 40 miles at speeds of 130 mph before Martinez pulled alongside him and fired four times through the window of his moving car, striking the man once in the thigh. The motorcyclist then raised his hand and pulled over and, as he tried to put down his kickstand, Martinez suddenly leaped out at him, kicked him and knocked him to the ground. Gaydos was arrested for evading law enforcement, driving with an invalid license and possessing a prescription painkiller after he was found to be carrying two Percocet pills. The Statesman reported that the kick and shooting from a moving vehicle don't specifically violate the Texas Department of Public Safety rules for high-speed chases, but experts said that shooting at fleeing suspects was an area of the policy that needed updating. Knocked down: After the kick, Gaydos fell to the ground. Martinez had also shot him once in the leg . Surrender: Ahead of the kick, Gaydos could be seen raising a hand to troopers and pulling over . After the incident, Martinez said he pulled out his weapon to avoid harm coming to anyone else on the road and only intended to shoot Gaydos' tires. He did not strike the bike with any of the bullets. 'I knew that it was necessary to terminate the pursuit in order to avoid any more injuries or serious bodily injuries, possibly even deaths from happening,' he said in an interview with a supervisor. As for the kick, 'obviously we don't teach that,' he said. 'I think it's something that just comes natural to some of us.' He said he opted for the unusual move because experience taught him to act decisively in case the suspect was armed. In February 2013, a grand jury declined to indict Martinez for the shooting but he was eventually ordered to take three days off last summer for violating DPS policy by using force inconsistent with his training, the Statesman reported. Both men have declined requests to comment. Caught: Gaydos, left in his mug shot, was arrested for evading law enforcement, driving with an invalid license and possessing a prescription painkiller after he was found to be carrying two Percocet pills . Suspension: Martinez, pictured right, was suspended without pay for three days last summer but was not indicted for the shooting after he said he was trying to prevent further injuries from occurring .","Trooper Abraham Martinez jumped into the air and kicked Steven Gaydos off his bike following a high-speed chase in Houston in December 2012 .

"Vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks, which can spread potentially fatal diseases to humans. Their warning comes after a survey found almost half of dog owners did not know that ticks can transmit deadly diseases to both humans and other dogs. Over half, 54 per cent, also confessed they did not know that Lyme disease, a potentially fatal illness caught from tick bites, affects their pets as well as themselves. Knowledge about Lyme disease is increasing and it is known to wreck lives. In extreme cases, the nervous system, joints and heart can be affected, and symptoms may be misdiagnosed as other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks, which can spread potentially fatal diseases - such as Lyme disease - to humans . At the other extreme, symptoms may be so mild that someone who's been bitten by an infected tick may experience only flu-like symptoms. Ticks, which flourish in long grass or undergrowth, typically attach to deer but can also be found on foxes, badgers, mice, birds as well as domestic pets - responsible for carrying the ticks into urban areas - and humans. Areas of undergrowth (including parks and gardens - as well as woodland and open country) are most likely to harbour ticks as they drop off their original hosts then climb to a point where they can latch on to other passing wildlife. It's why most people are bitten below the waist. With the forecast of increasingly damp winters and hotter summers - ideal conditions for the ticks to thrive - as well as growth in deer numbers, the concern is that the incidence of Lyme disease will rise further. Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. Ticks are tiny spider-like creatures found in woodland and heath areas. They feed on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans. Ticks that carry the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease are found throughout the UK and in other parts of Europe and North America. Ticks that carry the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease which can infect humans . Many people with early-stage Lyme disease develop a distinctive circular rash at the site of the tick bite, usually around 3 to 30 days after being bitten. This is known as erythema migrans. Some people with Lyme disease also experience flu-like symptoms in the early stages, such as tiredness (fatigue), muscle pain, joint pain,headaches, a high temperature (fever), chills and neck stiffness. More serious symptoms may develop several weeks, months or even years later if Lyme disease is left untreated or is not treated early on. These can include: . Some of these problems will get better slowly with treatment, although they can persist if treatment is started late. A few people with Lyme disease go on to develop long-term symptoms similar to those of fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. This is known as post-infectious Lyme disease. Source: NHS Choices . The increase in incidence of illnesses such as Lyme is 'a serious' cause for concern and 'ticks will become a very serious public health issue in the UK as a result of climate change', claims Julie Barratt, the director of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health. She thinks we need to take a similar approach to avoiding tick-borne disease as we do to sun exposure - covering up and using insect repellent as we would sunscreen. This means taking precautions 'in the great outdoors, whether you're camping, walking in the countryside or in your back garden', she says. Concerned vets across the UK are now urging people to get their dogs checked out for the pests. Any ticks collected by vet practices will be sent to a team of scientists who will examine them for Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. Professor Richard Wall, from the University of Bristol, will be part of a team studying the ticks, and says their numbers have soared in the last 10 years. He said: 'Current evidence suggests that many tick-borne diseases in northern Europe are increasing in prevalence as a result of factors.' He explained this is due to changes in their habitat, increasing pet travel and climate change. He added: 'Warmer and wetter winters and milder wetter summers, in particular, may allow the normal highly seasonal pattern of tick activity to be extended, giving more continuous periods of exposure. 'In Great Britain the distribution of ticks is estimated to have expanded in the last 10 years by 17 per cent and the abundance of ticks to have increased at 73 per cent of locations surveyed.' Many people do not realise it is possible to catch Lyme disease in Britain. Joanne Drayson, from Guildford, who contracted the illness after being bitten by an infected tick while walking her dog, did not know it was possible to catch it in the UK. She said: 'I was aware of the disease but always thought it was something that was unique to the United States. 'After a long course of antibiotics, I gradually recovered my health. I still enjoy walking in the woods but now I go more prepared. 'It is important to cover up, tuck your trousers in your socks, have long sleeves and when you leave the woodland or countryside to always check for any ticks.' Public Health England estimates the number of new Lyme disease cases each year at around 3,000, while charities say the figure is closer to 15,000. In spite of this, the majority of people are still unaware that the potentially debilitating condition also affects dogs. Lyme disease is caused by a bite from an infected tick. Dogs can become bitten during walks in wooded areas or parkland in both urban and rural areas. Symptoms in dogs include lameness, lethargy and fever, which, if left untreated, can lead to more serious conditions such as kidney disease and heart failure. Many cases of Lyme disease are likely to go unnoticed by owners as they are only detected by a thorough examination. Throughout spring and early summer when ticks are most actives, vets taking part in The Big Tick Project, will be giving dogs visiting their practice a tick check. Ticks collected will be sent off for scientific analysis where they will be examined for Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. The Big Tick Project is being launched by TV presenter Chris Packham who wants to raise awareness of the risks and symptoms associated with Lyme disease . The project is being launched by TV presenter Chris Packham and aims to raise awareness of the risks and symptoms associated with the tick-borne disease. He said: 'Research suggests that ticks are a growing problem whether that's urban parkland to woodland and open country. 'Living as I do in the New Forest where ticks can be a problem and present a real threat to my dogs, this project is close to my heart and could be important in advancing both for canine and human health. 'I know people who have contracted the disease and I cannot begin to imagine how I would feel if my dogs were to catch it too. 'While I find ticks interesting creatures, I don't want them on my dogs, in my house or on me. 'If like me, you love your dogs, you'll want the best advice and treatment to help reduce the risks associated with ticks and tick-borne disease. 'I know I can get this by talking to a vet with access to the latest innovative and effective products available to help tackle this issue.'","Vets have launched the Big Tick Project urging owners to get pets checked .

"Teenagers across America got a very realistic simulation of a prom night drinking and driving crash and from the looks of their aghast faces it seems as though they learned their lesson. The Glasford school in Illinois hosted one of several simulations put on by the American Red Cross to educate students on the dangers of drunk driving. The staged event on Thursday used student actors playing accident victims and used real local police, fire and rescue personnel responding to the scene, reports The Journal Star.

Playing dead: Illini Bluffs High School senior Alanni Young stands Thursday as American Red Cross Central Illinois Chapter employee Lisa Maynard adds a touch of realism before a simulated prom night  accident . In attendance at the event and clearly troubled was an Illini Bluffs High School senior named Moriah Nau who wiped her tears away as she was embraced by her friend. Nau's brother, Austin, died at age 17 in a 2011 non-alcohol-related automobile accident. Playing one of the injured students was Alanni Young who was sprayed with makeup that realistically looked like blood. Playing the drunk driver in a tuxedo was Illini Bluffs High School senior Sam Giftos who stumbled out of the vehicle with fake blood dripping down his face as beer cans lined the street. In the simulation, actual firefighters removed one of the injured passengers, senior Jule Hemp, in a stretcher and a neck brace.

Bloodied: Alanni Young prepares to simulate a fatal car crash on Thursday evening in Illinois . In a graphic staged performance on Wednesday at Massapequa High School in Long Island, students showed other students just what kinds of things could happen if a driver decides to drink before getting behind the wheel. A young man ran to the windshield of a crashed car where a 'dead' woman was slumped over and covered in blood. The man in the tuxedo was playing the role of a drunk driver who rammed his car into another vehicle, injuring six others including his prom date. Realistic rescue: Firefighters remove senior Jule Hemp, playing the role of an injured passenger, from the simulated prom night fatal automobile accident at before high school students on Thursday . 'Thank God it’s not real,' said Kelly Hastings, who played the dead woman, told CBS. 'I couldn’t imagine seeing a scene like that, although I couldn’t see it because I was participating in it. I just pray to God it never happens to anyone else.' The drunken driving crash simulation didn't end at the collision. Real first-responders came to the scene with their sirens blasting. Fire trucks, ambulances, and even medevac helicopters took the actors playing victims away as though they were truly hurt. 'We’re actually showing first-hand what a motor vehicle accident looks like from start to finish,' said Massapequa fire fighter Stuart Paolino. Injured victim: 'Thank God it’s not real,' said Kelly Hastings, who played the dead woman, told CBS . The simulation was Paolino's idea and he hopes it will scare teenagers out of drinking and driving. The man who played the drunk driver, Brian Bernhard, was escorted off the scene in handcuffs. Bernhard told CBS even though it was just a simulation, he felt absolutely terrified and hopes that no one has to go through a drunken driving arrest. 'It felt like the real thing,' he said. 'It certainly, certainly was no joke; very real.' Students who witnessed the gruesome play acting were left with stunned expressions on their faces. It was a little scary to see what could actually happen, and it hit me,' said Massapequa High School junior Jacob Liese. 'This simulation, along with consistent reinforcement of the importance of healthy choices, is an invaluable opportunity to positively impact our students in our fight against DWI and other destructive decisions,' said Lucille F.

"While teenagers continue to post often-horrifying photos of the unpleasant side effects they’ve experienced after using a lip suction cup to give their lips a Kylie Jenner-esque boost, one male beauty blogger took steps to look even more like the 17-year-old reality star in a new video tutorial. Rolly Robinson, from the blog Beauty High, stars in theunique makeover clip, which sees him transform himself into a Kylie Jenner lookalike with the help of various make-up products and - of course - the infamous lip suction cup. To make himself over as 'America's sweetheart', Rolly first had to shave his mustache - and then he got to work using an impressive array of cosmetics to help him copy the appearance of the youngest member of the Kardashian clan. Scroll down for video . Just like Jenner: Beauty High's Rolly Robinson, left, transforms into Kylie Jenner, right, in a new makeup video tutorial . Pre-pout-puffer: Rolly did a remarkable job turning himself into a Kylie lookalike; before makeup, the editorial designer had normal lips, no cleavage, and a mustache . 'I decided to start the base off really light and build on top of it as I move along,' he says while starting to apply make-up to his face, rubbing color onto his cheeks. The editorial designer advises that viewers use a cosmetic sponge like one by Beauty Blender for a natural, seamless look. 'When contouring your nose, you want to make sure you really refine those edges so it doesn't look super duper sharp,' he continues while layering on highlighters and bronzers to create a slimming effect favored by almost all of the Kardashian sisters. 'You want to make sure nose looks as smooth and natural as possible.' Rolly also uses contouring on his chest, shading in circular motions to create the appearance of cleavage. Keeping up with cosmetics: The 'makeover guru' started off by applying a light base coat of make-up to even out his skin before contouring his face with darker and lighter pigments . Tricky beauty tools: Rolly used the controversial Fullips plumping suction cup, which teens around the country have been trying with some disastrous results - many of which are posted on social media . Moving onto the eyes, Rolly says: 'When putting on your [false lashes], make sure that you bend the lashes before you apply the glue. That way, it has the shape of the curve of your eye. And then when you place it, you just lightly press and hold.' He then uses a white eye pencil on his waterline, the sliver of skin between the eye and the lower lashes, which is a trick that he says will 'widen your eyes'. Finally, for Kylie's famous pouty lips, Rolly uses the controversial Fullips lip suction cup on his mouth for fifteen minutes in order to make his lips swell up and give the impression of a fuller pout. And while his use of the product successfully resulted in slightly plumper lips, teens across the country have been trying similar methods to make their lips look as big as Kylie's with disastrous results; many have experienced less favorable outcomes, with their lips swelling much more than they intended, while others, who have chosen to use other tools such as shot glasses, have cause permanent damage to their lips after accidentally shattering the glass around their mouths. Practically twins: After applying makeup and using the lip suction cup for fifteen minutes, Rolly, right, does a pretty good impression of 17-year-old Kylie, left . Social media makeover: The ultimate finish touch, Rolly puckered his pout and posed for a selfie a la Kylie at the end of the video . In fact, Kylie herself responded to the suction cup craze, writing on Twitter: 'I'm not here to try & encourage people/young girls to look like me or to think this is the way they should look. [sic]' Lucky for Rolly, the beauty expert seems to have mastered the Fullips device. Once his lips were plump, he overdrew them with a lip pencil like Kylie does, as extending the lip line creates a further illusion of fullness. While Rolly's edited video in less than three minutes long, the star herself recently revealed that her own beauty routine can last hours. 'A good night out is, like, two and a half hours for full makeup, curling hair, whatever,' Kylie told Teen Vogue. 'I'm never going to spend just 20 minutes, you know?'","Beauty High's Rolly Robinson uses a wig, contouring, and a Fullips suction cup to achieve Kylie Jenner's infamous big-lipped look .

"A St. Louis woman is doing all she can to stop the city from tearing down the house that has housed three generations of her family. Charlesetta Taylor, 79, has lived in her home for 70 years, and was a member of the first African-American family to live in her neighborhood, and now it and 49 others, may be bulldozed. This so the city can make way for a campus for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Scroll down for video . Charlesetta Taylor (above), 79, may have her home of 70 years torn down by the city of St. Louis . Taylor (above in the 60s) was part of the first African-American family in the neighborhood . 'We celebrated everything in here, and there was always something going on,' she said (above in front of the home) 'We were the first African-American family I know on this block and several other blocks around us,' Taylor told ABC News about her three-story brick residence. 'It was 1945, and there was a restrictive covenant restricting where African-Americans could live. But, nonetheless, my father was successful in buying this house for our large family.' That may all go away though, now that the city needs to keep the NGA, and the 3,000 jobs it provides, in St. Louis. The company creates maps and satellite imagery that is used by the military for national security, among other things. And if residents are not willing to move, the city says it will resort to eminent domain to take their homes. That would not just mean the loss of Taylor's home, but more importantly the loss of a lifetime of memories. 'We celebrated everything in here, and there was always something going on,' she said. 'During Christmas, dozens of kids would be here: all my siblings, cousins and, later on, their children and children’s children.' Taylor is pictured here at age 9 (in the upper right corner) with her siblings . The city may also tear down 49 other homes in addition to Taylor's (above) to make sure the NGA does not leave the city, and take the 3,000 jobs it provides . Taylor also pointed out that many of the other people who could lose their residences are elderly, adding; 'Our homes are not for sale.' A Change.org petition has been started, and already there are over 90,000 signatures. Three other sites are being considered and a decision is expected in March 2016.

"A recent meeting between a freshman Republican congressman from California and his constituents took an unexpected turn when Rep Steve Knight was caught on camera threatening an anti-immigration protester with violence. Knight, 48, a former Los Angeles police officer who was elected to represent the 25th Congressional District last year, was hosting an open house event at his Simi Valley office last Friday when he was accosted by a group of activists rallying against amnesty for undocumented immigrants. The heated exchange between Knight and the group of protesters carrying anti-immigration signs was captured on video and later uploaded onto YouTube by a right-wing group called We The People Rising. Ambush: Rep Steve Knight (left) was accosted by activists rallying against amnesty for illegal immigrants outside his Simi Valley, California, office during an open house last Friday . Crossing a line: A man named 'Mike' (right) accused Knight of lying about his voting record and patted him on the back after a prolonged handshake . Tempers flare: Knight, a former LAPD officer, went after Mike, telling him, 'If you touch me again, I'll drop your a**' Defense: Knight went on to explain to the activists that he never voted in support of ‘amnesty’ for immigrants . In the 2-minute clip, Knight is approached by a man who introduces himself as 'Mike' and proceeds to shake the lawmaker's hand at lenght. During the awkward encounter, Mike informs Knight: 'You told me you didn't vote for amnesty and you did. I looked it up on the Internet. You lied to me.' Voting record: Knight was one of 75 House Republicans who voted to pass a bill funding the Department of Homeland Security after it had been stripped off provisions blocking Obama's immigration reform . The protester then gives Knight a pat on the back and tries to walk away, but the lawmaker calls after him, grasps his upper arm and says: 'If you touch me again, I'll drop your a**.' Following the foul-mouthed remark, the former cop-turned-lawmaker goes on to explain to the activists that he never voted in support of ‘amnesty’ for immigrants, saying there were several versions of the same bill, known as HB 240, and he voted for the one that did not have the provisions supporting President Obama’s immigration reform. The bill that sparked the verbal spat outside Knight’s office was the subject of a protracted legislative tug-of-war between Democrats and Republicans in Congress two months ago. Right-wing lawmakers originally had inserted amendments into a bill providing nearly $40million in funding for the Department of Homeland Security to block President Obama's immigration reforms. After Senate Democrats successfully blocked the bill, 75 House Republicans, including Knight, gave in to prevent a shutdown and passed a ‘clean’ bill stripped off all provisions seeking to obstruct Obama’s executive orders on immigration, and thus lifting the threat of deportation against millions of undocumented immigrants. In the videotaped conversation with the protesters Friday, Knight insisted he never voted to support Obama's immigration reform. Knight, a US Army veteran, was elected to the US House of Representatives last November . House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio administers a ceremonial re-enactment of the House oath-of-office to Rep.  Steve Knight R-Calif., accompanied by his his wife Lily Knight and family, January 6, 2015, on Capitol Hill . ‘I never voted for amnesty. Never, ever,’ he said. Knight, a US Army veteran and married father of two, spent 18 years on the LAPD force before being elected to the California State Assembly in 2008. Two years later, he became a state senator and in 2014 was elected to the US House of Representatives. Following the release of the video, Knight put out a statement Tuesday apologizing for his conduct. ‘I have dealt with this group on several occasions and every time they try to escalate our conversations to a level that is not constructive,’ Knight said. ‘Over this past weekend, I lost my cool and I regret responding the way I did.’ The group that staged Friday’s protest, Save Our State, has been accused of having ties to white supremacists, reported Politico. In 2010, Save Our State organized a demonstration in California during which a local city councilman sparked an outrage by referring to himself as a ‘proud racist.’ Mea culpa: Following the release of the video, Knight (pictured with his wife and two sons) put out a statement Tuesday apologizing for his conduct .","Rep Steve Knight representing 25th Congressional District in California was confronted by activists from right-wing group Friday .

"A terrifying image reveals the moment a 'highly skilled' pilot spun out of control during an aerobatic display - right before the plane crashed in front of horrified spectators this afternoon. Smoke billows from David Jenkins' single-engine Edge 360 plane above Old Buckenham Airfield near Attleborough, Norfolk. The man in his 50s tragically died when it crashed just 50 metres from a group of people who were at a press day for the air show. A friend who wished to stay anonymous said: 'He was the best bloke I knew. He was highly skilled and knew exactly what he was doing.' Mr Jenkins was a member of the Wildcat Aerobatic Team based at Old Buckenham Airfield and has been a regular competitor at UK aerobatics competitions, winning over 40 medals. Scroll down for video . Terror: A terrifying new image reveals the moment David Jenkins' plane spun out of control - before crashing at the Old Buckenham Airfield .

Disaster: The single-engine Edge 360 plane was being put through its paces when it crashed in flames at Old Buckenham Airfield near Norfolk (pictured) Eyewitnesses saw the plane go into a flat spin and failing to come out if it during its display at around 2.45pm. Witnesses said that the burning wreckage of the plane was extinguished by firefighters. Lauren Cope, a reporter for the Eastern Daily Press who was at the press launch, said: 'It's very quiet here and everyone is very emotional.' Mr Jenkins was named British Advanced Champion in 2012 and 2013 and a member of the UK team at the 2012 aerobatic world championships. According to his profile on the Wildcat's website, he began flying as a teenager living near Panshangar airfield near Welwyn Garden City. A pilot who flew out of the airfield this morning said he only found out about the tragedy when he returned this evening after being diverted elsewhere. Simon Garrett said: 'We were due to land back here but were sent elsewhere because of this emergency. 'We didn't know anybody had died until now. It is a terrible tragedy and very unusual because the teams involved are highly skilled. I knew the gentleman involved and he was very experienced.' A Norfolk Police spokesman said that 'sadly the pilot of the aircraft died at the scene' and his next of kin has been informed. An area of the airfield has been cordoned off - most probably overnight - while the investigation is handed over to the Air Accident Investigation Branch and a file prepared for the coroner. Emergency: A local resident says she knew something bad had happened when she heard police sirens rushing to the airfield .

"Outrage: SNP leader Alex Salmond, pictured, was caught boasting in secret footage . Alex Salmond has provoked outrage after he was caught boasting: 'I'm writing Labour's budget.' Secret footage showed the former first minister, who is bidding to become an MP, mocking Labour after it slapped down its Scottish leader Jim Murphy, who claimed he would write the party's budget north of the border. 'I knew that [he wouldn't be writing it] already – because I'm writing the Labour Party budget,' Mr Salmond declared to cheers at a fundraising event. He also joked that he would 'check his top pocket' – a reference to a Conservative election poster showing a miniature Mr Miliband in his breast pocket. It prompted David Cameron and Boris Johnson to join forces to warn of a looming 'constitutional crisis'. They questioned the legitimacy of the SNP's plan to try to put Ed Miliband in Downing Street, even if Labour wins fewer seats at the Election. Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister had tweeted the footage of Mr Salmond with the message: 'This footage will shock you: Alex Salmond laughs & boasts he'll write Labour's budget. Vote Conservative to stop it.' Mr Cameron, in his first joint interview with the London Mayor, his chief rival to the Tory leadership, said: 'In the last 48 hours the SNP have said 'no money spent on defence projects unless you get rid of Trident'. 'No HS2 unless it starts in Scotland'. 'You have now got Salmond saying he wants to write Ed Miliband's budget. That's before this has even happened. Imagine how much worse it would be, imagine how many pockets would be picked if this were to happen. 'The stakes at this election have always been high. It's about sticking with a plan that's working or risking it with Ed Miliband. But frankly the stakes have got much higher because of what's happening in Scotland with the SNP potentially wiping out Labour. 'The way to avoid that outcome which would be unstable, bad for the economy, bad for jobs, bad for living standards, bad for this country's prospects, the way to avoid it is to vote Conservative.' The London Mayor, deployed to inject more passion into the Tory campaign, claimed it would mean 'truckfuls of taxpayers' dosh growling up the M1 to Scotland'. 'Lots of people ... people who might even have voted Labour ... will think that this is a constitutional crisis,' he added. Mr Johnson, who is seeking to return to the Commons in the West London seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, also said a Labour government dependent on the SNP's support would be 'totally shambolic'. The SNP has declared it will never support the Conservatives in a hung parliament, but it is ready to do a deal with Labour, even if it finishes in second place. It would be the first time since 1924 that a second-placed party had formed a government. Mr Miliband dismissed Mr Salmond's claim in the footage as 'fantasy and nonsense'. But he again refused to rule out relying on SNP votes in a hung parliament. Alex Salmond boasted that he would write Labour's first budget because the SNP would hold the balance of power . Mr Salmond also joked that he would 'check his top pocket' – a reference to a Conservative election poster showing a miniature Mr Miliband in his breast pocket (pictured above) 'We are going to be writing the first Labour budget,' he told BBC Radio Five Live. The Labour leader insisted he had no plans to negotiate, adding: 'I am going to put a Labour Queen's Speech before the Commons and people will have to decide how they vote.' Mr Miliband also accused Mr Cameron of 'trying to stir up English hatred against the Scots' by highlighting the threat posed by the SNP's Left-wing agenda. Responding to the leaked footage, Mr Salmond said Mr Cameron should 'try holding a few public meetings and meeting real people – and develop a sense of humour'. Former SNP leader Alex Salmond has boasted that 'whoever holds the balance holds the power' in Parliament . The video of Mr Salmond's remarks came after David Cameron tweeted the footage online earlier today . The Prime Minister said Labour had not ruled out a deal with the SNP and would be held to 'ransom' by Mr Salmond . 'The point made in a light-hearted way was that Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy had been slapped down by his party bosses at Westminster and told that he would have no role in a Labour budget,' Mr Salmond said. 'David Cameron is clearly a prime minister with both a people bypass and a sense of humour bypass.' It came as Nicola Sturgeon, Mr Salmond's successor, set out another policy demand for the entire UK, saying that SNP MPs would vote for a £24billion increase in NHS spending. Last night, Labour deployed former prime minister Gordon Brown, who claimed the only way Mr Cameron can win the election 'is to build resentment in Scotland of the English and resentment in England of the Scots'. However, he also warned that an SNP surge could lead to 'months of constitutional chaos'. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was out campaigning today in the Portobello area of Edinburgh where she posed with a sign highlighting her hope of a hung parliament . Ms Sturgeon has called for an increase in government spending of some £148billion and demanded her MPs have a say over the running of the whole of the UK, raising the prospect of Scottish nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border. EU bank warns of Labour risk to UK jobs . By Hugo Duncan, Economics Correspondent for the Daily Mail . A Labour government propped up by the Scottish nationalists could be 'bad news for growth and jobs', one of Europe's biggest banks warned last night. Analysts at ING said that in return for helping Ed Miliband get into No.10, the SNP would push for more public spending and even another referendum on Scottish independence. According to the bank, this could dent global investors' confidence in the UK 'as questions are raised over the durability of the country as it stands'. The report also claimed that a referendum on Britain's future in the EU – as promised by the Conservatives – 'throws up concerns regarding trade'. 'Both the future of Scotland and its relationship with the rest of the UK together with the UK's future relationship with the EU are issues that are causing concern among investors,' said James Knightley, senior economist at ING. Mr Knightley said Britain has attracted more foreign direct investment than any other EU country in recent years – a crucial driver of growth. 'Political and economic uncertainty from the election means this could change, which would be bad news for growth and jobs,' he added.","Alex Salmond has been filmed mocking Labour's weakness in Scotland .

"Like hundreds of thousands of others, model and TV personality Jesinta Campbell was a fan of wellness blogger Belle Gibson and followed her inspirational story of cancer survival. But after Gibson finally admitted she faked her multiple cancer diagnoses – following months of speculation and the undoing of her health empire – Campbell has joined the chorus of angry followers who say they feel insulted by her deception. 'I am so disappointed and shocked and on every level, this is so irresponsible on her behalf,' Campbell said on the Today Show on Thursday morning. 'I was actually at an awards ceremony - the Cosmopolitan Fun Fearless Female Awards - and she was awarded with one of the big awards there. 'And she was on stage and she was giving this speech, and she was crying, and I was crying, and I just feel like she's really let everyone down. 'It's just so irresponsible. I followed her on her blog, on her app, it's really disappointing.' Scroll down for video . Jesinta Campbell (right) says she shed tears with Belle Gibson (left) at the Cosmopolitan Fun Fearless Female Awards last year. They are both pictured at the event . Belle Gibson pictured at the awards with Sunrise host Samantha Armytage in November last year . The controversial wellness blogger has finally admitted she faked her multiple cancer diagnoses . Model Jesinta Campbell has joined the chorus of angry followers who say they feel let down by Belle Gibson . In a magazine interview, Belle Gibson has admitted her fatal cancer 'diagnoses' were lies. 'No. None of it is true,' she said, during a series of interviews published in the latest edition of the Australian Women's Weekly. Ms Gibson's interview is published in this month's edition of the Australian Women's Weekly . In the interviews - which questioned her relationship with the truth and her understanding of cancer - Gibson said she was not seeking forgiveness. 'I don't want forgiveness. I just think (it) was the responsible thing to do. Above anything, I would like people to say, ""Okay, she's human"". Gibson's confession was the first time she has spoken publicly since - under fire from furious former fans - she told Daily Mail Australia she feared for her family's safety. On Thursday, Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia they were not investigating Gibson and the matter was being looked after by Consumer Affairs Victoria. In 2013, the wellness blogger became a prominent Australian social media personality after she announced she had cured a malignant brain tumour through diet and natural therapies. Her Instagram fan base ballooned after she 'revealed' she had prolonged her life by embracing an alternative lifestyle. Her Instagram fan base ballooned and her 'whole foods' business became hugely successful. Penguin published her recipe book The Whole Pantry and her app was to be offered on the Apple Watch. But it all fell apart last month after revelations emerged Ms Gibson had failed to fulfill promised donations to various charities. Friends then began to cast doubts about her cancer diagnoses. She then tearfully 'admitted' she may have been 'misdiagnosed' by a 'Dr Phil'. 'I am so disappointed and shocked and on every level, this is so irresponsible on her behalf,' Campbell said on the Today Show on Thursday morning . Ms Gibson revealed the truth of her cancer diagnosis in an interview . The magazine article claims Gibson is due to meet with her publisher Penguin Books - which incurred a number of losses when the company was forced to withdraw her book and cancel overseas launches - but a company spokesman said there was no meeting planned. 'We are disappointed that, despite several requests for clarification regarding recent ­allegations made against her, Belle is yet to res­pond to us ­directly,' a spokeswoman said. 'We have read with interest her recent interview and are considering our rights and options as set out in our agreement with her.' The  Weekly insists it did not pay for the story and that it was approached by Ms Gibson's 'people', the Melbourne 'corporate advisory' firm Bespoke Approach. Ms Gibson said her partner, Clive Rothwell, was sticking by her in spite of the controversy. But she said he had taken a 'stern' line with her and insisted she play a straight bat. 'He's been very stern, along the lines of, 'I just want you to acknowledge where you've f***ed up and try not to smooth over that,' she was quoted saying. In the article, titled 'My Lifelong Struggle With The Truth', Ms Gibson also said she had been forced to raise herself from the day she started school. Ms Gibson, pictured kissing her son on the head, said: 'None of it was true' Her business empire in tatters and her relationship with her fans broken, Ms Gibson is thought to be struggling financially. The Women's Weekly said she was not paid for her interview . She said she took upon common household responsibilities, such as bringing her brother to school and making lunches. But she would not provide her mother's name or contact details to the magazine. In her previous interview, Ms Gibson said she understood 'everyone's anger and confusion'. But she took aim at many of her former fans who she believed had responded 'maliciously' - claiming that her son's childcare details, home address and floor plan were published online. Former friends had called upon Ms Gibson to 'come clean' with the truth about her situation and had long privately questioned the veracity of her story. A former friend of Ms Gibson directly called on her to 'come clean' in an interview with Daily Mail Australia in March. Mother-of-two Jayme Smith, 28, from Sydney, became a confidant of Ms Gibson's after they met on a parenting discussion page on Facebook around 2010. The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) was also a popular app. It will not appear on the Apple Watch any longer . They forged an online friendship and confided over their experiences with cancer - Ms Smith having lost her mother to lung cancer in 2003 and Ms Gibson saying she had brain cancer. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia last month she was 'baffled' when reports emerged this week where friends raised doubts about Ms Gibson's medical diagnoses and charity donations. 'I am just so shocked and I feel betrayed, that we all fell so hard for the illusion that she created,' Ms Smith said. 'It has hit all of us, who I know, (who) also know Belle, like a tonne of bricks.' 'We only knew her online, but we all believed to a point that she was a genuine pioneer, who was surviving aggressive cancer. 'Belle and I talked quite a bit about my feelings about (cancer), how she could empathise with me, the feelings I felt about my mother dying and how I'd wished I was more responsible when it happened, that I'd wished I had tried to explore more ideas, like Belle did.' Ms Smith said Ms Gibson 'pushed' - and nearly convinced her - not to vaccinate her children, but that she did not blame her for nearly making that choice, which she 'backed out of at the last minute'. Jayme Smith (pictured left, with her two children) met Belle Gibson online and maintained a friendship over social media until they had a falling out . 'That was my own choice, based on information provided by Belle. I regret that choice (to nearly not vaccinate), but it was my own. I'm not here to place blame.' In November 2014, Ms Gibson told Sunday Style magazine she blamed the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil for her cancer. She told her social media followers last year her brain cancer had spread to her blood, liver, spleen, uterus and that she did not expect to survive. After friends and medical experts cast doubt on her medical claims, Ms Gibson told The Australian she may have been 'misdiagnosed'. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong,' she told the newspaper, adding that she was 'confused, bordering on humiliated'. Ms Smith said of Belle Gibson (above): 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want'","Wellness blogger Belle Gibson has finally admitted she never had cancer .

"A former SS sergeant described how so many Jews were brought to the Auschwitz death camp at once that he was put on a 24-hour shift guarding the ramp where they disembarked from the trains. He told in chilling detail how cattle cars full of Jews were brought to the Auschwitz death camp, the people stripped of their belongings and then most led directly into gas chambers. Oskar Groening is being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder, related to a period between May and July 1944 when around 425,000 Jews from Hungary were brought to the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex in Nazi-occupied Poland and most immediately gassed to death. During that period, so many trains were arriving that often two would have to wait with closed doors as the first was 'processed,' Groening testified at the Lueneburg state court.

Eva Kor (pictured) told of how she was never allowed to say goodbye to her mother who was dragged away from her as she arrived at the Nazi death camp . Groening told the court on Tuesday that he is 'morally guilty' but not directly responsible for any deaths . SS Sergeant Oskar Groening - known as 'the bookkeeper of Auschwitz' - is  on trial charged with complicity in the killing of 300,000 Jews at the Nazi extermination camp . Inhuman suffering: A photograph of the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops in 1945. Eva and Miriam Kor are shown holding hands in the very front . Recovery: Miriam and Eva Kor as shown in a 1949 photo. Eva Kor and her twin sister Miriam were among the 1,500 twins (amounting to 3,000 children) Dr. Josef Mengele experimented on in Auschwitz . Though he was more regularly assigned to the camp's Auschwitz I section, he said he guarded the Birkenau ramp three times, including one busy 24-hour shift. The main gas chambers were located at Birkenau. 'The capacity of the gas chambers and the capacity of the crematoria were quite limited. Someone said that 5,000 people were processed in 24 hours but I didn't verify this. I didn't know,' he said. 'For the sake of order we waited until train 1 was entirely processed and finished.' Auschwitz survivors describe their arrival as chaotic, with Nazi guards yelling orders, dogs barking and families being ripped apart. But Groening, 93, maintained the opposite, saying 'it was very orderly and not as strenuous' on the ramp at Birkenau. 'The process was the same as Auschwitz I. The only difference was that there were no trucks,' he said during the second day of his trial. 'They all walked - some in one direction some, in another direction... to where the crematoria and gas chambers were.' Survivor Kor asked Groening whether he knew details about files kept at the camp in hopes of learning more about what diseases she and her sister, who both survived, were injected with . Survivors from Auschwitz (pictured), who are plaintiffs in the case, travelled from the United States, Canada, Hungary and elsewhere to attend Groening's trial . Between May 16 and July 11, 1944, Groening was on duty when 450,000 Hungarian Jews were transported there, with 300,000 being gassed just after arrival. Pictured, Auschwitz survivors . No pleas are entered in the German system and Groening said as his trial opened Tuesday that he considers himself 'morally guilty,' but it was up to the court to decide if he was legally guilty. He faces between three and 15 years in prison if convicted in the trial, which is scheduled through July. Eva Kor, 81, was one of the Jews who arrived at Auschwitz in 1944. Though she doesn't remember Groening personally, she said she can't forget the scene. 'Everything was going very fast. Yelling, crying, pushing; even dogs were barking. I had never experienced anything that fast or that crazy in my entire life,' she told The Associated Press before addressing the court. Her two older sisters and parents were taken directly to the gas chambers, while she and her twin sister, both 10 at the time, were ripped away from their mother to be used as human guinea pigs for notorious  Dr. Josef Mengele's experiments. 'All I remember is her arms stretched out in despair as she was pulled away,' Kor remembered. 'I never even got to say goodbye.' Kor, who now lives in Indiana, is one of more than 60 Auschwitz survivors and their families from the U.S., Canada, Israel and elsewhere who have joined the trial as co-plaintiffs as allowed under German law.

Groening sits opposite Auschwitz survivors Hedy Bohm (left) and Eva Pusztai-Fahidi (right) at the court room in Lueneburg . General view of the cout before the start of the trial against  Groening . Thomas Walther, who represents many co-plaintiffs, said he and his clients were happy Groening agreed to testify, but suspected he was withholding many details. 'There is an ocean of truth, but with many islands of lies,' he said. Kor, the first co-plaintiff to address the court, described her experience Wednesday and asked Groening whether he knew Mengele or details about files he kept in hopes of learning more about what diseases she and her sister, who both survived the camp, were injected with. Groening showed no reaction to Kor's statement and his attorney, Hans Holtermann, said his client would try to answer what questions he could, but he didn't believe that Groening knew Mengele. Groening guarded prisoners' baggage on the ramps, but his main task was to collect and tally money stolen from the new arrivals and then send it to Berlin - a job for which the German press has dubbed him the 'Accountant of Auschwitz.' While he previously testified he was 'horrified' by individual atrocities he witnessed, he suggested Wednesday his daily thoughts were more pedestrian, like when the guards heard a train loaded with Hungarian Jews would be arriving. 'If this is Hungary, they have bacon on board,' he remembered thinking. Though he was investigated twice before and no charges were brought, Groening was indicted under a new line of German legal reasoning that anyone who helped a death camp function can be accused of being an accessory to murder without evidence of participation in a specific crime. Groening, who worked for an insurance company after the war, has testified as a witness in other Nazi trials. Outside court, Kor said she wished Groening would use the trial to try and dissuade 'misguided young people' today from becoming neo-Nazis but she was still satisfied with his testimony. 'I'm going to take whatever confession he gives - it's better than no confession,' she told reporters. 'Maybe this is the best thing he has ever done in his life. Isn't that sad?'","Oskar Groening is being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder .

"An eight-year-old boy penned a letter to health conscious Michelle Obama to tell her one ketchup packet at lunch simply is not enough. According to Peter's father, the letter submitted to The Weekly Standard took six-months to write because troubled Peter was  'too angry' to write it all down in one sitting. In addition to telling Michelle Obama that public school children can't live on one packet of ketchup alone, Peter criticizes the First Lady for America's lack of troops in the Middle East and in the Ukraine.

I also think you should stop doing nothing and go send some troops to the Middle East. I also think your husband needs to work on his speeches. He also disappointed millions of Americans by not bombing Syria. If you do not know thousands of peoples homes are destroyed by ISIS in the Middle East.

And, in keeping with news that William and Kate do not know the sex of their baby – the fourth in line to the throne, she adds: ‘It teams blue and pink together – perfect if you don’t know what sex the baby is.’ The cheapest item in the range is a £2.79 set of party cups. It also includes straws for £3.49 and cake bunting at £7.69. Mrs Middleton started Party Pieces at home more than 25 years ago and its success has made her a multi-millionaire. But it was criticised for bringing out tacky merchandise for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, such as Corgi-themed scratchcards. However, friends point out that the firm was set up years before the future king began dating Kate, and as head of one of Britain’s leading party goods suppliers Mrs Middleton would not be doing her job if she failed to mark major royal events.

"Ben Affleck is apologizing after it came to light that the Academy Award-winning actor and director asked that information be withheld from a PBS show about his family history. After appearing on Finding Your Roots and learning one of his ancestors was a slave owner, Affleck pushed the network to leave that information out of the program it was first revealed by DailyMail.com, a request the producers ultimately agreed to. This enabled Affleck to hide the identity of his ancestor, named today by The Sun as James McGuire, who kept eight slaves on his farm in Trenton in New Jersey in the 1840s. Today the actor apologized for asking producers to leave out the name in a post on Facebook, while also explaining his reasons for his decision. Scroll down for video . Ben Affleck has apologized after he demanded information about a slave-owning relative be withheld from a PBS show about his ancestry . Affleck took to Facebook to issue his apology . 'After an exhaustive search of my ancestry for Finding Your Roots, it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves,' wrote Affleck. 'I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth.' Affleck went on to say he lobbied for that information to be withheld after filming the episode. 'It's important to remember that this isn't a news program. Finding Your Roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family, making you quite vulnerable,' he explained. 'The assumption is that they will never be dishonest but they will respect your willingness to participate and not look to include things you think would embarrass your family.' He then added; 'I regret my initial thoughts that the issue of slavery not be included in the story. We deserve neither credit nor blame for our ancestors and the degree of interest in this story suggests that we are, as a nation, still grappling with the terrible legacy of slavery. It is an examination well worth continuing.' US genealogist Debra Fleming is said to have helped trace Affleck's family tree back to McGuire, a relative of his father Timothy. Ms Fleming told the Sun: 'There are lots of farmers in the family. Slavery didn't end in New Jersey until 1846.' Affleck is just one of the many celebrities once again under fire after WikiLeaks sorted all the hacked Sony emails into a system that makes them easier for the public to search. PBS meanwhile is conducting an internal investigation to determine if this omission violated the network's editorial standards. They have yet to release a statement on their findings. After an exhaustive search of my ancestry for ""Finding Your Roots,"" it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves. I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth. Skip decided what went into the show. I lobbied him the same way I lobby directors about what takes of mine I think they should use. This is the collaborative creative process. Skip agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices I disagreed with. In the end, it's his show and I knew that going in. I'm proud to be his friend and proud to have participated. It's important to remember that this isn't a news program. Finding Your Roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family, making you quite vulnerable. The assumption is that they will never be dishonest but they will respect your willingness to participate and not look to include things you think would embarrass your family.

We deserve neither credit nor blame for our ancestors and the degree of interest in this story suggests that we are, as a nation, still grappling with the terrible legacy of slavery. It is an examination well worth continuing. I am glad that my story, however indirectly, will contribute to that discussion. While I don't like that the guy is an ancestor, I am happy that aspect of our country's history is being talked about.

"A clean-water advocate took an Earth Day swim in New York City's polluted Gowanus Canal, a site designated by the federal government as especially polluted, but quit less than halfway through. Christopher Swain wore a protective yellow suit as he went over a railing and into the water around 2pm Wednesday in Brooklyn but completed only two-thirds of a mile of the 1.8-mile waterway. He swam about an hour into the canal in  a stunt to urge environmental clean up that ultimately succumbed to the water's pollution because the experience was like 'swimming 'in a dirty diaper'. Christopher Swain, a clean-water activist, embarked on a 1.8-mile swim in the toxic Gowanus Canal, which has been designated as especially polluted by the Environmental Protection Agency, to urge its cleanup . The swimmer, who quit two-thirds of a mile into the swim, gargled hydrogen peroxide periodically to prevent contaminated water from getting down his throat . Swain, who has previously swam the Hudson and Columbia Rivers, said that cleanup of the Gowanus Canal, which was labelled as a Superfund site by the EPA, should be accelerated . 'It's probably the safest move at this point,' he said, according to Reuters, but pledged to swim the whole canal one day. 'I want to make it clear, no one is telling me to stop,' Swain continued, and said that impending bad weather played a role in his decision. The activist said 'It's not safe to swim in there,' according to Gothamist. He said that the water tasted 'Like mud, poop, ground-up grass, detergent and gasoline'. The 19th-century canal was once a major transportation route, but it's now so polluted with industrial and sewer discharges that it must, by law, be cleaned up. The federal Environmental Protection Agency says contaminates include PCBs, which were banned in the US in 1979. It warned Swain against taking the swim, posting a message on its Twitter account saying that it 'strongly advises AGAINST swimming' in the strip of water. The agency issued guidelines in 2011 saying that people should 'never swim in the canal', which runs over 1½ miles through a narrow industrial zone near increasingly wealthy neighborhoods in Brooklyn. It urged anyone who came in contact with the water to seek medical attention immediately if they felt sick. Crowds gathered on bridges along the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn as Swain was accompanied by a woman in a red kayak . The activist has previously swam the Hudson River in New York and the Columbia River in Washington to bring attention to water issues . Swain waves to the crowds who came to see him swim but were disappointed when he only made it two-thirds of a mile. A baby whale once got lost in the canal in 2007 and died within two days . After heavy rainstorms excess water from the sewer system flows in the canal, where  raw sewage and human excrement that mixes into its normal mix of petroleum products and other chemicals. An estimated 377million gallons of diluted raw sewage pour into the canal each year. 'There's a lot of poop in there,' Swain said after his swim, according to the New York Post. Dissolved arsenic in the water is thought to be at a level 60 times higher than that harmful to human health. A baby whale became lost in the canal in 2007 and was nicknamed Sludgie by locals. It died in two days. After rainstorms it can often be found with raw sewage that mixes into its normal mix of petroleum products and other chemicals. However Swain, who has previously done long swims along the Hudson River in New York and the Columbia in Washington, wanted to call attention to the slow clean up of the canal and urge for it to be accelerated. An estimated 377million gallons of sewage is poured into the Gowanus Canal every year. Above, trash pollutes the Brooklyn inlet in 2013 . The pollution in the Gowanus Canal combines decades of industrial dumping and general trash. It is particularly filthy after rainstorms . He gargled hydrogen peroxide to fight against any bacteria entering his body and had charcoal tablet to take that will help if he did, according to CityLab. Swain told reporters after he got out that he did not swallow any water. He was accompanied by a woman in a kayak, paddling a few feet away from him before he called it quits. Swain posted on Twitter that swimming in the canal is his 'federal right' under the Clean Water Act of 1972. Gowanus was labeled a Superfund site in 2010, with the EPA later saying that cleaning it up would take up to ten years and $506million, according to DNA Info. Costs will mostly fall on the city and companies that used to be along the canal such as National Grid. The agency plans on beginning dredging in the canal in 2017, which involves cleaning out 600,000 cubic yards of contaminated mud. Before Wednesday's failed effort, Swain also planned on swimming other polluted waters, such as the Bronx River and Newtown Creek, which runs between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. He said he has hope that New York's polluted waterways will one day be clean enough for swimmers without protective suits. The water advocate claims that it is his 'federal right' to swim in the canal under the Clean Water Act of 1972 . Cleanup of the Gowanus Canal, where dredging of mud is scheduled to begin in 2017, is thought to cost $506million .","Christopher Swain donned protective suit to swim through Gowanus Canal .

"Carol Chandler at Southwark Crown Court to answer charges of historic sexual abuse . A female teacher accused of abusing a pupil at Chancellor George Osborne’s old school appeared in court today. Carol Chandler, 53, allegedly molested a boy, under the age of 14 who was a pupil at top independent school St Paul’s in Barnes, south west London, during the 1980s. She is facing three counts of indecent assault and two counts of gross indecency between 1983 and 1985. Chandler appeared at Southwark Crown Court in a mint green wool skirt suit, black court shoes and silver jewellery. The charges have not yet been formally put and Chandler has not entered pleas. Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC told Chandler: ‘Yes madam, you have heard the next important hearing date for the case is going to be on 9 July.’ He added: ‘I renew your bail until that date on the single condition that is obviously necessary and I am sure you wouldn’t dream of it anyway - not to contact directly or indirectly any prosecution witnesses.’ Occupying a 45-acre site beside the Thames, near Hammersmith Bridge, St Paul’s boasts facilities including a purpose-built art gallery and 230-seat theatre, which are second to none. Famous former pupils of the top school, established in 1509, include the Chancellor, who attended the £32,000-a-year school in the eighties, Mumford and Sons banjo player Winston Marshall and TV presenter Dan Snow.

"A SkyWest Airlines pilot plunged a plane carrying 75 passengers into a terrifying dive on Wednesday after a reported, potentially catastrophic loss of cabin pressure in mid-air. Frightened passengers held their heads and prayed as Flight 5622, operating as a United Express, dropped nearly 30,000 feet in eight minutes and made an emergency landing in Buffalo, New York. The situation arose about an hour after take-off, when three passengers on the Embraer 175 twin-jet from Chicago to Connecticut  lost consciousness and others began feeling dizzy and sick. When the plane landed, SkyWest initially claimed that the aircraft landed 'out of an abundance of caution' because of one sick passenger and denied there was any mechanical malfunction - which conflicted with reports from people on the plane. Late on Wednesday, the airline said new information from medical personnel confirmed that 'a total of three passengers reported a loss of consciousness while on the flight'. Scroll down for video . Emergency responders came onboard SkyWest Flight 5622 after it made an emergency landing in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday following a reported loss of cabin pressure . Mary Cunningham, a nurse, who was on board the flight assisted one passenger who passed out, getting her oxygen. She said that the plane did not land because of just one person's medical emergency as a lot of people on board began to feel dizzy and unwell . Passenger Frank Angelo said he immediately feared for the safety of his wife and kids as the plane 'nosedived' 30,000 feet in just eight minutes . 'You could feel something in the air, something just wasn't right,' recalled one passenger before the plane plunged miles in mere minutes. Passenger Larry Johnson, right, said: 'A lot of people with their heads down praying. It just felt like a re-enactment' Emergency nurse, Mary Cunningham, said she helped treat an unconscious passenger when another passed out beside her and others nearby started feeling faint. 'The flight attendant and myself started not feeling very well while we were in the middle of the flight helping out. I had to sit down. I was short-of-breath, light-headed [and] didn't feel great,' said Cunningham to NBC Connecticut. Initially, reports came in that a cabin door had opened during the flight, leading to dramatic loss in cabin pressure. When the plane landed at 11.40am, the FAA issued a statement saying the crew 'reported a pressurization problem and declared an emergency', shortly before landing in Buffalo. However, in a second statement the FAA put out on Wednesday afternoon, there was no mention of a 'pressurization' issue. When contacted by the LA Times to explain this, a spokesperson for the FAA would not say why the change was made. However, an official with knowledge of the incident told the LA Times that crew members did report that a door had come open at 38,000 feet and was causing 'rapid depressurization.' On landing this was declared untrue and SkyWest airlines said they were examining what happened on the aircraft midflight. SkyWest spokeswoman Marissa Snow said: 'There were no reports before the unconscious passenger prior to the initiated descent, but I can't speak to what may have been the specific cause of their feeling ill.' SkyWest added that there was no indication of any problems with the doors and that its mechanics were inspecting the aircraft. Nose dive: Emergency vehicles surround a SkyWest Airlines plane, operating as United Express, that made an emergency landing at Buffalo Niagara International Airport on Wednesday . Flight 5622, from Chicago to Hartford, made an emergency landing in Buffalo . Passenger, Dave Barkley, 46, told the LA Times that he was sat near the front of the aircraft and he saw a flight attendant race to the cockpit and tell the pilot passengers were falling unconscious. Suddenly, the pilot announced the plane was going to begin an emergency landing over Detroit. 'They said there was a pressure problem with the plane,' he said. 'There was no door flying open or anything like that. It was something very gradual.' Barkley said that while the passengers were calm, he was annoyed about with public statements the airline has made. 'The way SkyWest is reporting it is that someone got sick, and they had to land,' he told the LA Times. 'But the way we understand it, they got sick because of the lack of oxygen or lack of pressure in the plane.' A nurse flying on the Embraer 175 twin-jet described a growing sense of panic and hysteria as she herself began to feel ill while treating two women who had passed out. It was at that moment the pilot took decisive action and put the plane into a steep dive rather than take any risks. 'The passenger was lethargic. She was responding but her color was off. She didn't look good. We got her some oxygen. She was much more alert after getting the oxygen,' the nurse, Mary Cunningham, tells NBC Connecticut. Cunningham says she returned to her seat once the woman felt better. It was then when she says the woman sitting behind the first passed out, as well. Then Cunningham, herself, took a turn.

While another passenger said, 'you could just feel something in the air, something just wasn't quite right.' For nearly eight minutes, the plane descended at a very steep incline, dropping as fast as 7,000 feet per minute, while flying over Lake Erie, flight tracking service FlightAware said. The flight originated in Chicago and had been bound for Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. It landed at Buffalo Niagara International Airport in Buffalo at about 11:40 a.m. SkyWest Inc., which is based in St. George, Utah, said the jet landed safely and a passenger received medical attention before being released. An additional 15 adults and two children were evaluated upon landing, but none required treatment outside the airport, airport spokesman C. Douglas Hartmayer said. 'Anyone who said they didn't feel well was treated at the gate,' he said. 'We want to understand the circumstances and what SkyWest knows before we decide what, if any, action we would take,' said Kelly Nantel, spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board. Snow said the plane's oxygen masks did not release. According to WKBW, one passenger said the plane 'nosedived' and crew told fliers that there was a loss of cabin pressure, but that turned out not to be true. SkyWest has 29 Embraer 175s in its fleet. The aircraft seats 76 passengers with two flight attendants. In a statement, the FAA said: 'SkyWest Airlines Flight 5622, an Embraer E170 aircraft, landed safely at Buffalo International Airport at 11.40am after the crew declared an emergency.

"The mother of the man slain by Aaron Hernandez is moving forward with a civil lawsuit against him and her lawyer said the former New England Patriots player will be called to testify at the trial. Ursula Ward, the mother of Odin Lloyd, wants to look Hernandez in the eye when he testifies during the wrongful death suit. according to attorney Doug Sheff. Hernandez, who did not testify at his criminal trial and had a $40million contract, was convicted April 15 of first-degree murder for killing Lloyd on June 17, 2013. Scroll down for video . Suing her son's murderer: Ursula Ward, the mother of Odin Lloyd, at a press conference on Wednesday about the civil suit she has filed . Killer and his victim: Hernandez (left) was found guilty of first-degree murder parole in the 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd (right) Distressing: Ward (right), is comforted by her attorney, Douglas Sheff (left), at their conference in Boston, Massachusetts . Sheff, who called Lloyd's death an unthinkable loss said: 'She wants to ask what happened. Ward said her son, 27, was 'loved my many' 'Very simple: 'What happened?' 'And the next question: 'Why?' Ward said during a press conference on Wednesday: 'The day I learned my son was shot and killed, I thought my life ended with his. 'I always wished I was there to take those bullets for Odin.' She did not address or take questions about the lawsuit but focused her comments on her love for her son. 'Odin was loved by many,' she said. 'Odin will be missed tremendously.' Sheff said it was possible he would call Patriots officials, including owner Bob Kraft, to testify if he thought their testimony would be 'relevant', according to the Boston Herald. He said: 'We will also call different witnesses in the civil case, including Mr Aaron Hernandez. 'When we do he will no longer be able to hide behind any sort of Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination because he is already convicted of the crime. 'No one wants to unnecessarily disturb any professional or anybody, but if it is important and it is part of zealously representing our client, then we will do what we have to.' Wealthy: Hernandez (No. 81) had already been paid more than $9.2million of his $40million deal at the time of the murder . Pain and relief: Ward seen reacting to the guilty verdict for  Hernandez after his trial at Bristol County Superior Court in April . The team was originally named in the suit, but the organization was dismissed after agreeing any money released to Hernandez would be granted to the Lloyd family, Boston.com reported. The Patriots terminated their contract with Hernandez shortly after he was charged and team lawyers have said New England does not owe the 25-year-old 'another penny'. He had already been paid more than $9.2million of his $40million deal and the NFL Players Association filed a grievance on his behalf seeking in additional $6.2million in guaranteed money. They are awaiting the outcome of the grievance said Donald Grady, another of Ward's lawyers. The Patriots and Ward's lawyers have agreed that if it is determined the team owes him more money, it will not pay Hernandez but will instead hold onto the money and alert them and the court. The lawsuit seeking unspecified damages was filed in December 2013 but was put on hold during the criminal trial. While an appeal is automatic in the criminal case, Sheff said he plans to file papers in the next few weeks to resume the lawsuit so he can hunt down Hernandez's assets. One asset they do know about is his home in North Attleborough, which is assessed at $1.2million. Hernandez's fiancee and two-year-old daughter live there. Shaneah Jenkins, a second-year criminal law student and the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, was dating Lloyd . Ward said: 'I always wished I was there to take those bullets for Odin. Odin will be missed tremendously' Former New England Patriots NFL football player Hernandez, 27, seen during his murder trial (file photo) Sheff said that he's not confident Hernandez has any money left after defending himself in the criminal trial but that Hernandez clearly made millions during his career. He said Lloyd's family isn't in it for the money because no amount can compensate for their loss. Lloyd, 27, was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Hernandez picked him up and drove him to an industrial park near his home, where Lloyd was shot six times. Hernandez's lawyer, John Fitzpatrick, did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

"Lord Tebbit has hit out at David Cameron for not being a ‘real man’ with ‘real depth of experience’. The former Tory party chairman said that unlike major figures such as Sir Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee or Aneurin Bevan, Mr Cameron had never had a ‘proper job’. Instead, he said the Prime Minister had done nothing except be a special adviser and working in PR for Carlton Television. Lord Tebbit, pictured, launched an astonishing attack on David Cameron claiming the PM has never had a proper job before entering politics unlike Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee or even Aneurin Bevan . Lord Tebbit, a former airline pilot, also criticised Mr Cameron’s tactics in playing up the threat of a Labour-SNP government, and even suggested Tory voters north of the border vote tactically for Labour. He told the BBC’s Newsnight: ‘I just cannot read Mr Cameron’s mind. It’s a foreign country to me. ‘Men like Churchill, Atlee, Bevan, were real men with real depths of experience. ‘They had not gone from school to university to being a special adviser to working in an advertising agency.’ He added: ‘He doesn’t have that hinterland of experience any more than Mr Miliband.’ Lord Tebbit also suggested that Mr Cameron’s campaign tactics were pushing people into the arms of the SNP and Ukip. Lord Tebbit accused Mr Cameron, pictured, of bungling the Scottish referendum and annoying English voters . ‘Having bungled the Scottish referendum, it seems pointless to just irritate Scots by shouting at them from Westminster,’ the former Cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher said. ‘The English are irritated into voting for Ukip, by being shouted at from Westminster – and the Scots are irritated similarly.’ Lord Tebbit also told The Guardian it was ‘logical’ for Scots to vote tactically for Labour in areas where Conservative candidates stand no chance. ‘From the Tories’ point of view we are not going to come home with a vast number of seats from Scotland,’ he said. ‘We know that. ‘So the choice is would we rather have a Scot Nat or Labour? I think, on balance, probably a Labour MP would be a more reasonable thing to have.’ Meanwhile Madonna was criticised by her gay fanbase yesterday for paying ‘unapologetic’ tribute to Margaret Thatcher – who brought in legislation to ban the ‘promotion’ of homosexuality. The 56-year-old singer posted an image of the Iron Lady on photo-sharing website Instagram along with the caption ‘Thank you Margaret Thatcher’ followed by ‘unapologetic’ and a reference to her latest album, Rebel Heart. But the post was hurriedly removed after her gay fans reminded her that Mrs Thatcher’s ‘anti-gay’ legislation was only overturned in 2003.","Lord Tebbit said figures such as Churchill had careers before politics .

"Denmark has finally passed a law banning bestiality in an attempt to crack down on perverts visiting the country to have sex with animals. The Nordic country decided to tighten up its laws amid reports of animal sex shows, clubs and even animal brothels frequented by tourists taking advantage of its lax regulations. The previous law only stipulated a ban on intercourse which harmed the animals. New law: The Danish government bought in tougher legislation amid fears their relaxed legal stance on bestiality was making the country a destination for people who wanted to have sex with animals . But agricultural minister Dan Jorgensen pointed out it was difficult to prove whether or not the animal had been harmed. 'The current legislation does not protect the animals . enough,' he wrote in an opinion piece. 'It's hard to prove that an animal suffers when a human . has sexual intercourse with it, and that is why we must give the . animal the benefit of the doubt.' Those voting for the bill said Denmark did not want to . remain the last northern European country where bestiality was . legal, as this was attracting animal sex tourists. Germany, . Norway, Sweden and Britain previously banned it. 'There are frequent reports of the occurrence of organised . animal sex shows, clubs and animal brothels in Denmark,' the . Danish Ethical Council for Animals, an independent advisory . board under the food and agriculture ministry, said in a report, . while adding that it had not been able to verify the reports. Tourist destination: There were reports of animal sex shows, clubs and even brothels in the Nordic country . An investigation by the now defunct Danish newspaper 24timer about 10 years ago found animal owners were openly advertising their animals' services 'for sale', for between £57 and £113 - depending on what was required. More recently, a 2011 Justice Ministry report surveyed veterinarians and . found 17 percent of them suspected that an animal they treated . had had intercourse with a human. The advent of the internet no doubt helped the boom in animal sex tourism: there are entire forums dedicated to helping people swap advice on bestiality, as well as pornography. The move leaves few countries in the world where bestiality is still legal: within Europe, it leaves just Finland, Romania and Hungary. In the United States, laws surrounding bestiality vary from state to state: Vermont, New Hampshire and Ohio are some of the states where there is no law against it.","Denmark's previous law only banned bestiality if it harmed the animal .

"Harrowing images have emerged showing the seconds before a media activist was brutally murdered by militants loyal to the Islamic State in Syria. Taken on the frontline of fighting in the countryside outside the rebel-held city of Aleppo, the photos show a prisoner wearing an orange jumpsuit being forced to his knees before being shot. ISIS released the disturbing photographs on the same day as they bizarrely attempted to portray everyday life under the terror group's control as happy and carefree - distributing images of smiling farmers living near Aleppo who use Western technology to grow and harvest their abundant crops. Harrowing: Taken on the frontline of fighting in the countryside outside the rebel-held city of Aleppo, the photos show a prisoner wearing an orange jumpsuit being forced to his knees before being shot . The  new ISIS photographs show the activists just moments before he was shot at point blank range . Images of the media activist's brutal execution were released by ISIS' Halab Media Centre, which operates in and around the city of Aleppo and has previously released sickening images and videos of the terror organisation murdering anybody who dares to oppose them. Brave activists operating on the ground in Syria have been hugely successful in helping to unite and inspire a resistance against the terror group by sharing images and reports of their atrocities online. Groups such as Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, which operates in ISIS' de facto capital city, work undercover, secretly filming ISIS militants as they take part in near daily massacres. This has, however, made the activists a major target, with the terror group exacting bloody revenge on those found to be spreading information on their activities. Charged as spies, the campaigners face certain death - either by being shot at point-blank range or crucified in a public square. The activist seen in the latest ISIS photographs show him just moments before his 'execution'. The fact he was forced to his knees and the presence of men standing around him wielding assault rifles has led analysts to believe his death was almost certainly by shooting, even though his moment of death is not shown and there are no images of his body. Moments from death: With his arms tightly bound behind his back with plastic handcuffs, blurry images show the victim being dragged through a public square by his heavily armed captors . Strange: ISIS released the disturbing execution photographs on the same day as they bizarrely attempted to portray everyday life under the terror group's control as happy and carefree - distributing images of smiling farmers living near Aleppo who use Western technology to grow and harvest their abundant crops . ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorist group, according to an Iraqi source. The source said that he was wounded by an attack from the US-led coalition while travelling in a three-car convoy in March in Nineveh, Iraq. At first his chances of survival were deemed by his lieutenants to be low, but he pulled through. However, he was left so weakened that his inner circle reportedly mooted the idea of naming a new leader. He is slowly recovering but does not have the reins of the organisation, according to The Guardian . Two officials confirmed to the paper that the strike on the convoy did indeed take place, on March 18 in the al-Baaj district of Nineveh, not far from the Syrian border. One, a Western diplomat, told the paper that Coalition generals weren’t sure whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy. With his arms tightly bound behind his back with plastic handcuffs, blurry images show the victim being dragged through a public square by his heavily armed captors. His name and the group he worked for are not known, but ISIS identified the man as a 'media activist' understood to have been murdered sometime earlier this week. The images emerged on the same day as ISIS made a bizarre attempt to portray themselves as a peace-loving group by distributing photos of smiling farmers harvesting their crops. Using Western-style crop-spraying equipment, a group of young men are seen in the fields happily picking cabbages while young boys load them on to the back of a lorry. The happy pastoral scene is in stark contrast to the campaign of rape and massacre ISIS has brought to vast stretches of the Syria and Iraq - where depraved extremists carry out daily atrocities in the name of the radical interpretation if Islam. The juxtaposing scenes emerged as Kurdish officials claimed ISIS militants were preparing for an attack on a city in north east Syria, near the border with Iraq, where the terror group remains a significant threat despite recent setbacks elsewhere in the two countries. Hasaka province in north east Syria is strategically important for all sides and borders ISIS-held territory in Iraq, where the group is back on the offensive after losing Tikrit earlier this month. Modern: Using Western-style crop-spraying equipment, a group of young men are seen in the fields happily picking cabbages while young boys load them on to the back of a lorry . At work: One the cabbages have been picked, young boys are seen loading them on to the back of a lorry . The Syrian Kurdish YPG militia has recorded significant victories against ISIS this year, driving it from the town of Kobane at the Turkish border and then taking two towns in Hasaka province with the help of a U.S.-led air campaign. But ISIS remains a danger, said Redur Xelil, YPG spokesman. Its targets include the provincial capital, Hasaka city, and the town of Tel Tamr, to the northwest. ISIS is still believed to be holding some 200 Assyrian Christians abducted in February from villages near Tel Tamr. 'South of Hasaka there are areas that Daesh controls entirely. There is a big Daesh mobilisation outside the city, and there are big fears of an attack on Hasaka city,' Xelil said in an interview from the city of Qamishli via Skype. Daesh is an Arabic name for ISIS, which calls itself Islamic State. For now, ISIS' priority is Tel Tamr, where it aims to cut a YPG supply route, he added. ISIS is 'trying to take big cities, to take the battle into cities' to mark it harder for the U.S.-led alliance to hit it, he said. The happy pastoral scene is in stark contrast to the campaign of rape and massacre ISIS has brought to vast stretches of the Syria and Iraq - where depraved extremists carry out atrocities in the name of  radical Islam . Claim: The news comes as ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) was reported to have been seriously injured in an airstrike. The militant is no longer in control of the terrorist group, according to an Iraqi source . Hasaka is home to many Syrians who have fled areas further west, including the country's second city Aleppo, Xelil said. The Syrian Observatory, which monitors the Syrian civil war, reports daily clashes between the YPG and ISIS fighters near Tel Tamr, and clashes between the Syrian military and ISIS in areas west and east of Hasaka city. The YPG has emerged as the only partner for the U.S.-led alliance bombing ISIS in Syria. But its effectiveness is greatly diminished beyond areas where the Kurds have set up autonomous zones since Syria's conflict erupted in 2011. The United States, rejecting any partnership with President Bashar al-Assad against ISIS, is about to launch a programme to train and equip members of the mainstream Syrian opposition in order to fight the jihadists elsewhere. Xelil said the YPG had not been consulted on the programme, adding that its requests for military supplies remained unmet.","Campaigner was photographed moments before his murder in rural Aleppo .

"Nigel Farage suffered a fresh blow today after  a new poll showed Ukip trailing badly in a series of key seats. Across 10 constituencies targeted by Mr Farage's party, Ukip has fallen 18 points behind the Tories and seven behind Labour. The revelation came as Mr Farage admitted that he had 'made some mistakes' during the campaign but insisted he was confident he could get it back on track. Scroll down for video . Across the 11 marginal constituencies – including Boston & Skegness, Great Yarmouth and North Thanet – Ukip now trail the Tories by 18 per cent and Labour by 7 per cent . Tonight's survey for ITV News by ComRes is the latest in a string of polls showing Ukip's support being squeezed by Labour the Tories. However, speaking to Channel 4 News tonight, Mr Farage insisted he was looking forward to the rest of the campaign and had 'a bit of the old vim and vigour back'. He said: 'I started the campaign and think I make some mistakes. My desperation for Ukip to do well meant that I really packed the diary and the day in a way that frankly wasn't very bright. I have now trimmed it back a bit. I'm being a bit more selective.' Asked if he was 'exhausted' he said: 'No, I'm now actually rejuvenated and enjoying it again.' But told he had looked 'a bit wonky' earlier in the campaign, Mr Farage said: 'I was. No, no. Hands up I was. I had completely overdone it. 'I wasn't getting it right. I feel a bit of the old vim and vigour back and I'm looking forward to the next fortnight.' The Ukip leader - appearing on ITV's Lorraine this morning - said he had 'made some mistakes' by trying to do too much and had had to scale back his commitments . Mr Farage insisted he was looking forward to the rest of the campaign and had 'a bit of the old vim and vigour back' The admission came as the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg accused Mr Farage of being an 'odious Victor Meldrew' character. In an interview with MailOnline, Mr Clegg said Mr Farage's 'mask is slipping' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white 'lashing out' in a scrabble for headlines. The Lib Dem leader condemned David Cameron's appeal to UKIP supporters to 'come home', warning the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' which is losing all grip on the party. In an interview with MailOnline, Mr Clegg said Mr Farage's 'mask is slipping' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white 'lashing out' in a scrabble for headlines. Nick Clegg told MailOnline that Mr Farage was 'odious' The Lib Dem leader condemned David Cameron's appeal to UKIP supporters to 'come home', warning the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' which is losing all grip on the party. It came after Mr Farage called for any migrants rescued from the Mediterranean to be sent back to Africa. The Ukip leader said 'millions' of refugees could arrive on boats in Europe over the next few years unless they are intercepted and turned back now. Mr Farage urged Prime Minister David Cameron to resist pressure at an emergency summit of EU leaders in Brussels tomorrow for Britain to take in large numbers of refugees brought across the Mediterranean by people-smugglers. He insisted the UK could not take more than 'a few thousand' genuine refugees. His comments came as experts warned that up to 30,000 migrants, including 2,500 children, could be killed this year unless the crisis is tackled. Up to 950 people are believed to have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Libya on Saturday, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Just 28 people are known to have survived the tragedy, described by UNHCR as 'the deadliest incident in the Mediterranean we have ever recorded'. However, a major survey published today suggested Mr Farage's hard-line immigration stance was popular with the public. Barely one in ten electors say they are satisfied with Conservative border policies over the past five years. The poll by Ipsos MORI suggests this unhappiness may be the key factor behind large numbers of Conservative voters switching to Ukip. David Cameron and Boris Johnson campaigned together in London with polls showing that the Tories are on course to hold on to a string of key marginals . Of those who supported David Cameron in 2010, but now intend to vote for Mr Farage's party, 94 per cent are dissatisfied with immigration policy. This compared to 45 per cent of voters sticking with the Tories. This loss of voters to Ukip could be crucial in deciding the outcome of the General Election on May 7 – with the Prime Minister now facing a race against time to win them back. For all voters, six in ten electors say they are unhappy about the Tories handling of the nation's borders. A significant number of voters also insist immigration is still not being discussed enough by the politicians. During the current campaign, the Tories, Labour and Liberal Democrats have all avoided talking about the subject. The poll will now put pressure on the Prime Minister to change course and begin promoting his policies – which are far tougher than any advocated by Labour. The public considers Labour and the Tories to be just as bad as one another when it comes to getting a grip. Alarmingly for Mr Cameron, only 27 per cent think the current government's handling of immigration has been better than under the previous Labour government – and 26 per cent say they're handling it worse. The rest say both are the same. This is despite the fact Labour presided over a policy of open borders in which record numbers were allowed to pour into the UK.","ComRes survey for ITV shows Ukip falling behind in key constituencies .

"Arrested: Rebecca Grant tried to head-butt a deputy, scratched the police car's with her teeth, bit the upholstery and' threatened to kill the deputies' A Maine woman who was being hauled off to jail is facing even more charges after allegedly tearing apart a police cruiser with her teeth and attempting to head-butt a sheriff's deputy. Police in Limington, Maine, had been responding to reports that an apparently drunk woman was walking in and out of traffic and laying in the road on Saturday afternoon. Rebecca Grant, 40, initially claimed that she had been kidnapped and abused, but when she refused to give the name of her captors, police checked her ID and found that she was out on bail. Once York County sheriff’s deputies learned she had bail conditions not to possess or consume alcohol they went to arrest her, Sheriff William King said. However, at this point, she became violent, and attempted to head-butt a deputy sheriff before 'thrusting her head onto the trunk of his cruiser on two occasions,' Bangor Daily News reports. Once Grant, from Biddeford, had been subdued and placed in the police car, officers found white residue on her teeth. They then discovered a three-inch scratch mark in the paint of the trunk, concluding that she had, in fact, 'bitten' the patrol cruiser. Enroute to York County Jail, Grant bit the upholstery, tearing the material, causing $500 worth of damage. She also attempted to kick out the car window, Sheriff King said. In addition, the 40-year-old allegedly threatened to kill deputies and their families. Grant was charged with violating her bail conditions and criminal mischief for causing $500 in damage to the cruiser. She remained jailed Tuesday on a $200 cash bail at the York County Jail in Alfred.

"Chinese scientists have admitted to changing the genes of human embryos for the first time. The announcement confirms rumors that some researchers have been conducting ethically questionable genetic experiments. Some scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea, for fear it could be misused to allow parents to 'select' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren. Chinese scientists have admitted to changing the genes of human embryos, like the one above, for the first time in history. The announcement confirms rumors that some researchers have been conducting ethically questionable experiments . The team tried to tweak the gene responsible for β-thalassaemia, a potentially deadly blood disorder, using a germ line editing technique known as CRISPR/Cas9. CRISPR technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code. Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the CRISPR system targets the genome's source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level. The DNA cut – known as a double strand break – closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally, for instance after chronic sun exposure. But unlike UV rays that can result in genetic alterations, the CRISPR system causes a mutation at a precise location in the genome. When cellular machinery repairs the DNA break, it removes a small snip of DNA. In this way, researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome. The team studied the ability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to edit the gene called HBB responsible for β-thalassaemia . However, others argue that the technology could also be used to rid families of devastating inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or certain cancers. Researchers at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzho have today published their research in the journal Protein & Cell, according to a report in Nature. In the paper, researchers led by Junjiu Huang, attempted to downplay concerns by using 'non-viable' embryos, which can't develop into babies. The team tried to tweak the gene responsible for β-thalassaemia, a potentially deadly blood disorder, using a germ line editing technique known as CRISPR/Cas9. But the researchers involved said that their results revealed 'serious obstacles' in using the technique on human embryos. CRISPR technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code. Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the CRISPR system targets the genome's source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level.

When cellular machinery repairs the DNA break, it removes a small snip of DNA. In this way, researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome. Huang's group studied the ability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to edit the gene called HBB. The team injected 86 embryos and then waited two days for the CRISPR technique to work. Nature reports that of the 71 embryos that survived, 54 were genetically tested. The tests found that 28 were successfully spliced, but only a few contained the replacement genetic material. 'If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100 per cent,' Huang told Nature. 'That's why we stopped. We still think it's too immature.' Germ line genetic editing alters the DNA in sperm and egg cells - meaning the changes can be passed on . Until now scientists have concentrated on using genome editing techniques on somatic cells - non-reproductive cells like those found in skin, muscle, nerves, bone and liver for example - to help them study diseases. Modifying the DNA of human embryos so that DNA changes are preserved in the germ line - the sperm and eggs - means such alterations can be passed on to future generations. Improvements in genetics are causing designer babies to near '100 per cent efficiency' in trials using mice, a leading scientist has warned. Dr Tony Perry, a geneticist at the University of Bath, said that society needed to be prepared for the day parents can choose certain traits in their children. The warning follows a breakthrough last April in which scientists were able to cure a genetic liver disease in living, adult mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique. The CRISPR technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code and could be used to create designer babies. 'We used a pair of molecular scissors and a molecular sat nav that tells the scissors where to cut,' Dr Perry told James Gallagher at the BBC. 'It's a case of 'you shoot you score'...On the human side, one has to be very cautious.' Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the CRISPR system targets the genome's source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level. Such work is already illegal in many countries around the world including the UK, but is permitted in the US and China. A number of other groups around the world are thought to be working on techniques to genetically modify human embryos. Xingxu Huang, from Shanghai Tech University in China has been seeking permission to perform the technique on discarded human embryos after having successfully using it to modify monkey embryos that developed into live animals. Professor George Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School is also said to be developing techniques that could be used to modify human embryos. Dr Luhan Yang, a scientist with Church's group, recently outlined proposals to edit the human germline in an interview with Technology Review. She proposed using immature egg cells from the ovaries taken from women undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer. The immature egg would be grown and coaxed into dividing before a gene-editing technique known as CRISPR would be used to correct the genetic fault that was causing the ovarian cancer. However, the project is not thought to be underway yet and it is not known if it has been approved. Dr Yang, however, has been reported to have been involved in a similar project in China. British and US scientists have already expressed concerns over the ethics of the latest experiment, with one doctor calling for the research to be banned. Dr David King, from watchdog Human Genetics Alert, said: ‘This news emphasises the need for an immediate global ban on the creation of genetically modified designer babies. ‘It is critical that we avoid a eugenic future. If China does not want to get the reputation of being the wild west of the new eugenics it must join the many countries – including the UK –which would ban such research.' Dr George Daley, a stem cell biologist at Harvard Medical School, said the experiment poses a ‘cautionary tale’. He said: ‘Their study should be a stern warning to any practitioner who thinks the technology is ready for testing.’ Professor Shirley Hodgson, an expert in cancer genetics at St George’s, University of London, said: ‘This is a significant departure from currently accepted research practice. Can we be certain that the embryos were indeed non-viable? ‘The fact that there were a number of “off-target” mutations is clearly a worry.’ Many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea, for fear it could be misused to allow parents to 'select' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren . While genetic modification of human embryos is illegal in the UK, the historic decision was taken in February to allow ‘three-parent babies’. This legalised the donor replacement of mitochondrial DNA – the so-called batteries which power the body’s cells. Although the procedure has its critics, it would not alter the genetic characteristics of a child, unlike the Chinese experiment. Alastair Kent, from Genetic Alliance UK which supports families with genetic conditions, said patients would be interested to hear about the Chinese experiment – but undoubtedly would be aware that ‘ethical challenges will need to be resolved’. A DNA technique which allows scientists to tell the difference between identical twins has been discovered. With DNA profiling, police can identify a suspect with a strand of hair or a drop of blood – but it falls apart with twins, who share 100 per cent of their genes. But researchers at the University of Huddersfield claim they can now distinguish between the two. As twins grow their different life experiences create a variation in the hydrogen bonds within their DNA. This could be caused by such things as smoking, sunshine, exposure to chemicals or diet. Dr Graham Williams, who leads the Forensic Genetics Research Group at Huddersfield, has created a method of heating DNA until the hydrogen bonds break – identifying minute differences between twins. He said: ‘We have demonstrated substantial progress towards a test for differentiating between identical twins in forensic case work.’ Last month a leading group of biologists called for a worldwide moratorium on germ line research amid rumours that it had already been used to alter human embryos in China. Edward Lanphier, chairman of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine in Washington DC, and four colleagues, wrote in the journal Nature that such research could harm other areas of science by provoking a public outcry. They wrote: 'It is thought that studies involving the use of genome-editing tools to modify the DNA of human embryos will be published shortly. 'In our view, genome editing in human embryos using current technologies could have unpredictable effects on future generations. 'This makes it dangerous and ethically unacceptable. 'Such research could be exploited for non-therapeutic modifications. 'We are concerned that a public outcry about such an ethical breach could hinder a promising area of therapeutic development, namely making genetic changes that cannot be inherited. 'At this early stage, scientists should agree not to modify the DNA of human reproductive cells.' Their fears tap into concerns that such technology could be used to create 'designer families' where certain traits are selected for. In reality such selection can be difficult as often there is no single gene that provides a single trait and many genes have multiple functions.","Chinese scientists tried to tweak gene responsible for a blood disorder .

They are not allowed to travel without a man accompanying them - and any infringements can result in severe punishment by the religious police. She said: 'Sometimes people get whipped. After that many people began to fear IS.' She explained that it is this fear that is making people join the group. The refugee said fear of IS is making many join them: 'Better to take the things they offer than die of hunger' 'If you are a member of IS they give you gas, petrol and bread,' she said. 'Unfortunately there are a lot of simple-minded people who say ""yes, I'll join them"". Better to take the things they offer than die of hunger, this is how they force people to support them.' In just one example of how the group violently control both men and women, she revealed the terrible punishment inflicted on those who break the rule of not smoking. 'If a man is caught smoking they will heat up a metal skewer and put it in his mouth,' she said. Of everything she has been through, the female refugee said: 'the worst feeling is to witness other people killed in front of you.' The IS tactics have been decribed as taking a 'Ghengis Khan and the mongol approach to military conquest' Sadly, this is common if people fail to stick to the rules defined by IS, who want to establish a Islamic utopia by any means necessary. Alastair Crooke, director Conflicts Forum, explains on the BBC documentary how the terrorist group are taking the 'Ghengis Khan and the mongol approach to military conquest'. He said: 'You create an absolute fear in your enemies and the first time you come to a village you kill everything... the dogs, the cats, destroy it down to the ground.'

"Hundreds have attended the funeral of a nine-year-old Calais schoolgirl who was raped and murdered by a Polish migrant. The tragic killing of Chloe sparked a national outpouring of grief in France after her body was discovered in a migrant camp last week. Mourners  gathered at St Peter's in northern France today where huge screens had been erected to show the ceremony for the many who could not fit inside the packed church. Scroll down for video . Isabelle Hyart  lovingly touched the small white coffin of her daughter Chloe as it was taken down to the waiting hearse . Distraught: Isabelle Hyart breaks down in tears as she leaves the funeral of her daughter Chloe . The procession of grieving family and friends follows the coffin of the nine-year-old outside St Peter's Church . Pall bearers carry the coffin of Chloe, who was raped and murdered on April 15, down the steps of the Saint-Pierre Church in Calais, northern France . The murder of Chloe, who was killed by Zbigniew Huminsk, sparked a national outpouring of grief in France . Chloe had been snatched from a French playground in front of her mother Isabelle Hyart's eyes by Zbigniew Huminsk, 38. The young girl was taken from outside her home after she playfully squirted him with a water pistol. Terror-stricken Miss Hyart had tried helplessly to reach her daughter but Huminsk bundled the girl into his car and drove her to woodland where he sexually assaulted and strangled her. He has since confessed to his crimes. Miss Hyart wept as her daughter was carried out after the ceremony and lovingly touched the small white coffin as it was taken down to the waiting hearse. The distraught mother was comforted by family and friends, including Chloe's father, who all said their final farewells to the young girl. Outside in the Spring sunshine, mourners of all generations stood in silence in tribute to the nine-year-old who was murdered and raped by Huminsk on April 15. This is the last picture of Chloe, taken on the same day she was abducted while she is seated in front of her family home . Schoolgirl killer Zbigniew Huminski (left) did not offer a word of remorse as he was indicted for the kidnap, rape and murder of Chloe (right) News of his appalling crime shocked the country and on Saturday more than 6,000 took to the streets of Calais on Saturday to form a quarter of a mile long 'White March' to pay tribute to Chloe. Many of those marching for Chloe were her friends at the Balzac Dance Club where last January she had performed in a show with them to raise money for the Red Cross, which helps migrants. Huminski has a long criminal record in France and Poland, including once attacking a frail woman of 78 with a knife in her home. The career criminal was sentenced to a year behind bars in March, but under the rules in Poland, he was supposed to take himself to jail. Instead, he hit the road for France and, under the EU's free movement rules, there was nothing to stop him driving across Europe. Despite being banned from France for his earlier offences, Huminski was on his way to see his sister in Southampton last Wednesday when he 'stopped for a beer' in Calais. He then carried out the attack on Chloe while drunk. Hundreds attended the funeral of the Calais schoolgirl who was killed in a brutal crime that shocked the country . Inside the packed St Peter's church, broadcast on the screens outside, mourners stood as they listened to the ceremony . Mourners who  could not fit inside the packed St Peter's Church in Calais for the ceremony gathered outside . Huge screens had been erected outside the church for family, friends and members of the public to pay tribute to the girl . Friends, family and Calais locals gathered outside the church to say their final farewells to the young victim . Miss Hyart said previously: 'I'm appalled, disgusted. I don't understand why he was in France. And why did he come to Calais? I don't understand how anyone could do that to a child of nine.' In court the killer did not offer a word of remorse as he was formally charged with a kidnapping, raping and murdering the girl which are likely to see him jailed for life. Huminski reportedly confessed to murder soon after being arrested close to Chloe's body in remote woodland on the edge of Calais. Deputy mayor Philippe Mignonet had discovered the body after joining the police hunt to find the missing girl. Speaking in the town hall, he said: 'I saw a red car in the bushes and realised it was the car the police were looking for, so I called the police and three officers turned up. 'I will never forget, for as long as I live, the terrible image that day. I cannot get it out of my mind. We all feel so sad for the family. It has been a terrible week for our town.' Describing every parent's worst nightmare, Miss Hyart said the brazen abduction happened in broad daylight on Wednesday when she left her daughter in the playground to pop back inside the flat to change her four-year-old son's clothing. Miss Hyart wept as she left the funeral ceremony of her daughter surrounded by friends and family . The young girl was snatched from outside her home after she playfully squirted him with a water pistol in front of her terror-stricken mother who is pictured leaving the church with Chloe's father . Miss Hyart is comforted by the father of her deceased daughter at the funeral which was attended by hundreds . Miss Hyart said she was later told by police that Chloe had been raped and then strangled to death in an isolated wood once used as an illegal camp for migrants bound for the UK . Chloe had finished school and had been playing outside before her dance lesson at 4pm. At 2.31pm, her mother proudly posted the photo on Facebook of her daughter in her dance clothes – and 59 minutes later she was abducted by Huminski, who neighbours had seen hanging around the housing estate drinking beer. Chloe is said to have pointed a water pistol at Huminski as part of a childish game before he bundled into the car, leaving one of her little white shoes lying on the ground. 'I went upstairs for five minutes to change her little brother,' said Miss Hyart, an unemployed single mother. 'As it was a nice day, she wanted to play with her friend in the playground.' She said she left another adult, the stepfather of one of Chloe's friends, to watch over the children. 'When I came down with my two other kids, he said straight away: 'Someone's taken Chloe'. He said he didn't know who, that he didn't know him. 'I then went round the building shouting Chloe's name. She was still there – I saw her, lying on the ground, hidden behind the dustbins. 'And then this guy, who I didn't see apart from his back, grabbed her, dragged her by the arms into the car with him and left straight away. Hundreds, of all generations, stood in silence outside the church in the Sprind sunshine to pay tribute . A woman sheds tears for Chloe as the mother, relatives and members of the general public attended the funeral mass today . People attend the funeral ceremony for Chloe, whose killer Huminski did not offer a word of remorse as he was formally charged with a kidnapping, raping and murdering the girl which are likely to see him jailed for life . Flowers and tributes are left to the nine-year-old who was killed by the career criminal who had been sentenced to a year behind bars in March, but instead went on the run through France . Touching messages and tributes left to Chloe by family and friends in her hearse at the funeral . 'It was too fast, I was a few meters away with my other children but could not do anything. I was paralyzed. 'I screamed 'Chloe's been taken, Chloe's been taken'. I was in panic. Everybody arrived, including the police, but it was too late. I don't know why nobody intervened to start off with. The guy wasn't that tough.' Miss Hyart said she was later told by police that Chloe had been raped and then strangled to death in an isolated wood once used as an illegal camp for migrants bound for the UK. Police found Huminski's red Seat Toledo with Polish number plates nearby. Huminski, who was drunk, first tried to run away but was then arrested. Huminski, who is single, originally moved to France in the early 2000s, and worked as an odd-job man before attempting to join the Foreign Legion as a soldier. He was rejected because of his long criminal record in France and Poland. Last night Chloe's mother said: 'What did he do to my daughter? I want to know. I want to see him, I want some answers. Walking together: The Mayor of Calais Natacha Bouchart (right) and the mother (centre) of Chloe left Calais City Hill with relatives after a walk in memory of her daughter . The little girl's naked body was found in the woods near Calais 90 minutes after she was taken on April 15 . 'At the moment I'm still in shock, it's like I'm on autopilot. But when I speak about Chloe, I'm in floods of tears. I can't help crying. 'I'm starting to understand that I will not see Chloe again. It's hard. Very hard. 'Above all, I don't know when or how I'm going to tell her little sister and her little brother. They're only five and four, and I don't know how they're going to understand. 'I'm going to tell them that she's gone to heaven, that she'll be with my father, who I lost last year.' Officers were called at 3.30pm and by around 5pm, Chloe's lifeless body had been discovered three miles away in the Dubrulle Wood. Until a few weeks ago, it was the site of a large immigrant camp, made up of mainly men trying to get aboard ferries sailing to the south coast of England. Such camps are regularly razed by the French authorities, with the migrants moved on. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls called for a full investigation in to Huminski's past, saying Chloe's family deserved the 'whole truth'. Christine Taubira, the justice minister, also demanded a 'complete, precise and rapid' investigation.'","Mourners gathered outside St Peter's to pay tribute to nine-year-old Chloe .

"A councillor who stabbed his wife nine times with a kitchen knife after discovering her affair with the postman has been jailed for 20 years. Joseph O'Riordan, 76, was found guilty of attempted murder after his wife Mandy, 47, was left with life-threatening injuries to the chest, torso and back at their home in Polegate, East Sussex. The former Polegate town councillor had become suspicious of his wife's movements and placed a GPS tracker on her car as he hired a private detective to watch her, a court heard. Guilty: Joseph O'Riordan, 74, stabbed his wife Amanda, 47, (pictured together above) nine times with a kitchen knife at the home they shared in Polegate, East Sussex, after discovering her affair with postman Nick Gunn . He soon discovered his estate manager wife was having an affair with married postman, Nick Gunn, nicknamed 'Tommy' by friends and family, who lived and worked in their village. It was revealed yesterday that the 41-year-old postman had had previous affairs with women on his rounds. Brighton Crown Court  heard how O'Riordan repeatedly stabbed his wife in their bedroom of their ground floor flat on October 22 last year, after arguing about the affair. Ambulance crews arrived to find his wife lying on a blood-soaked bed and she was rushed to hospital, where she underwent six hours of emergency surgery to save her life. Nick Gunn: He had affairs with women on his rounds . O'Riordan directed officers to where had left the nine-inch kitchen knife he had used to stab his wife in an 'icily calm manner', the court heard. The former nightclub owner denied attempted murder but a jury took two hours to find him guilty yesterday and he was handed a 20-year prison sentence by Judge Shani Barnes today. He will serve half behind bars and the rest on licence and was also handed a restraining order, banning him for ever contacting his wife directly or indirectly. Sentencing, Judge Barnes, told him: 'You had dedicated your life to serving your community and conducting works for charity. 'But like most of us we are not all good and bad. 'The damage you have done to her is absolutely terrible. 'You have not taken responsibility of what you did to her that night,' the Hastings Observer reports. After the hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Mike Ashcroft, of the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: 'We are pleased to have secured a conviction and salutary sentence in what has been a tragic case. 'It could so easily have been a murder investigation and I would like to pay tribute to the victim, Mrs O'Riordan, for the fortitude she has shown throughout.''In sentencing her husband for the attack in which he stabbed her several times, Judge Barnes said O'Riordan had shown no true remorse for what he had done, and he was a man who had enjoyed the control over Mrs O'Riordan. 'As he felt that control had gone, he took a calculated decision to attempt to kill his wife.' The couple had been married for ten years and had attended the Queen's garden party in 2013 for O'Riordan's work on the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Mrs O'Riordan was a 23-year-old divorcee when she met the older O'Riordan in 1991. They married in 2004 and were seen by many friends as the 'perfect, loving couple'. But as O'Riordan became older his wife essentially became his 'carer' and the court heard how she wanted more 'freedom'. Prosecutor Dale Sullivan said O'Riordan had 'clearly lied' when he told police officers repeatedly that he had stabbed his wife because he had 'just found out she was having an affair'. In reality he had known for weeks that she was seeing Mr Gunn. When Mrs O'Riordan gave evidence last week she did so from behind a screen so she did not have to see O'Riordan. She told the court: 'I loved Joe. I didn't want to hurt him. I never wanted to hurt him – even now.' O'Riordan (left) was convicted of attempted murder after a jury took just two hours and ten minutes to unanimously find him guilty of trying to kill his wife with a nine-inch kitchen knife (right) in October last year . O'Riordan was sitting on Polegate Town Council when he grew suspicious that his wife, Amanda, 47, was having an affair and hired a private investigator to follow her which confirmed her relationship with Mr Gunn . Last year – despite having married three years ago and having moved with his wife Sara Saunders to Portslade, near Brighton – Mr Gunn and Mrs O'Riordan became lovers. But she was not his first, it is claimed. A 39-year-old former partner, who did not want to be named, said: 'We split up because he was having an affair. I saw that he had made a comment on Facebook about a ""lover"" and I knew he wasn't talking about me so I confronted him. 'He admitted he had been sleeping with a woman he had been delivering post to. He told me that something similar had happened with a previous girlfriend as well. We were together for six years, and this might have happened more than once. I didn't find out until July 2011.' After that affair Mr Gunn married schoolteacher Miss Saunders, who said last night: 'I'm still married to him at the moment and I'm not interested in talking about him.' Mr Gunn has a Facebook page and describes himself on Twitter as: 'A Gamer, a Lover, a Postman and a friend of Death.' As the affair developed last year, O'Riordan first hired a detective to watch his wife and then set up a GPS tracker on her car. The £300 tracker reported back via text to O'Riordan's phone whenever his wife left home and gave the exact location of her vehicle. On one day alone on October 9 the tracker sent a total of 35 notifications to O'Riordan as his wife visited Mr Gunn at his then home in Portslade. O'Riordan used to run nightclubs in the South East before he retired and was also a councillor in East Sussex and became president of his local Royal British Legion. Friends and family of Mrs O'Riordan arrived at Brighton Magistrates' Court (left) for the verdict today while O'Riordan's son Liam - from a previous marriage - also attended the hearing to see his father convicted .

"Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his £2million home to his children at the height of the police paedophile case against him. It puts the luxury apartment out of reach for potential child abuse victims suing the peer for compensation. His flat, in a gated community near Hampstead Heath, north London, was transferred free of charge to his two daughters and son in March last year – the same month that police raided his Westminster office, and three months after they had swooped on his home. Scroll down for video . Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his £2 million flat in this complex to his children after the police raid . Lord Janner, pictured, was able to sign over the flat despite his legal team claiming he was unfit to stand trial . The revelation follows an outcry over the decision not to prosecute the former Labour MP for child abuse. Victims and leading politicians accused Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders of ‘damaging public confidence’ in the justice system with her ruling that Lord Janner’s dementia made him unfit to stand trial – despite a tide of evidence against the 86-year-old. But his mental health did not seem to stand in the way of him signing legal documents to transfer ownership of the flat. Last night, Liz Dux, a solicitor from Slater and Gordon representing several of the peer’s alleged victims, said: ‘They will be asking how a man who lacks the mental capacity to stand trial has sufficient capacity to give valid instructions to transfer his assets. ‘It will be of great concern to them to see what may be their last opportunity to achieve any sort of justice deliberately obstructed. ‘The court would be asked to look at any transactions undertaken in recent months which could constitute efforts to defraud potential creditors.’ Peter Garsden, a solicitor representing two other alleged victims, said: ‘Obviously it puts obstacles in the way … There must be suspicions about the intention of the transfer. It would be looked on very critically by a court of law.’ Lord Janner’s duplex apartment over ground and basement floors, with private off-street parking, is likely to have been the peer’s most valuable asset. A neighbouring flat was recently on sale for £1.99million and another fetched £1.8million last year. In 2013, paedophile BBC presenter Stuart Hall signed over the deeds of his £2million house to his wife just before he was jailed – then offered those he had abused as little as £2,000 to prevent them claiming compensation. Civil cases are being prepared to force Lord Janner to pay sizeable compensation to his alleged victims. His flat had been owned solely by him since June 1988, Land Registry documents show. Police raided the property in December 2013 as part of Operation Enamel into historic claims he molested a string of youngsters. Ownership was transferred to his children, Daniel Janner, Marion Janner and Laura Janner-Klausner, on March 26 last year. A Land Registry official confirmed the mortgage-free flat had not been sold, quoting from a transfer document that said: ‘The transfer is not for money and not for anything that has a monetary value.’ Any solicitor assisting with the conveyancing process would have had to be sure Lord Janner was of sound mind. Since he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2009, the former Labour MP has claimed more than £100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances. On April 9, he was fit enough to sign a letter saying he wanted to remain in the House of Lords. A week later, the Crown Prosecution Service decided Lord Janner would not be tried over child sex allegations as he was suffering so much from Alzheimer’s disease that he could not understand any charges against him, let alone answer them. This was despite the fact it ruled there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sex offences against children from 1969 to 1988. Victims have accused authorities of helping to cover up the crimes of a once powerful man and destroying any hope they had of justice. Campaigners, MPs, police and victims have vowed to challenge the decision in the courts. Lord Janner is accused of preying on boys at care homes around his former Leicester West constituency. He was first investigated over abuse claims in 1991 but no further action was taken. An alleged victim gave evidence to the police in 2002 but it was never passed to the CPS. After another alleged victim came forward in 2007, the CPS decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. Last night a spokesman for the Janner family said they would not be commenting. In a statement last week, they said the peer is ‘a man of great integrity’ who is ‘entirely innocent of any wrongdoing’.","Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his flat in Hampstead north London .

"Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal has pledged to give 100 Bentleys to Saudi pilots who took part in air strikes against rebels advancing in Yemen . A Saudi prince has promised to give a free Bentley to every pilot involved in the Yemen air strikes, as bombing raids in the country appeared to resume despite a pledge that they would stop. Saudi Arabian forces launched air strikes on Yemen a month ago to stop advances from the Shiite Houthi rebels, who are allied with Iran and previously overthrew the Saudi-backed government. Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, the Saudi King Abdullah's nephew, has reportedly promised to give each of the 100 fighter pilots involved in the month long raids in Riyadh, the Saudi Arabian capital, a free Bentley. Prince Talal, who owns $300 million stake in Twitter, apparently made the pledge on social media but the post has since been deleted, the International Business Times reported. He wrote: 'To recognise the one hundred participating Saudi pilots I am pleased to present them with 100 Bentley cars,' On Tuesday the Saudis said the bombing raids, which have killed at least 944 people and wounded around 3,480, had been successful and they were to focus on finding a political solution instead. But the raids appeared to have resumed by Wednesday, with fighting taking place in Taez. Dozens more people are said to have been wounded or killed. Bin Talal, 60, is the grandson of Saudi Arabia's founder Ibn Saud and one of the richest men ion the world. He has an estimated fortune of $23 billion and investments in London's Savoy Hotel, Apple, Citigroup and News Corp. He has previously gifted 25 Bentleys to members of a Saudi football team and in 2013 threatened to boycott Forbes magazine for underestimating his wealth and saying he was only in 26th place in a list of the world's richest. Almost 1,000 people are thought to have been killed during four weeks of air strikes by Saudi Arabian forces . The Prince, who is a billionaire, has pledged to give each of the pilots involved in the air strikes a Bentley . His comments were met with criticism on Twitter, as well as supporters of those in Yemen who have been killed in the month long airstrikes. Saudi forces began its military campaign, called Operation Decisive Storm, on March 26. They were launched to stop the advancement of Shiite Houthi rebels who had previously overthrown the Saudi-backed government and ousted President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. Saudi Arabian forces pledged that air strikes which destroyed areas of Sanaa would stop on Tuesday, but they appeared to resume again on Wednesday following advances by rebels on the ground in Yemen . After four weeks Hadi had still not be reinstated and the rebels still retain control of the capital Sanai. The Saudis announced yesterday an end to the 'successful' Operation Decisive Storm and that they would be moving to a new operation, dubbed 'Restoring Hope.' This is to focus on security and counter terrorism and was said to involve a downscaling of military activity. However the Saudi-led coalition had warned it stood ready to counter against any advance by the rebels - and appeared to take action today as fighting resumed in the second city of Aden as well as Taez. In Taez, the rebels took advantage of the lull in air strikes to overrun the headquarters of the 35th Armoured Brigade, loyal to Hadi,  an army officer said. The conflict has created severe shortages of food and other supplies by closing sea and airports.","Air strikes were launched by Saudi forces a month ago against rebels .

"Want to know what Australians get up to when the lights go out? One in five admit to doing a spot of online shopping in bed at night, according to a new study. The nocturnal shopping sprees are likely down to the 86 per cent of those surveyed who admit to turning to online retailers to purchase items that they are too embarrassed to buy in stores. The things considered too awkward for first person purchases include underwear, hair removal cream, personal hygiene products,  medication... and action figures. Nocturnal shopping spree: One in five Australians shop online at night in bed, while 86 per cent to going online for items they're too embarrassed to buy in store . And this is the least of stealthy shopper habits. The study, released by the StarTrack Online Retail Industry Awards,  found work will often take a back seat when online shopping is only a click away. More than 27 per cent of Australians confess to shopping online at work and 3 per cent even took a sick day  to be able to sign for online orders when they arrived at home. These cunning capers even extend into the offline world, with 24 per cent of shoppers confessing to trying an item on in-store with the intention of buying it online later. Confessions of a shopaholic: 13 per cent of those surveyed admit to online shopping three to four times per day . Shoppers were also found to great covert lengths to keep online shopping habits a secret from their partner, friends or  boss. With  savvy shopping skills at play, it's no surprise then that Australians admit they are online addicts. Of those surveyed, most admitted to shopping up to twice a day and 13 per cent will click through online stores three to four times a day (equivalent to 4.6 hours a week). So how much are we spending? Three-quarters of Australians will spend up to $300 per month or at least $3,600 per year, according to StarTrack. Read below to find out which type you are... 1.

"The senior Islamic State commander linked to the Anzac Day terror plot has called for new terror attacks on Australian soil in a flash new propaganda video. Authorities named Abu Khaled al-Cambodi - former Melbourne man Neil Prakash - as a key figure in their investigation into a plot where teenagers were allegedly planning to attack police on Saturday. Now al-Cambodi has starred in a 12-minute long propaganda video where, cradling a gun, he has ordered his 'beloved brothers' to 'rise up' and attack targets in Australia. 'You must start attacking before they attack you,' the 23-year-old said. 'Look how much your sisters have been violated. Threatening message: Abu Khaled al-Cambodi, an Australian IS militant, has starred in a vile new propaganda video . Despite the militant's vitriol, the most recent local headlines surrounding anti-Muslim prejudice have focused upon Sydney woman Stacey Eden, 23, standing up for a couple being bullied on the train . 'All I hear about the news in Australia is this sister was hurt, this sister's hijab was ripped off... I ask you brothers, when are you going rise up and attack them'. Despite the militant's vitriol, the most recent local headlines surrounding anti-Muslim prejudice have focused  upon Sydney woman Stacey Eden, 23, standing up for a couple being bullied on the train. al-Cambodi is thought to have become the most senior recruiter of Australian militants for the Islamic State. Terror expert Professor Greg Barton has described him as 'Baryalei Mark II' - a reference to former Sydney militant Mohammad Ali Baryalei. Baryalei, a former spruiker in the city's nightclub district and a bit-part actor in the crime drama Underbelly, was killed last October. The militant was seen with a gun slung over his shoulder and clambering through rubble . Raid scenes: A man walks past a broken window from a police raid in Melbourne designed to foil the purported Anzac Day plot . 'It seems that Prakash has stepped in as the Baryalei Mark II, and that's significant,' Prof Barton, director at Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, told the ABC's 730 program. 'That makes him, like Baryalei before him, the highest ranking Australian within Islamic State we're aware of.' Baryalei was the ringleader of a foiled plot to behead a random member of the public in Sydney. Mohammad Ali Baryalei was a senior Islamic commander - and a bit part actor in Unberbelly (above, his acting shot) - before he was killed . In the propaganda video, al-Cambodi discusses becoming a Muslim not long after hearing a unnamed preacher lecture about 'Judgment Day'. At various points, he is filmed greeting other men in shops and on the streets of the Islamic State. At one point, he even shoots a broad smile at the camera. The video featuring al-Cambodi was advertised at the conclusion of a similar video last July, but it did not appear online until this week.","Senior Australian Islamic State commander stars in new propaganda clip .

"Angelina Jolie has said that the cost of testing for breast cancer genes 'remains an obstacle for many women'. The actress, who underwent a double mastectomy in 2013, was referring to a genetic test that currently costs more than $3,000 (£2,000). Now a Silicon Valley-based start-up is offering an at-home DNA saliva test that detects the same gene mutations but is priced at only $249 (£167). A Silicon Valley-based start-up is offering an at-home DNA saliva test to detect the same gene mutations priced at just $249 (£167). It tests for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 . It tests for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, along with 17 other markers, all of which are linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Women with a mutation in BRCA1 have a lifetime risk of up to 80 percent for developing breast cancer and up to a 50 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer. The company behind the test, Color Genomics, was founded by Elad Gil, a former cancer researcher at MIT and Otman Laraki, a former engineer at Twitter and Google. 'We founded Color because we want to give every person the opportunity to understand their genetic risk of cancer,' said Dr Gil. Angelina Jolie recently said that the cost of testing for breast cancer genes 'remains an obstacle for many women'. The actress, who is pictured here with her husband Brad Pitt, was referring to a genetic test that currently costs more than $3,000 (£2,000) 'This important information gives people the opportunity to work with their physician to manage their risk and make key life choice.' To get hold of the test, a physician will need to order it online, with the patient receiving a kit at home. The kit has instructions on how to take a sample of saliva and send it back to a central lab for processing. 'We want to make sure that there is always a physician involved,' the founders told Quartz. Color Genomics is currently available in 45 states and is hoping to comply with regulations required in New York, Maryland, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Florida. However, the test has received mixed responses with some saying it might not be useful, and could even be harmful. 'I worry it will give women information that we really don't know what it means - and that women will make very difficult choices that turn out to be incorrect,' Frances Visco of the National Breast Cancer Coalition told NPR. 'If we have more women who believe they are at increased risk,' Visco says, 'we will have more women removing healthy body parts. 'We really do not have enough information to base this kind of expansion of this kind of testing.' Color Genomics did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com for comment. Researchers found coffee can stop the growth of tumours in women who have already been treated with the drug tamoxifen . Just two cups of coffee a day could halve the risk of breast cancer returning in women recovering from the disease, a study has found. Researchers found coffee can stop the growth of tumours in women who have already been treated with the drug tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is the main hormonal therapy drug given to women who have not been through the menopause, and is usually taken for five years or longer after treatment for breast cancer. Most breast cancer tumours rely on the hormone oestrogen to grow, and tamoxifen blocks oestrogen from reaching the cancer cells. This means the cancer either grows more slowly or stops growing altogether. As part of the study, Swedish and British researchers looked at data from 1,090 breast cancer patients, in a follow up of a similar study carried out two years ago. They found that more than 500 women who had been treated with tamoxifen, and those that had drunk at least two cups of coffee a day, had only half the risk of their cancer returning than those who drank less coffee, or none at all.","Test is being offered by Silicon Valley-based start up Color Genomics .

"Jurors spent only about an hour deliberating Tuesday before convicting an Oregon woman of killing two handymen and feeding their bodies to her pigs. The Jackson County jury found Susan Monica guilty of murdering two men about a year apart, then abusing their corpses by feeding them to the animals at her farm, The Medford Mail Tribune reported. Circuit Judge Tim Barnack immediately sentenced 66-year-old Monica to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after a minimum of 50 years. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Susan Monica was found guilty on Tuesday of murdering two handymen on her pig farm over a one-year span. She was sentenced to a minimum of 50 years in prison. Pictured above in court on Tuesday . Floored: Monica and her defense team react to hearing a guilty verdict in court on Tuesday . 'You shot two people and fed them to your pigs,' the judge told Monica. 'I don't know how else I can put it. You valued pigs more than you value people. 'It may sound harsh, but you are a cold-blooded killer,' Barnack said. Prosecutors said Stephen Delicino, 59, was killed in 2012 and Robert Haney, 56, died in 2013. Monica asked for sentencing as soon as the jury was dismissed, saying 'it doesn't seem to matter.' The case will be appealed, the defense said. Victim: Robert Haney (pictured) is one of the two men Monica was found guilty of killing. She admitted to shooting Haney when she found him being attacked by her pigs in 2013, but jurors didn't buy the story . Monica's changing stories about how she shot Delicino and Haney never matched the forensic evidence, Allan Smith, senior assistant deputy district attorney, told jurors in closing arguments. She variously claimed that Delicino shot himself repeatedly in the head and also that she shot him in self-defense and he was eaten by her pigs before she buried his remains on her 20-acre farm in southern Oregon, Smith reminded jurors. Monica told investigators Haney disappeared in the summer of 2013. She said she came on him a month later as pigs were disemboweling him, and she shot him to ease his suffering. She later questioned whether he was alive when she shot him. Defense attorney Garren Pedemonte argued there was no concrete evidence to rebut Monica's claims that she shot Delicino in self-defense or to show that Haney was actually alive when Monica shot him. Some of his remains were found in plastic bags in her barn. A State Police forensic anthropologist, Veronica Vance, testified that Haney's legs had been chopped off with an ax, and the thigh bones showed signs of being gnawed by an animal. Vance said she couldn't determine whether the ax blows came before or after Haney died. She said Delicino suffered three to four gunshot wounds to the head, but there was no evidence one way or another about the self-defense claim. 'Just because Susan Monica is different and strange and weird doesn't make her a murderer,' another defense lawyer, Christine Herbert, told the jury. Gruesome discovery: The remains of the two handymen were found on Monica's farm after investigators noticed she was using one of the men's food stamps . Quick: It took a jury just an hour to come to the decision to convict Monica of murder. Pictured above in court on April 14 . Changing hair: Monica wore a short wig throughout the proceedings. Pictured above in two mugshots, one wearing a long wig and the other bald . At one point during the six-day trial, Monica herself cross-examined sheriff's Detective Eric Henderson, who was the lead investigator in the case, despite having her own defense team. On Monday, a cellmate of Monica's testified the defendant signed a birthday card in jail with this phrase: 'from the sweetest murderer in Jackson County.' 'I got chills from the birthday card,' 23-year-old inmate Jordan 'Janae' Farris testified. Farris was serving time for violating probation from a burglary conviction and met Monica in the Jackson County Jail. Monica said she signed the card in accordance with the charges she was facing, KDRV-TV reported. As the judge addressed the jury before deliberations Tuesday, the newspaper reported that Monica stood up, raised her hand and began asking for the chance to give jurors one more demonstration on how she claimed she shot Delicino. 'I'd like to demonstrate how I shot him for 10 seconds,' Monica said. Barnack initially ignored her. Then Monica put her hands in the air, as she did in her earlier testimony from the stand, and said, 'I held the gun like this.' At that, the judge ordered her back to jail and sheriff's deputies took her away.","It took jurors just an hour to convict Susan Monica on the murder charges on Tuesday .

"A Czech politician says he has created an entirely new country by claiming three-square-mile patch of land along the Croatia-Serbia border that neither country claims is theirs. Vit Jedlicka, 31, a member of the Czech Republic's Conservative Party of Free Citizens, is the self-declared president of 'Liberland', which is located on the banks of the Danube River. The land making up the so-called 'micronation' was apparently forgotten when the Balkan Peninsula which split into new countries following the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Mr Jedlicka says that under international law he is now entitled to take control of the apparently 'unclaimed' territory'. Hope: If Liberland is ever formally recognised it will become the third smallest sovereign state in the world, behind the Vatican City and Monaco . Mr Jedlicka describes himself as a Libertarian and says citizens living in 'Liberland' will be able to set their own individual rate of tax, as well as drawing up their own property and personal rights. Founder: Vít Jedlicka, 31, is a member of the Czech Republic's Conservative Party of Free Citizens . The anti-EU Czech politician says the idea for the state came from a desire to live in a country where 'honest' people could prosper with minimal to no interference from a centralised government. All services - such as medical, fire and refuse - would operate voluntarily, with the overall idea being that the nation's perfectly capable citizens would eventually work out the correct level of taxation and the right service requirements for a fully-functioning nation, without the levels being set by the state. 'We really felt restricted. We really felt under pressure,' Mr Jedlicka told Fox News. 'We really feel that Europe needs another tax haven. We need a place where people can prosper,' he added. During the phone interview Mr Jedlicka said: 'We couldn't make our government lower taxes. I tried hard to tell my politicians that we need to lower taxes. That we need to lower regulation. 'All my opponents told me, ""you should have your own state to prove your ideas of liberty"". So I did it,' he went on to say. After extensive research into areas classified as terra nullius, or 'no man's land', Mr Jedlicka discovered the 2.7 square mile patch of land along the Croatia-Serbia border. Unclaimed territory: Liberland is located on the Croatia-Serbia border, on the banks of the Danube River . The so-called creation of Liberland is far from the first time an individual has declared the formation of a new nation state. The most famous example is Principality of Sealand - an abandoned oil rig off the coast of Suffolk that declared independence in 1967. Although only two people live there and it has never been formally recognised, Sealand has its own football club and national flag. Even if after lengthy legal analysis proves 'Liberland' is a genuinely 'unclaimed territory', the world's new newest nation still fails one of the basic tests for sovereignty. With only one citizen currently living in the country and access to the area strictly limited by Croatia and Serbia, there is no way Liberland is able to protect itself from neighbouring states. Even if Liberland's so-called citizens were able to reach the country, Croatia's border police still operate in the region. This means that even if Liberland does exist, it is a failed state occupied by a foreign nation. He asked the area's only resident whether he agreed to the nation-building plan and, upon being given the go-ahead, declared the formation of Liberland. If the country was ever formally recognised it would be the third smallest sovereign state in the world, behind the Vatican City and Monaco. With the motto 'Live and Let Live', Mr Jedlicka claims he has already received 250,000 applications for citizenship, as well as financial pledges to set up the structure of a state, including establishing telecommunication infrastructure. Not everybody is so keen on the plan, however. Croatia has already reportedly declared that it will not recognise the 'micronation', adding that although it isn't taking the declaration seriously, it still considers the declaration of a nation state 'virtual trespassing'. Czech journalists also tried to visit the territory last week, but were blocked from entering and the 'Liberland' flag that was initially flown over the area has apparently now been taken down. Legal experts have also poured cold water on the idea, claiming that although the territory may appear unclaimed, it is almost certainly already part of Serbia. This is because after Yugoslavia's break-up, any land in the area not claimed by Croatia was automatically absorbed into Serbia.","Vít Jedlicka researched unclaimed land in Europe to launch a 'new' nation .

Tiny 'country' lies on the banks of the Danube and has only one citizen .

"TV celebrity Dr Mehmet Oz will take on his detractors in the medical community head-on during a special episode of his daytime talk show Thursday, sending a strong message that he will not be silenced. Oz, 54, found himself at the center of a firestorm last week when 10 prominent doctors sent a letter to Columbia University, where he serves as vice chairman and professor of surgery at College of Physicians, calling for his resignation because he is a 'charlatan who promotes ‘quack treatments.' In a special episode of The Dr Oz Show, which was pre-taped Tuesday and will air Thursday, the beleaguered physician directly addressed his attackers and accused them of trying to bully him into silence. Scroll down for video . Teaser: TV celebrity Dr Mehmet Oz released a videotaped message previewing a special episode of his show Thursday, which will be dedicated to the controversial swirling around him . Bold statement: Oz, 54, says in the video that he will not let the 10 doctors who launched a campaign last week to try and get him fired from Columbia University silence him . The show released a 25-second teaser clip to CNN Money featuring a part of Oz's rebuttal to promote the upcoming episode. ‘This month, we celebrate my 1000th show,’ Oz says in the preview. ‘I know I've irritated some potential allies in our quest to make America healthy. ‘No matter our disagreements, freedom of speech is the most fundamental right we have as Americans. And these 10 doctors are trying to silence that right. Looking directly into the camera, Oz concluded: ‘So I vow to you right here and right now: we will not be silenced, we will not give in.’ According to a spokesperson for The Dr Oz Show, about two-thirds of this week’s episode will be devoted to the controversy. On Friday, Dr Oz will sit down for an interview on NBC's Today show. The Harvard-educated doctor joined the faculty at Columbia in 1993. He has been hosting his health and wellness talk show since 2009. Ten top doctors sent a letter to Columbia University urging the school to remove TV celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz from his faculty position because he is a 'charlatan' who promotes 'quack treatments' ‘I bring the public information that will help them on their path to be their best selves,’ Oz said in a statement released through a representative of The Dr. Oz Show, according to USA Today. Columbia's Medical and Health Sciences Center . He continued: ‘We provide multiple points of view, including mine, which is offered without conflict of interest. That doesn't sit well with certain agendas which distort the facts.’ Dr Henry Miller, of California's Stanford University led the campaign against Dr Oz and was the first person to sign the letter, the New York Daily News reported. Miller said: 'He's a quack and a fake and a charlatan. 'I think I know the motivation at Columbia. 'They're star-struck, and like having on their faculty the best-known doctor in the country. 'But the fact is that his advice endangers patients, and this doesn't seem to faze them.' He told CBS News that ‘a person who endangers patients and is a menace to public health should not be on the faculty of a prestigious medical institution’. The nine other doctors from across the country included Dr Joel Tepper, a cancer researcher from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, and Dr Gilbert Ross of the American Council on Science and Health in New York City. The doctors sent the letter to Lee Goldman, the dean of Columbia's Faculties of Health Sciences and Medicine. The physicians accused Dr Oz of pushing 'miracle' weight-loss supplements with no scientific proof that they work. The doctors wrote that Oz, for years a world-class Columbia cardiothoracic surgeon, has 'misled and endangered' the public. From left to right, Dr Phil McGraw, financial advisor Suze Orman, host Oprah Winfrey, Dr Mehmet Oz and interior designer Nate Berkus participate in The Oprah Winfrey Show live from Radio City Music Hall in 2010 . For more, visit Extra online. The letter read: 'He has manifested an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain. 'Thus, Dr Oz is guilty of either outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgments about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments, or both. The authors of the scathing communique took a particular issue with what they described as Oz's ‘baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops.’ CNN Money and the New York Times reported that some of the doctors opposing Oz have strong ties to the GMO food industry, namely the advocacy group American Council on Science and Health. Dr Miller, a researcher with a conservative think tank, has been a vocal proponent of genetically modified foods and has spoken out against mandatory labeling. Dr Oz insists that he is not opposed to GMOs on principle but wants them to be properly labelled so that educated consumers would know exactly what is in their food. 'I do not claim that GMO foods are dangerous, but believe that they should be labeled like they are in most countries around the world,' he said in his statement Friday. The New York Ivy League school responded Thursday, issuing a statement to The Associated Press saying only that the school 'is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.' Special interests: The authors of the letter took an issue with what they described as Oz's 'baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops.' The surgeon has been a vocal proponent of mandatory labeling of GMOs, while some of his critics have been advocating for the GMO industry . Dr Oz first came to public attention as a frequent television guest of Oprah Winfrey. For the past five years, he's been the host of The Dr Oz Show. Last year, he appeared before a US Senate panel that accused him of endorsing products that were medically unsound. At the time, the doctor acknowledged some of the products he advised his viewers to use 'don't have the scientific muster to present as fact.' A show representative did not immediately return a call Thursday from the AP seeking comment. As vice chairman of Columbia's surgery department, Dr Oz still occasionally teaches, said Douglas Levy, spokesman for the Columbia University Medical Center. The controversy did not die down after his testimony. The company behind the""miracle"" diet supplement in question later agreed to pay a $3.5 million settlement over false advertising. A study that purported to prove the product's weight-loss benefits turned out to be based on fraudulent data and was retracted.","Dr Mehmet Oz is vice chairman at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons and is a professor of surgery .

"Nigel Farage has admitted that he has a 'preference' for Australian immigrants over Eastern Europeans and Somalians. The Ukip leader said he had to 'confess' that he was happier accepting migrants from Commonwealth countries such as Australian and India because they could speak English and understood Britain's legal system. The controversial remarks come after Mr Farage demanded that refugees fleeing to Europe across the Mediterranean are sent back. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage, speaking to BBC Newsnight,  admitted that he has a 'preference' for Australian immigrants over Eastern Europeans and Somalians . Mr Farage, who has also admitted today that he went 'a bit wonky' and made mistakes at the start of Ukip's election campaign, was asked on BBC Newsnight whether he was anti all immigration or preferred some foreigners to others. The BBC presenter Evan Davis asked: 'Let's suppose one from Mogadishu with the same skills, the same ability to speak English, but not as a first language from one from Melbourne do you have a preference?' Mr Farage said: 'I have to confess I do have a slight preference. I do think, naturally that people from India and Australia are in some ways more likely to speak English, understand common law and have a connection with this country that some people that come perhaps from countries that haven't fully recovered from being behind the Iron Curtain.' The remarks are the latest in a series of pointed interventions Mr Farage has made on the issue of immigration. During the live leaders' TV debates Mr Farage said the NHS should not be treating foreigners with HIV. Speaking to the BBC tonight, Mr Farage admitted that he purposely ramped up the rhetoric to 'wake people up'. He said: 'Sometimes have to say things in a way to get noticed, of that there's no question. 'In order to get the public aware of some of these issues perhaps at time that tone had to be used. But you are not you are not hearing, and you're interviewing me now as we approach a general election, you are not hearing that tone from me.' The Ukip leader's remarks are the latest in a series of pointed interventions Mr Farage has made on the issue of immigration . Ukip has fallen behind the Tories and Labour in a poll of 10 target constituencies, according to a ComRes poll for ITV News . Earlier Mr Farage admitted that he had 'made some mistakes' in the campaign insisted he was looking forward to the rest of the campaign and had 'a bit of the old vim and vigour back'. Speaking to Channel 4 News tonight he said: 'I started the campaign and think I make some mistakes. 'My desperation for Ukip to do well meant that I really packed the diary and the day in a way that frankly wasn't very bright. I have now trimmed it back a bit. I'm being a bit more selective.' Asked if he was 'exhausted' he said: 'No, I'm now actually rejuvenated and enjoying it again.' Nigel Farage told ITV's Lorraine that migrants from Africa should be sent back . But told he had looked 'a bit wonky' earlier in the campaign, Mr Farage said: 'I was. No, no. Hands up I was. I had completely overdone it. 'I wasn't getting it right. I feel a bit of the old vim and vigour back and I'm looking forward to the next fortnight.' The admission came as the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg accused Mr Farage of being an 'odious Victor Meldrew' character. In an interview with MailOnline, Mr Clegg said Mr Farage's 'mask is slipping' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white 'lashing out' in a scrabble for headlines. The Lib Dem leader condemned David Cameron's appeal to UKIP supporters to 'come home', warning the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' which is losing all grip on the party.

The Lib Dem leader condemned David Cameron's appeal to UKIP supporters to 'come home', warning the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' which is losing all grip on the party. It came after Mr Farage called for any migrants rescued from the Mediterranean to be sent back to Africa. The Ukip leader said 'millions' of refugees could arrive on boats in Europe over the next few years unless they are intercepted and turned back now. Mr Farage urged Prime Minister David Cameron to resist pressure at an emergency summit of EU leaders in Brussels tomorrow for Britain to take in large numbers of refugees brought across the Mediterranean by people-smugglers. Mr Farage urged David Cameron - pictured with Boris Johnson campaigning in London today - to resist pressure at an emergency summit of EU leaders in Brussels tomorrow for Britain to take in large numbers of refugees . He insisted the UK could not take more than 'a few thousand' genuine refugees. His comments came as experts warned that up to 30,000 migrants, including 2,500 children, could be killed this year unless the crisis is tackled. Up to 950 people are believed to have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Libya on Saturday, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Just 28 people are known to have survived the tragedy, described by UNHCR as 'the deadliest incident in the Mediterranean we have ever recorded'. However, a major survey published today suggested Mr Farage's hard-line immigration stance was popular with the public. Nick Clegg said the Ukip leader was an 'odious' man . Barely one in ten electors say they are satisfied with Conservative border policies over the past five years. The poll by Ipsos MORI suggests this unhappiness may be the key factor behind large numbers of Conservative voters switching to Ukip. Of those who supported David Cameron in 2010, but now intend to vote for Mr Farage's party, 94 per cent are dissatisfied with immigration policy. This compared to 45 per cent of voters sticking with the Tories. This loss of voters to Ukip could be crucial in deciding the outcome of the General Election on May 7 – with the Prime Minister now facing a race against time to win them back. For all voters, six in ten electors say they are unhappy about the Tories handling of the nation's borders. A significant number of voters also insist immigration is still not being discussed enough by the politicians. During the current campaign, the Tories, Labour and Liberal Democrats have all avoided talking about the subject. The poll will now put pressure on the Prime Minister to change course and begin promoting his policies – which are far tougher than any advocated by Labour. The public considers Labour and the Tories to be just as bad as one another when it comes to getting a grip. Alarmingly for Mr Cameron, only 27 per cent think the current government's handling of immigration has been better than under the previous Labour government – and 26 per cent say they're handling it worse. The rest say both are the same. This is despite the fact Labour presided over a policy of open borders in which record numbers were allowed to pour into the UK.","Ukip leader 'confessed' that he preferred some migrants to others .

The waitress - believed to be working at a cafe called Rosie in Parnell, east of Auckland - wrote about she how made it very clear that she was unimpressed by Mr Key's gestures. 'He was like the school yard bully tugging on the little girls' hair trying to get a reaction, experiencing that feeling of power over her,' she wrote on the blog. Mr Key kept being persistent with his hair-pulling antics, despite being told by his wife Bronagh to stop. After dealing with the practical jokes over the six months he had visited the cafe, the waitress finally lost her cool. 'As he made his way out the door I said after him ""Please STOP or I will actually hit you soon!"",' she wrote. 'Everybody knew that I didn't like it, I really didn't like it. I felt powerless and tormented and I stepped out the back and I cried frustrated tears.'

"They are supposed to be the dream team who can solve the conundrum of how to win the election. But David Cameron and Boris Johnson were left scratching their heads today as they struggled with a children's jigsaw teaching toddlers about the seasons. As the London Mayor tried to hammer ill-fitting pieces together with his hands, the Prime Minister tried out what could be a new election slogan, telling him: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' After being put right by a four-year-old who spotted their errors, the pair had more fun finger painting with Tory blue paint. David Cameron and Boris Johnson were left stumped by the puzzle at Advantage Children's Day Nursery in Surbiton, as three-year-old Stephanie looked on . When they tried to put the puzzle back together, they hit trouble after it proved to be more difficult than expected . The Conservative duo made their first appearance together on the campaign trail with a visit to Advantage day nursery in Surbiton, south west London. They were supposed to be highlighting Tory plans to double free childcare for 600,000 children aged three and four. They sat at a table with Joshua and Stephanie, both aged three, and four-year-olds Hamish and Leo where they broke up a puzzle which depicted the four seasons. When they tried to put it back together, they hit trouble after it proved to be more difficult than expected. After taking nine minutes to complete the puzzle, the Tory duo were relieved to try their hand at hand painting, which they found much easier . The pair were at the nursery in Surbiton to promote a Tory pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week . Arriving at the nursery, Mr Cameron appeared to be giving Mr Johnson a ticking off before the visit had even started . Like a bad workman blaming his tools, Mr Johnson soon started to question whether there was a fundamental design fault. 'January is in winter,' he complained. 'There's something wrong with the puzzle.' The clock ticked on and Tory aides grew nervous, as Mr Cameron insisted: We've got all day.' Mr Johnson, fearing defeat, was adamant: 'We can't be beaten by the puzzle.' With the media crowding into classroom, Hamish asked Mr Cameron why there were so many journalists. 'If we finish the puzzle it will make them go away,' the PM said. But the children had spotted more errors. 'I've found another problem,' said Leo. Mr Johnson, already known as a political heavyweight, then tried brute force to get the pieces to fit by hammering them with his fist. He had the backing of the PM who declared: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' Samantha Cameron got into less mess with blue paint during a visit to The Growing Zone allotment project in Kippax, West Yorkshire . Fearing it might be taking too long, and perhaps that the puzzle might get broken, a teacher then stepped in to point out yet more problems. 'This one is not right,' she said. 'This one goes there.' As the last piece went in to cheers - nearly nine minutes after they began - Mr Cameron initiated a group hug. 'Thank God for that. That was stressful,' he said. 'I do have to have a hug after that.' Mr Johnson joked: 'That was a bit like the (election) campaign ... suddenly, the final surge.' 'It all comes together in the end,' said Mr Cameron, before stopping one of the children taking the puzzle to pieces. 'Don't break it up again - I can't take the stress.' Afterwards the two men joined another group of children for a hand painting session - appropriately using blue paint.","David Cameron and Boris Johnson visit nursery to promote childcare .

"The belief that the most popular antidepressant drugs raise serotonin levels in the brain is nothing more than a myth, a leading professor of psychiatry has claimed. David Healy, head of psychiatry at the Hergest psychiatric unit in Bangor, North Wales, said the misconception that low levels of serotonin were responsible for depression had become established fact. He suggested that the success of so-called SSRI drugs – which include Prozac and Seroxat – was based on the ‘marketing of a myth’. Scroll down for video . The idea that the most popular antidepressant drugs raise serotonin levels in the brain is nothing more than a myth, psychiatrist Professor David Healy argues. Pictured is Prozac, one commonly prescribed  SSRI . The emergence of these serotonin reuptake inhibiting (SSRI) drugs in the late 1980s came after concerns about tranquilliser use to treat depression. Even though they were weaker than old-style tricyclic antidepressants, they took off because of the idea that SSRIs restored serotonin levels to normal, ‘a notion that later transmuted into the idea that they remedied a chemical imbalance’. In an editorial in the BMJ, Professor Healy said that in the 1990s, no one knew if SSRIs raised or lowered serotonin levels but there was no evidence that treatment corrected anything. He said: ‘For doctors it provided an easy short hand for communication with patients. ‘For patients, the idea of correcting an abnormality has a moral force that can be expected to overcome the scruples some might have had about taking a tranquilliser, especially when packaged in the appealing form that distress is not a weakness.’ However, other psychiatrists have refuted the professor’s claims, saying the profession has moved on from a simplistic description of the pills correcting a chemical imbalance. They warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs, which had been proved to work in trials and the ‘real world’. Depression should be re-defined as an infectious disease rather than an emotional disorder, argues one scientist. The condition could result from a parasitic, bacterial or viral infection and future research into the condition should search for these micro-organisms, argues Dr. Turhan Canli, of Stony Brook University, U.S. If his theory is true, he hopes a vaccination to protect against depression could be developed in future. Writing in the journal Biology of Mood and Anxiety Disorders, Dr Canli said: 'It is time for an entirely different approach. 'Instead of conceptualising major depression as an emotional disorder, I suggest to re-conceptualise it as some form of an infectious disease. 'I propose that future research should conduct a concerted search for parasites, bacteria, or viruses that may play a causal role in the etiology of major depression.' Professor Sir Simon Wessely, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ‘That antidepressants are helpful in depression, together with psychological treatments, is established. How they do this is not. ‘Most researchers have long since moved on from the old serotonin model. ‘Most important of all, SSRIs are safer if taken in overdose than the older tricyclics. ‘People should not change their current medication on the basis of this editorial alone.’ NHS Choices, the website which advises patients, says: ‘It would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms.’ Professor Healy’s editorial says it is important to raise questions about the drugs. He said: ‘In other areas of life the products we use, from computers to microwaves, improve year on year, but this is not the case for medicines, where this year’s treatments may achieve blockbuster sales despite being less effective and less safe than yesterday’s models. ‘The emerging sciences of the brain offer enormous scope to deploy any amount of neurobabble. 'We need to understand the language we use. Until then, so long, and thanks for all the serotonin’, he concludes. Professor David Taylor, Director of Pharmacy and Pathology and Head of Pharmaceutical Sciences Clinical Academic Group, King’s Health Partners, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘Professor Healy makes a forceful but poorly supported argument against something which doesn’t and has never really existed: the idea that SSRIs ‘correct’ an ‘imbalance’ of serotonin in the brain. ‘Researchers and psychiatrists alike know that SSRIs are effective in a number of disorders but no one is sure exactly how they work. Their readily demonstrable effect is on serotonin but they have many indirect secondary effects in the brain. Other psychiatrists warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs, which had been proved to work in trials and the ‘real world’ ‘Prof Healy fails to mention that SSRIs supplanted earlier tricyclics largely because of their relative safety in overdose, not because of any conspiracy concerning a theory of serotonin’s involvement in depression.’ Dr Paul Keedwell, Consultant Psychiatrist and Specialist in Mood Disorders, said: ‘In the real world of the clinic, SSRIs are undeniably effective in treating individuals with major depression. 'They have become the first line treatment of choice because they have fewer troublesome side-effects than their predecessors, and are safer in overdose. ‘David Healy has previously claimed that SSRIs cause dependence or provoke suicide. ‘In so doing he has risked deterring individuals with severe depression from getting the help they need and this latest article just adds to this problem. ‘The risk of suicide from untreated depression is much greater than the risk of treating it with antidepressants, and yes, this includes SSRIs.’","David Healy is head of psychiatry at the Hergest psychiatry unit in Bangor .

"A remarkable farming couple  have devoted their lives to adopting disabled orphans - taking in more than 40 children over the last 26 years. Tianwen Chen, 65, and his wife Gairen Guo, 60, found their first child in a box on the roadside and gradually took  more and more disabled children into their two-bedroom home in rural Shanxi province, central China. But the couple have faced a great deal of heartache over the years, and are only now living comfortably with 12 of the children with the help of donations by kind-hearted people, according to the People's Daily Online. Big family: Tianwen Chen and his wife Gairen Guo have adopted 40 disabled children over the past 26 years. Nine of the children can be seen here, enjoying a family meal together . Working hard: The Chens can now afford to send their children to school, but it hasn't always been this way . The couple, who live outside of Yuanping city, found their first child - a baby girl -  on the side of the road one day in 1989 and carried her home, despite not having much to live on themselves. Tianwen said he immediately felt an emotional connection with the child: 'This baby girl was in a cardboard box. She was so tiny and skinny. Both of her legs were weird and you could tell at first glance that she was disabled.' 'When I saw this baby girl, I felt like I had been through the same things.’ Difficult life: All of the  children were disabled and many had been abandoned by their biological parents . Devoted: Tianwen says he was desperate to help  and began to take more and more children into their home . Ever-growing: The couple said that even the local authorities began sending children to their home . He suffers from a genetic eye condition, and says that this made him desperately want to help disabled children. Eventually, nearly 20  children were sleeping on the floor in their 20 square metre farmhouse. The couple themselves had barely any space to lie down. They would take it in turn to wake up three or four times every night to feed the babies and change their nappies. The couple did not even have a washing machine, and Gairen was forced her laundry in icy water that was often -20 degrees Celsius. Even the local authorities began to send disabled children to the Chens, but unfortunately the government subsidy for foster parents only covered the cost of milk powder. The couple gradually used up all their savings, making them fear for the future of their children. Caring: Tianwen, feeding one of the babies above, found a baby girl in a box on the side of the road . Grief: Sadly nine of the children died. The parents still visit their tombs to carry out religious rituals . The children needed constant medical treatment, which became extremely expensive. The couple went with various children to the doctor twice a week and every day during flu season. The healthiest child had a cleft lip and palate. Sadly, nine of the children died and another 12 were adopted by other families. None of their neighbours were willing to help and it became too much for the eldest son - who decided to get up and leave. But a short online film telling the story of the Chens has changed their lives forever. The documentary called 'Fading flowers’ gained a huge amount of support and nearly £14,000 was raised to buy the family a new 500 square metre home. The children have also been able to receive proper medical treatment, and five of them have had their disabilities corrected. Today, the couple have 12 children living with them - the eldest is 16, and the youngest is 6. Gairen said it's all been worth it: 'As long as we live, we will care for the children.’ Happier times: 12  children still live with the couple and can now receive proper treatment due to generous donations from the public . New home: A short film telling the family's story received tremendous support online, raising £14,000 . Good education: The couple still hope to send the children to school in the city .","Tianwen Chen and wife found a baby girl in a box by the road in 1989 .

"Prince William, dutiful fellow that he is, has announced that he will be taking six weeks of paternity leave. God willing, his wife the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to their next child in a few days’ time, at which point the Prince, having been excused from training with East Anglia Air Ambulance, will roll up the sleeves of his Viyella shirt and tell his beloved as she lies, exhausted, on her maternity hospital bed: ‘O duchess of my dreams, I am at your beck and call, coiled like a watchspring to hold milk bottles and change nappies until the first week of June’. Six weeks! Some of you may find this sweet. You will look at the earnest young Duke of C, with his well-meaning smile and that receding hairline (join the club, sir), and you may think: ‘There goes a properly modern man; what a fine example he sets to the rising generation.’ Scroll down for video . 'He may be a prince of the realm, but under it all he is a new man, bowing to convention like a willow branch in the flood,' says Quentin Letts of Prince William's six weeks' paternity leave . You will toast him in whatever it is that you spongy egalitarians use for toasts — some form of low-calorie herbal infusion, perhaps — and you may even allow yourselves a small ‘ahhh’ of sentimentalism. How lovely, you will say, that the next-but-heir to the throne is in tune with metropolitan sensibilities, alive to the rip-tides of 21st-century cultural politics. He may be a prince of the realm, surrounded by hot-and-cold-running flunkeys, cocooned by the coroneted appurtenances of royal life, but under it all he is a new man, bowing to convention like a willow branch in the flood. How unlike his father, the fogeyish Prince Charles — who at the time of his engagement to Diana, when asked if he was in love, gave a sighing, unromantic answer which included the throwaway phrase ‘whatever “in love” means’. Unlike his mouldering Pop, Wills accepts — embraces! — the mundane and sometimes stinky burdens of early parenthood. And so, for the next six weeks, and possibly beyond, the Prince will be on domestic parade, quivering to attention at the nursery door somewhere deep inside their stately home, Anmer Hall, in Norfolk, like a guardsman doing sentry duty outside St James’s Palace. HRH New Dad, in his nursemaid’s pinny, will be there to ‘do his bit’. And yet, at the risk of committing lese-majeste, I must confess that when I heard of the Prince’s undertaking I thought (and continue to think): ‘For God’s sake, man, are you MAD?’ I say this, furthermore, as a committed royalist and father of three. 'For the next six weeks, and possibly beyond, the Prince will be on domestic parade,' says Quentin Letts. 'Quivering to attention at the nursery door somewhere deep inside their stately home, Anmer Hall, in Norfolk' For your Royal Highness, I have been there and have glimpsed your immediate future. I have tried paternity leave, albeit briefly. So far as I could see it was an almost complete waste of time. Our first-born, Claud, arrived in July 1997, in the early days of the Blairite terrors. New Labour had been in office but a few weeks and the country was in the grip of a mini social revolution that saw the old Tory ways washed aside by political correctness. Even so, I absented myself from the birthing suite at Cheltenham maternity hospital (I had nearly fainted when the anaesthetist produced his epidural needle, long as a medieval jousting stick). I retired to a nearby pub for a pint or two of goodish cider. As I made my excuses and left the hospital, the midwives looked thoroughly relieved. They knew what no nurse ever seems prepared in public to admit: men in a maternity ward are a flat-footed menace. 'They knew what no nurse ever seems prepared in public to admit: men in a maternity ward are a flat-footed menace,' says Quentin Letts, who says he made it through just a week of his own paternity leave . I can claim to have changed Claud’s first nappy — I remember the moment vividly, as my wife looked on cluelessly — and I also made myself uncharacteristically useful when, the following morning, the three of us went home. You see, I was the one who worked out how to fasten the darn babyseat into the front seat of our elderly Mini estate car. OK, it took me ten minutes to work it out but at least, like Wills with Prince George, I did it! We lived at that point in a small cottage on a wooded hillside near Stroud, Gloucestershire, reached only by a steep footpath. For William and Kate, home is the rather better-appointed Anmer, an elegant, Georgian spread on the Sandringham estate. Will William need to carry the new-born bundle and its baby clobber (nappy bags, push chair, cot, toys, etc) down the garden path, as I did? One suspects there may be staff to do that. Once the newborn has been brought home, what is there for the father to do? Feeding the bairn? My wife opted for breast-feeding. My man boobs may be corkers in their own right but they were never up to that task, so I had little to do. Some women go in for breast pumps and decanting their milk into bottles, which the dads can then administer, but that all sounded a bit complicated to us — to be honest, it made me feel a bit faint. At Anmer Hall, there will surely be cohorts of nurses and Norland-trained nannies on hand to take over from Kate when she tires of feeding the little one. My mother-in-law, who had been my wife’s birthing partner, was busy and helpful in the first days after the babies arrived. Ah, the mother-in-law. We touch here, perhaps, on terrain that will be familiar to William, whose own ma-in-law, the indomitable Carole Middleton, is said to be in the Jimmy Anderson league of fast bowlers. 'Once the newborn has been brought home, what is there for the father to do?' asks Quentin Letts . Mrs Middleton, one is told, will be on hand at Anmer, once the young royals return to the family pile. When one hears of the proximity of mothers-in-law and gormless, bumbling sons-in-law, one fears a conflagration may break out as easily as if Russian and RAF jets are in close proximity in the skies over north-eastern Scotland. A man may love his wife’s mother, and that affection may even sometimes be reciprocated, but that is not to say it is a good idea for him to try to disagree with her when it comes to theories about how to hold a baby, lay it in its cot or bring up wind. Burping procedures: is this what search-and-rescue helicopter pilot William was put on earth to do? Mrs Middleton may not be a member of the blood royal but I suspect that if it came to a shoot-out between her and William over babysitting niceties, she would take the bout with ease. For this is what a man learns while on paternity leave: he is there on sufferance. The early weeks of motherhood lean heavily to the distaff side. In July 1997, your correspondent stood there, like any man, feeling a spare part as the aunts and grandmothers and godmothers and female neighbours fell to their cooing and gurgling at the purple-faced infant. Worse, these women were keen to discuss the complete biological aspects of the delivery. The expression ‘give us all the gory details’ rings still in my ear as my wife’s girlfriends descended on her with presents of Babygros and ‘moisturiser for your stretch marks’. 'Those first weeks after a birth, a mother and babe spend much of their time resting and sleeping. If a man can go and earn a few bob to help pay the flurry of bills, is he not better thus employed?' Descriptions of shrieking agony in the delivery room unfolded, complete with Dante-esque accounts of pushing and dilation and heads appearing. Worst of all, they wanted to know about ‘tearing’. A paternity-leave dad such as Prince William has two options: he can stand in the margins of such covens, and possibly disgrace himself by fainting, floored by the nausea of envisaging post-natal undercarriage surgery; or he can step into the garden (better still a beer garden) for some fresh air. I lasted less than a week first time round. For the second and third children, I made admiring noises, told my wife how wonderful she was, took a vague squint at the infant, then returned to my work. Those first weeks after a birth, a mother and babe spend much of their time resting and sleeping. If a man can go and earn a few bob to help pay the flurry of bills, is he not better thus employed? You can do a lot in six weeks. If you are a sailor you can cross the Atlantic and have time for a few days on some West Indies beach. If you are a cyclist you can go from Land’s End to John O’Groats and quite a long way back, depending on the gravity of your jock rot. By mid-June, early spuds will be ready for digging in our kitchen gardens. The new Parliament will be up and running. Buckingham Palace will be in summer garden-party season. England’s cricketers may already be two down in the series against New Zealand. Prince William, sir, ignore your press officers and image advisers. Don’t fall for this notion that a new dad’s place is at the (stately) home. You will have a whole life ahead for bonding with your lovely new child. Stay just long enough to show affectionate interest. Then make your escape!","Prince William has announced he'll be taking six weeks of paternity leave .

But Quentin Letts, father of three, says the Prince must be mad!"
"When 18-year-old Jackson Byrnes was told he had only weeks to live, only one surgeon in Australia was willing to perform the surgery that would either save his life, leave him paralysed or worse. Incredibly, the teenager has woken up from having his catastrophic brain tumour removed with the ability to move his body, thank his surgeon and even to ask his relieved mother for food. ‘It’s such a relief, it’s just amazing. Jackson is a fighter!’ his mother Rhonda told Daily Mail Australia. His elated family are ‘over the moon’ that the surgery was more of a success than they dared to even dream it would be. In recovery, Jackson opened his eyes surrounded by his surgeon and family, who had been trying to prepare themselves for bad news. Jackson Byrnes, 18, underwent a risky operation to remove the tumour on his brain on Wednesday. it has been an enormous success . Renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo is the only surgeon in Australia who was willing to perform the risky operation that will hopefully buy Jackson more time . ‘The surgeon told Jackson to try and lift up his arm. And he did! Like that! We couldn’t believe it,’ his mother said. ‘And then he turned his head to the surgeon, Dr Teo, and said thank you. It was such a beautiful moment.’ Jackson's story made national headlines this week, with strangers digging deep to help the family, donating more than $95,000 in just over a week. Thousands of people helped to fund Jackson’s $80,000 operation and contribute to other medical costs. On Wednesday, his loved ones waited for seven anxious hours as world-renowned surgeon Dr Charlie Teo operated on the teen at the Prince of Wales hospital in Sydney’s east. Three weeks ago the teen from Casino in NSW's north was told by doctors that he had a stage four brain tumour that was too deep and aggressive to be safely operated on. Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said she was overwhelmed by the support and money raised by the community on his GoFundMe page to help fun the crucial $80,000 operation . His family refused to accept the dismal diagnosis and took matters into their own hands and found Dr Teo, who said he was willing to perform the operation if the family understood the risks. Renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo was the only surgeon in Australia willing to perform the risky operation that will likely see the Casino teenager paralysed. ‘We were told he would probably wake up and be paralysed down his left side. That was so hard to hear but we really had no choice in the end,' Rhonda told Daily Mail Australia. ‘We would have lost him, we had to take that chance.’ ‘I didn’t know where the hell I’d get the money, I just knew I have it no matter what. I would have gone to the ends of the earth for him,’ Rhonda said. Dr Teo told Daily Mail Australia that he hopes the surgery will buy the teen more time. 'If you can buy him time with surgery then the hope is you're going to get a good response to the chemotherapy and radiotherapy and a significant extension of time,' he said. 'Even if we could buy him six months of life the hope is we're going to come up with new treatment in that time.' Dr Teo said the $80,000 payment required for the surgery was standard. The 18-year-old (pictured left, getting his head shaved) at a recent fundraising event . The Byrnes family have already endured the ‘four weeks from hell’. It was an emotion-filled moment on Wednesday morning as they waited for Jackson to go into theatre at 9.30am. ‘We all had so much anxiety before the surgery. It was a seven hour long procedure and the unknown was driving me crazy,’ said Rhonda on Wednesday night. ‘Before he went in he said he was anxious. Not knowing what he’s up for.’ ‘He was a bit upset before the surgery. He went really quiet. We were trying not to be scared,’ said his 17-year-old little brother Maton. ‘But everyone was just focussed on believing that he was going to come out of the surgery alright.’ It was a tense wait for his family and loved ones. ‘I couldn’t stop thinking about him in there all by himself, even though I knew he was in the best of hands,’ said Rhonda. Jackson needs $80,000 by Tuesday night in order to pay for his surgery upfront, and another $45,00 for fees . But it wasn't long before the Byrnes family were laughing again. Rhonda couldn’t believe it when, after such an intense surgery, her cheeky son was back to his old tricks. She had quickly ducked away from the hospital after visiting her son in recovery. Jackson’s name popped up on Rhonda’s phone screen. ‘I thought it would be his girlfriend Jahnae calling to update me on his condition after such an intense surgery,’ Rhonda said. ‘Instead I heard Jackson’s voice and he said to me: “Mum, hi! What are you up to? I feel great, but I’m really hungry,”’ Rhonda laughs. ‘He was just talking like normal and looking for food. We had been to told to expect he’d be paralysed! There is still a long road to go for young Jackson, much of it unknown. ‘Four weeks ago he was a fit young fellow and had his own future ahead of him,’ Rhonda said. Dr Teo will try to remove 95 per cent of the tumour, which has extended to very sensitive part of the brain . ‘He’s still fighting, it is overwhelming.’ The family have gained strength from the love and support they have received from thousands of people who have rallied around them. ‘It’s incredible to have everyone coming together for us. Our phone has been running hot, even from strangers calling wanting to help however they can or see how Jackson is,’ said Rhonda. ‘It makes us so happy. I don’t know how we could have done it without ‘Team Jacko’. Jackson’s heartbroken mother Rhonda had been told the incredibly risky surgery. After a tense seven hour long wake, Jackson woke But when Jackson woke up, the was told to try and lift his left arm and he did! Then he turned his head to Dr Teo and said thank you. It was such a beautiful moment. At the end of a long day, . We all had so much anxiety before the surgery.

I couldn’t stop thinking about him in there all by himself, even though I knew he was in the best of hands. No one else would operate, they wouldn’t even attempt. It was an enormous relief when Dr Teo took on his surgery, words can’t describe the relief. The response from everybody – including so many strangers – has been amazing, . Dr Teo had predicted that he would remove 95 per cent of the tumour. Most of the tumour has been successfully removed but the Byrnes family are yet exactly how much.

Amy later composed herself just in time to pose alongside movie hunk Bradley Cooper, 40, and showed off lots of cleavage in her tight fishtail frock, accessorizing with a small pink handbag. Meanwhile, fellow honoree Laverne Cox could be seen behind the group on the red carpet laughing at the entire incident. Also getting a laugh out of Schumer's pratfall was Kardashian's bodyguard Pascal Duvier, who could be seen giggling at the prank.

She goes, ""Oh my god, I was like, does this girl need help?"" She was like, ""That was really funny."" It's a big night for Kim and Yeezy as the couple are among those named individually as 'Titans' in the weekly publication. Others who were named 'Titans' included Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Lee Daniels, and restaurateur Danny Meyer of Shake Shack fame. Great to see you!: Kim and Katie Couric showed they have ended their feud once and for all . All is forgiven: The reality star called the journalist a 'fake friend' for sending her daughter North West a gift after saying she doesn't 'understand' why the Kardashians are 'so famous' Say cheese: Kim snapped a photo of Kanye posing with Martha Stewart, who wrote about her for the magazine . West was also featured on one-of-five special edition covers for the Thursday April 16 issue, along with Bradley Cooper, journalist Jorge Ramos, Ruth Bader Ginsberg and ballerina Misty Copeland. The annual list is assembled by the American news magazine and has featured several big names since it was first published in 1999 including: Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, Hillary Clinton and Steve Jobs. Winfrey and Obama have both appeared on the list ten times, while Clinton has been named on nine different occasions.

This year that included Taylor Swift writing about Barefoot Contessa Ina Garten, Karlie Kloss penning an ode to designer Alexander Wang, and Tilda Swinton honoring Schumer with a poem. Martha Stewart meanwhile wrote about Kardashian and tech billionaire Elon Musk about West. Honorees fall into one of five categories; Titans, Pioneers, Artists, Leaders or Icons.

As for Schumer,  season three of her adult comedy Inside Amy Schumer premiered Tuesday night, and Comedy Central has already renewed the show for a fourth season. Schumer has also been busy promoting her first movie, Trainwreck. That semi-romantic comedy, written by Schumer and directed by Judd Apatow, will be released on July 17.

In her interview with the late night host, she discussed how uncomfortable she is around celebrities - sharing a story about how she hid and yelled out Bradley Cooper's name while backstage at the MTV Movie Awards. Letterman then urged her to do something she would later regret, at which point she lifted her skirt and pointed to a scar, saying: 'See that scar? That's my vagina.' The actress has been hitting most of the major talk shows leading up to her show's premiere, and two weeks ago had Ellen DeGeneres in tears as she discussed how out of place she feels in Los Angeles. Everyone else thought it was funny! While the reality star managed a little smile, Yeezy remained stony-faced throughout . Schmoozing: The Trainwreck star regained her composure to pose alongside Bradley Cooper . She recalled one time when she attended a Los Angeles Lakers game and was mortified when she later learned photographers had been taking her photo as she ate handfuls of popcorn. Schumer appeared on the fifth season of the NBC reality show Last Comic Standing in 2007, with her fourth place finish securing her a spot on a national tour that ultimately shot her to fame. She had bit parts on shows including 30 Rock, Girls, Louie and Curb Your Enthusiasm before her own show premiered in April 2013.

"A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video . Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner . 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona . 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin . Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week . 'If I hadn’t had [my friend’s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, ""Wow!""' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.","Skin Laundry, a trendy new skin clinic in Manhattan, offers a ten-minute laser facial which promises to tighten skin .

"A young Star Wars fan, who wrote a heartwarming note to the movies’ creator George Lucas asking whether he would allow Jedi Knights to marry in the future, was elated to receive a reply granting his request. Seven-year-old Colin Gilpatric, an aspiring Jedi Knight, was devastated to learn that achieving his dream might mean never being able to marry, as forming emotional attachments is said by the rules of the fictional order to lead Jedis to the 'dark side'. Desperate for a solution, Colin, who has autism, went directly to the man in charge: Star Wars director and writer Mr Lucas. Plea by post: Seven-year-old aspiring Jedi Colin sent a letter to George Lucas asking him to change the rule that bans the Knights from marrying . As character Anakin Skywalker's marriage to Princess Amidala led him to become a villain - and lord of the malevolent Sith Order, Darth Vader - Colin wanted to avoid the same fate, and pleaded with the Star Wars creator to make a change to the rules. 'With Colin, he was obsessing about it,' Colin's mother Peggy Gilpatric told Inside Edition: 'Finally, I was like, you know what, write to George Lucas and tell him how you feel and that's all that you can do.' 'Dear George Lucas,' Colin wrote in his letter. 'I don't like that a Jedi cannot get married. I want to get married without becoming a Sith. Please change the rule. 'P.S. I want to come to Skywalker Ranch please, Love Colin.' Soon enough, a package from Lucasfilm arrived for Colin in the mail, and his mother Peggy was on hand to film him opening it up. The letter: Colin, desperate not to end up like Anakin Skywalker - aka Darth Vader - in the film series, made his case to the Star Wars creator . The big reveal: Colin's mother filmed her son's ecstatic response as he realizes the package contains a plethora of Star Wars merchandise . In the video, Colin is ecstatic to find a stash of Star Wars goodies in the bag, including books and toys, accompanied by a letter addressing his question. 'It sounds like the Force is strong with you, and you are showing great wisdom by asking your question,' it said. 'To be a Jedi is to truly know the value of friendship, of compassion, and of loyalty, and these are values important in a marriage. The Sith think inward, only of themselves. 'When you find someone that you can connect to in a selfless way, then you are on the path of the light, and the dark side will not take hold of you. With this goodness in your heart, you can be married.' The letter was signed 'Your friends at Lucasfilm'. 'The Force is strong with me!': Colin is elated to have his question answered . Quite the response: Lucasfilm sent this letter to seven-year-old Colin to ease his mind about one day being able to get married . In the video showing Colin reading the letter for the first time, the young fan is delighted to say the least, exclaiming: 'I can get married? No way!' According to Colin's mother, the obsession with Star Wars has been a godsend for her son, who, as a result of his autism, struggles to share his emotions. 'A lot of autistic kids have a hard time understand processing emotions and the entire Star Wars universe has helped us that way,'she told Inside Edition. 'It’s very black and white. There’s a dark side and good side. 'It helped open up a dialogue about it feelings and emotions. There is a conception that some autistic kids don’t have emotions, but they do. It’s just finding the right outlet for them and the right way to express it.'","Traditional Jedi rules forbid any knights from marrying because it is thought it will lead them to the ‘dark side’

"Eleven leading figures from nine parties have written a joint letter questioning the CPS's decision not to prosecute Lord Janner for child abuse . Leading politicians from seven parties have come together to attack the decision not to prosecute Lord Janner over child abuse and accused the CPS of orchestrating a 'whitewash'. Putting the election aside, 11 leading figures said that Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was ‘damaging public confidence’ in the justice system with her ruling. The CPS has been accused of double standards for not prosecuting Lord Janner after it emerged at least 19 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010, including ten in the past year. MailOnline has revealed that some paedophiles, including several too ill to enter a plea, have still been prosecuted and in some cases jailed for the rest of their lives because of historic sex attacks. But Alison Saunders and the CPS insist Lord Janner cannot face prosecution. Politicians have written to a national newspaper to demand the decision be reversed amid public concerns. The cross-party group, led by Labour’s Simon Danczuk, asked in their letter to The Times: ‘Have we learnt anything from the mistakes of the past? ‘As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.’ Mrs Saunders announced last week that 86-year-old Labour peer Lord Janner, who has dementia, would not face trial over 22 serious offences against nine alleged victims in Leicestershire, from the 1960s to the 1980s. The intervention was co-ordinated by Mr Danczuk, who investigated the Cyril Smith abuse scandal in Rochdale and the subsequent cover-up. Mrs Saunders’ decision has already drawn criticism from Home Secretary Theresa May. Police are considering a legal challenge, and Lord Macdonald of River Glaven, a former director of public prosecutions, has also questioned the decision. Last night a former president of the Law Society said the Crown Prosecution Service had failed in its duty to put suspected wrongdoers before the courts. Simon Danczuk (left) lead the intervention, that was also backed by the likes of Tory Zac Goldsmith (right), Green MP Caroline Lucas, Ukip's Mark Reckless and John Hemming from the Liberal Democrats . Linda Lee, who now represents victims and witnesses, said: ‘Alison Saunders may well be right that Lord Janner is not fit to stand trial but it should not be a matter for her to decide. 'The matter should be brought before the courts so that the evidence may be tested in accordance with the law. ‘This case clearly demonstrates why victims of abuse feel let down by the system.’ Leicestershire Police told The Times they were concerned about alleged improper attempts by a member of the Bar to influence key legal decisions in their investigation into Lord Janner and other suspects. A spokesman said: ‘We are aware of this barrister and had concerns but were assured the CPS were dealing with this matter.’ The CPS said no improper attempts had been made to influence Mrs Saunders. A spokesman said: ‘The DPP was not unduly influenced by anyone when making this decision. As head of the CPS — an independent prosecuting authority — the DPP is used to making difficult decisions and will continue to do so independently.’ The letter accuses Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders (pictured) of 'damaging public confidence'  with her ruling that Lord Janner is unfit to be prosecuted due to his Alzheimer's . A procedure exists to deal with criminal suspects thought to have mental illness. In serious cases where a judge rules a suspect is not fit to stand trial a jury can hear the evidence in the suspect’s absence and decide if the individual committed the crimes. A suspect is not found to be guilty, or not guilty, but a jury do rule on if they have committed the crimes. Often the judge will order them be detained in hospital, often indefinitely. The patient's discharge, transfer or leave of absence from hospital cannot be without the consent of the Secretary of State. Lord Janner’s family has said that the former Leicester West MP is a man of the ‘highest integrity’ who is ‘totally innocent of any wrongdoing’. The peer was found to have Alzheimer’s disease in 2009 but continued to speak in the House of Lords until December 2013. He stopped attending in the week  police searched his home in Hampstead, north London, and later took formal leave of absence. That leave was renewed this month when Lord Janner signed a letter to House of Lords clerks. The full list of signatories to The Times letter is: Mr Danczuk (Labour); John Mann (Labour); John Hemming (Liberal Democrat); Zac Goldsmith (Conservative); Nadine Dorries (Conservative); Mark Reckless (Ukip); Caroline Lucas (Green); Naomi Long (Alliance party); Jim Shannon (DUP); Sarah Wollaston (Conservative); Tessa Munt (Liberal Democrat). Case: The CPS has decided not to prosecute Lord Janner over alleged child sex offences but 19 others with dementia have been pursued in recent years . The CPS has been accused of double standards for not prosecuting Lord Janner after it emerged at least 19 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010, including ten in the past year. MailOnline can reveal that some paedophiles, including several too ill to enter a plea, have still been prosecuted and in some cases jailed for the rest of their lives because of historic sex attacks. On Friday Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, concluded that former Labour MP Lord Janner's dementia made him unfit to plead on 22 historic child sex offences between 1969 and 1988. She decided there was no public interest in prosecuting Janner because of his illness, yet the CPS' latest prosecution of a dementia sufferer on sex charges came in February. Two months ago Roy Shaw, 68, was considered unfit to plead to child sex charges against him but was tried by a jury anyway for sex attacks dating back to 2013, and detained in a hospital indefinitely under the mental health act. Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood said: ‘This is certainly double standards by the CPS. Of course any right thinking person knows deep down there is a cover up here. ‘The cases MailOnline has uncovered prove that and I believe there are more. I believe he’s being protected. ‘There is unease that someone as influential and high profile as Lord Janner will not face trial when Joe Bloogs has. It is very convenient that the CPS finally admits he should have been prosecuted just a the time when they say they can’t. ‘People are worried about the beans he might spill should he be brought to trial’. In January paedophile John Hayford, 84, who has dementia and Alzheimer's, was jailed for two years for abusing a seven-year-old 20 years ago in Stanmore, London. Cases: Last year William Chamberlain, 66, left,  and Joseph Birtles, 81, right, both of whom have dementia, were told they may die in jail for abusing children and given prison sentences . He was sentenced two months after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting a girl, nine, in a supermarket. In December Swindon pensioner William Chamberlain, 66, an alcoholic with dementia, was told he may die in prison after he was found to have abused a girl from the age of five, threatening to kill her family if she told them. A judge jailed him for eight years and eight months and told him he stole the girl's innocence. Last August Joseph Birtles, 81, a retired primary school teacher who abused children as young as eight over 20 years, was convicted of 15 counts of indecent assault on seven victims. His defence team pleaded for 'mercy' because of his dementia and other illnesses but he was jailed for seven years  at the Old Bailey and told he would likely die in prison. The contrast with Janner's case has caused fury among his victims and campaigners and came as it emerged the politician, diagnosed with dementia in 2009, has claimed tens of thousands of pounds in expenses in recent years. He voted in the House of Lords 37 times in 2013 and took a formal leave of absence last October. When asked if he would consider retiring when the election was called, he responded in a personally signed letter received just three weeks ago - on April 9 - asking to continue in office. Last summer Stephen Turner, who has bipolar disorder and fronto-temporal dementia, which leads to changes in personality, was found unfit to stand trial but found to have carried out a number of child sex offences. He had performed a sex act on himself in front of children in a theme park three months after police found a cache of child porn on his computer, and was sentenced to a hospital order. Abusers: John Hayford, 84, left, who has dementia and Alzheimer's, was jailed for two years for abusing a girl 20 years ago while John Nolan, was convicted of abusing a little girl but given a suspended sentence because of his dementia . Prosecutions: Gerald Longman, now 81, left, was spared jail despite sexually and physically abusing his daughters and Canadian actor Iain Quarrier was convicted of the attempted abduction of a five-year-old girl in a busy supermarket. He has korsakoff's syndrome, a form of dementia . Last March a former director of the Ulster Museum in Belfast, John Nolan, was convicted of abusing a little girl but given a suspended sentence. His defence QC told the judge that sending his client to prison 'would be a death sentence and Judge Piers Grant agreed that although his offending deserved a prison sentence he would 'exercise considerable mercy'. In February 2014 David Massingham was deemed unfit to stand trial back in February because of his memory loss and confused state. But a jury at Teesside Crown Court still heard his case and convicted him of ten indecent assaults and an offence of a serious sexual assault committed more than 30 years ago. He was also detained in a hospital. In 2012 Gerald Longman, now 81, was spared jail despite sexually and physically abusing his daughters, who waived their anonymity to say they wished he was dead. Longman was given an absolute discharge at Taunton Crown Court as he had been deemed unfit to stand trial due to dementia - but a jury listened to the facts and ruled he had committed the crimes. In 2008 Canadian actor Iain Quarrier was convicted of  the attempted abduction of a five-year-old girl in a busy supermarket. He was given a suspended sentence and banned from unsupervised contact with children after his defence argued he was suffering from korsakoff's syndrome, a form of dementia and was also an alcoholic, but claimed he was not a paedophile.","Eleven politicians from 7 parties made comments in letter to a newspaper .

"A decorated Marine has been considered 'unfit' to re-enlist after getting a rifle tattoo on his forearm to commemorate his previous deployment. Sgt. Daniel Knapp from Jacksonville, North Carolina, received combat medals after serving in Afghanistan, but has been denied re-enlistment due to the service's strict policy on body ink. While the Army has recently updated its policy, the Marine Corps introduced more stringent rules in 2010 concerning the size and placement of tattoos that Knapp has fallen foul of. Despite having several tattoos while he was in the Marines, Sgt. Daniel Knapp  has been denied re-enlistment after getting a tattoo on his forearm – a pair of crossed rifles and 0311 designation for Marine riflemen, right – to commemorate his previous deployment . Despite having several tattoos while he was in the Marines, it is the one he got on his forearm after he left – a pair of crossed rifles and 0311 designation for Marine riflemen – that has cost him his chance at reenlisting. 'When I was in Afghanistan,' Knapp told Marine Corps Times, 'my tattoos never stopped me from shooting anyone, and they never made me more of a target. They never stopped me from keeping Marines safe. On patrol nothing ever happened because of my tattoos.' Knapp is considered a Tier 1 Marine, scoring in the top 10 percent in fitness, marksmanship, and job performance. Despite serving two deployments, earning promotions, a valor award and a waiver endorsed by his command, Knapp has been denied re-enlistment by Marine Corps headquarters. So while members of his unit - Camp Lejeune's 2nd Battalion, 8th Marines – are being deployed to Europe as part of a crisis-response force, he is being left behind. Knapp's predicament highlights a generational disconnect on attitudes towards ink and what marines say is the need for lax regulations that reflect changing societal perceptions of tattoos, writes the Marine Corps Times. Despite serving two deployments, earning promotions, a valor award and a waiver endorsed by his command, Knapp has been denied re-enlistment by Marine Corps headquarters . Otherwise-good marines, such as Knapp, are being lost because of a widespread lack of understanding among the rank-and-file of the organization's lengthy tattoo regulations. Senior officials maintain that tattoos detract from the military bearing and threaten the ability of troops to find work in the civilian sector after their time in the military ends. While the Marine Corps has maintained strict rules, Army officials have become more accepting. U.S. Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno stated earlier this month that while offensive tattoos are still forbidden, other restrictions as to the size, shape and location of the ink have been removed. 'Society is changing its view of tattoos,' Odierno said, 'and we have to change along with that. It makes sense. 'My tattoos never stopped me from shooting anyone': Knapp is now considering joining the Army which has less stringent rules about body ink . 'Soldiers have grown up in an era when tattoos are much more acceptable and we have to change along with that.' Commandant General Joseph Dunford, the sergeant major of the Marine Corps, announced a review if policy earlier this year. On April 16, a spokesman  stated that the review was complete, but the outcome has not yet been announced.","Despite having several tattoos while in the Marines, Sgt.

"A family falsely claimed their three-year-old daughter had a grave heart condition in a bid to collect thousands of dollars in donations on a GoFundMe page, according to police. Joanessa Clawson, 35, her husband James Clawson, 38, and her mother Patti Ann Baldassarre, 68, from Marietta, Georgia, all face felony conspiracy charges. The GoFundMe page, which has now been removed, is written from the point of view of a family friend - who allegedly does not exist - appealing for help for the Clawson family. 'I am posting this for my friend Jo Clawson whose 3-year-old daughter, Sofia, is very ill with a life threatening heart infection,' it reads, according to an image of the page shared by KESQ. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Joanessa Clawson, left, and her husband James Clawson, right, face felony conspiracy charges after they allegedly set up a fake GoFundMe account asking for donations . 'Fake': They pretended to be a friend asking for money for their daughter, claiming that the girl was in hospital with a heart infection after surgery. They asked for $3,000 on the GoFundMe page . 'This happened 2 weeks after Sofia underwent heart surgery to repair a defect that she was born with. This fellow East Cobb family runs their own home-based business.' When shared by KESQ, the page, entitled 'Sofia's Medical and Family Expenses', had raised just $195 but was asking for $3,000. It is not clear how much money the page eventually raised. The couple has two children, the daughter and an older son, according to their Facebook pages. Friends told the channel that they had their suspicions about the fundraiser because their stories did not seem to add up - and the couple has been accused of running scams in the past. In 2006, they were accused by dozens of couples of accepting payments to take wedding photos in Cabazon, California but never delivering the images. Scam: Clawson's mother Patti Ann Baldassarre posed as a nurse to back up the couple's story . Speaking to KESQ, neighbors said they tried to alert police to the fake page months ago. 'There were tons of red flags and there were tons of people in the community who reached out just for the sake of her kids,' Sandra May said. 'And nothing was done.' When they voiced their suspicions, Mrs Clawson allegedly produced a note from a doctor providing the donors a number for a nurse if they had any concerns. But the number on the letter allegedly led to Baldassarre's phone, and the doctor named in the letter had retired years earlier, according to KESQ. After a teacher leaned of the page, she asked Cobb County School Police to check in on the three-year-old daughter and discovered that the child was in fact healthy. The trio was arrested on felony conspiracy charges. Mrs Clawson is also charged with felony theft by deception, while her husband faces an additional charge of misdemeanor obstruction of a law enforcement officer. He posted $5,000 bail but his wife remains behind bars on $10,000 bond and her mother is held on $2,500 bond. In 2006, more than 20 couples said they never received wedding photos despite paying the couple. Arrested: Mrs Clawson, pictured left and right with her older child, was arrested after a teacher asked police to check on the wellbeing of the three-year-old daughter and found she was fine, according to reports . Home: The couple moved to Marietta, Georgia (pictured) after allegedly running a wedding photography business in California - but they allegedly failed to give their clients photos after they were paid . They also accused them of stealing other photographers' work and claiming it was their own in order to promote their business. 'Hired Joanessa Clawson for July 2006 wedding in Los Angeles. Takes great photos but no where to be found once the wedding is over,' one enraged client wrote online in 2006. 'Once they get your check Joanessa and her husband, James, will make every excuse in the book on why you haven't received your photos!! (i.e. Joanessa has health problems from a stroke to the flu to a heart attack, FEDEX is to blame, they have other weddings to tend to etc). 'She may be more affordable than other photographers but in the end, you definitely get what you pay for, nothing.' KESQ reported that some of the clients took the Clawsons to court and won financial judgments.

"A physician, 93, who team doctor for five U.S. men's Olympic hockey squads, including the 'Miracle on Ice' team that won in the 1980's, has suffered serious injuries in an attack while visiting his wife's grave on Sunday. George Nagobads was allegedly mugged by a teenager on Sunday afternoon at the Crystal Lake Cemetery in Minneapolis while laying flowers on his wife Velta's grave. He was released from the hospital on Tuesday with 18 stitches in his head. Scroll down for video . Injured: Dr. George Nagobads, pictured in 2010 with his Hall of Fame plaque, was allegedly attacked on Sunday by a teenager in a cemetary . Visiting his wife: Nagobads was visiting his wife's grave at The Crystal Lake Cemetery when he was allegedly beaten with a snowbrush . After allegedly being attacked by a snowbrush on Sunday, a bloodied Nagobads managed to get back in his car and drive away. Nagobads, who is recovering at home, said on Tuesday that he sped to a nearby hospital following the beating. He told The Star Tribune that he suffered a slight concussion and was kept overnight for observation. Video courtesy Fox 9 . 'I brought new flowers and was just stooping down,' said Nagobads of honoring his wife Velta Nagobads who died in 2005. Nagobads said that by throwing his wallet in attempt to distract the teen he was able to get away without further harm. 'I’m so lucky. … I used that little trick and threw the wallet to get to my car' about 40 yards away, the doctor said. As the boy picked up the wallet, Nagobads continued, 'I was running … really fast. I was surprised how I could run like this.' Victory: He was the doctor fro the 'Miracle on Ice' team that won the improbable gold medal in Lake Placid . Miracle on Ice: Nagobads was team doctor for the famous 'Miracle on Ice' team that won Olympic gold in 1980 and that inspired the 2004 movie 'Miracle' Nagobads said that he bled heavily while behind the wheel of his car and risked being stopped by a cop. 'I drove way over the speed limit. If a cop catches me, that’s fine,' he said he thought after the attack on Sunday. Witness Justin McCarthy says he saw a young man around the age of 14 or 15 looking through a wallet near the mausoleum before fleeing by bicycle and jumping over a fence. 'I saw the kid there. I put two and two together, and I just got really mad,' said McCarthy. McCarthy said he chased the teen but not very far. 'I’m 52 and I’m kind of fat. It wasn’t going to happen. … I was completely exhausted,' said McCarthy. Mccarthy said that Nagobads told him, 'I gave him my wallet, and he still tried to kill me.’ Nagobads was the University of Minnesota men's hockey team physician for 34 years until his retirement in 1992. He also worked for the Minnesota North Stars in the late 1980s and early 1990s. And he was team doctor for the famous 'Miracle on Ice' team that won Olympic gold in 1980.

"Labour leader Ed Miliband has insisted he does not live in a 'mansion' – despite admitting it is worth 'between £2million and £3million'. Mr Miliband said he would have to pay the proposed £250 a month 'mansion tax' on homes worth more than £2million but claimed this did not mean he actually lived in one. The claim comes despite revelations that his four-storey Victorian town house has two kitchens – including one for the family's live-in nanny. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband - with members of staff on the Oncology ward during a visit to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge - has insisted he does not live in a 'mansion' Mr Miliband faced ridicule earlier this month after appearing to play down the size of his north London home. The Labour leader was pictured with his wife Justine in their 'functional kitchenette' instead of the much larger family kitchen downstairs. Mr Miliband, speaking on Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show this afternoon, insisted his home was not a mansion. After confirming that he would be liable to pay the 'mansion tax' he was asked whether he felt like he lived in a mansion. 'No, but look, that's just the term that's used.' Asked how he would pay for the £250 a month levy, Mr Miliband said: 'I'll get it from my income – myself and Justine.' And he declined to set out how much people with homes worth more than £3m would be paying as part of the levy. 'There are about 100,000 homes we think in this area, that will be above £2m and the Treasury has estimated that £1.2bn is a reasonable assumption to make from this. 'We've set out what the band will be between £2m and £3m - £250 a month, which is broadly speaking the top level of the council tax so in other words that's the same again. 'The precise figures above £3m will have to wait for when we get into government, precisely because we've got to establish how many properties are in each band.' Mr Miliband said he would have to pay the proposed £250 a month 'mansion tax' on homes worth more than £2million but claimed this did not mean he actually lived in one . Daniel, Miliband's eldest son, tells the camera the family spartan kitchen is the ‘best’ in the £2.7million home . Kitchen sink dramas: Ed Miliband and his family in the kitchen that has caused so much controversy . According to the property website Zoopla, Mr Miliband owns the most expensive home of any of the political leaders. His home in north London home value at £2.73million, up by more than £1million since 2010. By contrast Mr Cameron's house in West London home would narrowly escape the mansion tax, being valued at £1.971million. Mr Clegg, who lives in Putney in south west London, would also escape with his home valued at £1.89million. Ukip leader Mr Farage is said to have a house in Kent worth a more modest £550,000 – still twice as expensive as the average home in the UK. Under Labour's plan, people trapped in expensive homes who have no access to savings will be protected from the charge aimed at properties worth £2million or more. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has promised to hike the levy for homes with over £10million, to ensure they make a 'significantly bigger contribution'. The £2million limit will rise in line with property prices, instead of inflation 'to ensure that more modest properties are not brought into the scope of the tax'. Labour has joined the Liberal Democrats in promising an extra charge on expensive properties, to target rich homeowners – especially wealthy foreigners who buy up properties in London. There will also be protection for people who do not have large savings or higher earnings, but who live in an expensive home. The Lib Dems used to argue in favour of a 1 per cent charge on the value of any home worth more than £2million, but there are concerns it would be difficult to implement.","Ed Miliband said he would have to pay Labour's proposed 'mansion tax'

"An Indian farmer hanged himself from a tree in the middle of a public protest over land rights after telling onlookers he could no longer afford to feed his three children. With furious demonstrations going on below him in the capital Delhi, Ganjendra Singh, 41, was seen sitting in the tree for some time before throwing a suicide note into the crowd. Seconds later he hanged himself with a white scarf and - despite the best efforts of rally organisers who climbed the tree to untie him - was later declared dead at Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. The demonstrations were organised by members of the Aam Aadmi political party, including Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. They came in for harsh criticism after the protests were allowed to continue, despite Mr Singh's death. Tragic: Ganjendra Singh, 41, hanged himself from a tree in the middle of a public protest over land rights after telling onlookers he could no longer afford to feed his three children . Horror: With furious demonstrations going on below him in the capital Delhi, Ganjendra Singh was seen sitting in the tree for some time before throwing a suicide note into the crowd . Before taking his own life, Mr Singh through a suicide note into the crowd gathered below. 'I am the son of a farmer. He threw me out of home because of damage to the crop. I have three children. I don't have the money to feed my children. Hence, I want to commit suicide,' it read. Police said Mr Singh was originally from Dausa, a town in western Rajasthan state. The Aam Admi Party organized the rally, attended by nearly 1,500 people, opposing changes to the Land Acquisition Act introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. Critics say the changes would make it easier for businesses and the government to buy land and that may disadvantage farmers. However it is believed Mr Singh's crops were devastated by unseasonable rain and hailstorms in March that destroyed large areas of farmland in northern and western India and has led to dozens of debt-ridden farmers killing themselves. Tending the land: Indian farmers and opposition parties have been protesting against a government plan to ease rules for obtaining land for industry and development projects in the country . Working: Farmer Moneswar Kathar walks after irrigating his paddy field at Khetri village earlier this afternoon . Last night heavy rain and hail storm killed at least 32 people, injured more than 100, and caused extensive damage to farms in northeastern parts of Bihar state. Most of the deaths were caused by tin roofs that were blown off of poor people's huts by winds reaching 40 miles per hour. Authorities launched relief efforts in 10 districts hit by the storm. The area is about 225 miles northeast of Patna, the state capital. The storm subsided before daybreak but left extensive damage to the winter wheat crop in its wake. Nitish Kumar, Bihar's top elected official, said the storm also damaged mango and lychee crops. During the protest hours later Mr Singh climbed a tree in the Indian capital Delhi and hanged himself with a rope. In northern Uttar Pradesh state, more than three dozen other farmers also took their own lives, according to the state's government. The largely agrarian state - India's most populous, with 210 million people - declared a state of emergency to seek federal compensation.","Ganjendra Singh, 41, took his own life during a demonstration in Delhi .

"Pitted against a Russian grandmaster in the tournament, 12-year-old chess prodigy Jonah Willow was an underdog even in the eyes of his most ardent supporters. So it came as a surprise when, after two hours of play, Alexander Cherniaev, 45, shrugged resignedly and offered the youngster a draw. ‘The grandmaster felt he could do nothing more to force a win or to break his way through,’ said Jonah’s proud father Simon Scott. Scroll down for video . Talented: Jonah Willow aged 12, who drew a chess match with a Russian grandmaster four times his age . ‘We were all completely amazed. We couldn’t really believe it. You expect grandmasters to destroy people. ‘But Jonah did very well. Cherniaev was left thinking for 15 minutes after one of Jonah’s opening moves while he worked out what to do next.’ Jonah beat three other players in the Nottingham Chess Congress to face Cherniaev, who went on to win the title. Jonah was third overall, qualifying for the British Chess Championships this August in Warwick. It was the fourth time Jonah, from Nottingham, had competed in an open tournament against far older and more experienced players, but the first time he had played a grandmaster. The title, the game’s highest apart from world champion, is conferred by world governing body FIDE. Jonah started playing chess when he was five after seeing his sister Hambel, then eight, playing for fun against their father. Jonah, 12, played chess grandmaster Alexander Cherniaev for hours before the Russian suggested a draw. Proud dad Simon Scott said the chess champion was left thinking for 15 minutes after one of his son's moves . Both children are home-schooled by their parents Mr Scott, 45, a designer, and his partner Carolyne Willow, 49, a children’s rights campaigner and writer. Jonah said of his David versus Goliath encounter on Sunday with Cherniaev: ‘It feels amazing. It was such a shock result. ‘But I wasn't nervous. I knew if I lost that it didn't matter because he is a grandmaster and I was just excited to be playing against him. I’d like to be a grandmaster myself one day.’ Home-schooled Jonah spend up to two hours a day studying chess moves in books and analysing games . Jonah winning chess tournaments at the age of seven, left and eight, right. He has already represented England at junior events .

"It's the most widely used illegal drug in the world, but does cannabis deserve its reputation as being one of the safest? Not if you take a look at South Africa, one of the UK's biggest providers of high-strength cannabis, where a potent strain of the plant dubbed 'swazi gold' is wrecking havoc on its young population. As revealed in BBC's Stacey Dooley Investigates, which aired last night, poverty-stricken grandmothers are growing it, drug mules are risking their lives to smuggle it out of the country, and what stays behind is ruining the lives of South Africa's drug-addled teens. Scroll down for video . Confiscated: Reporter Stacey Dooley (left) poses with blocks of densely-packed cannabis which have been intercepted by officials (centre and right) at South Africa's O R Tambo International Airport . Swazi gold is grown in the tiny South African sovereign state of Swaziland, where the climate and nutrient-rich soil is perfect for growing marijuana. Farmers - many of them 'Grannies' whose children have died and who are now in charge of providing for their grandchildren -  have developed the potent strain through cross-pollination, and can now yield double the crop they once could annually. The result is cannabis which boasts a staggeringly high concentration of THC, the psychoactive agent which produces the high, which finds its way either to the streets of the UK, or the streets of Johannesburg and beyond. 'We don't care where it ends up,' one farmer tells reporter Stacey Dooley. The swazi gold that stays in South Africa is now commonly mixed with heroin to make a highly addictive new cocktail known as nyope. Nyope contains a heroin concentration of around ten per cent, and often 'fillers' including rat poison and crushed HIV tablets. Hooked: South African youths as young as 14 are mixing swazi gold with heroin to form nyope, a highly addictive substance that causes long-term mental problems (file photo) 'I smoke until I die,' one young addict based in Johannesburg's Ivory Park tells Ms Dooley. 'I get crazy if I don't get this.' 'We want to stop but if you are addicted you can't just leave,' complains another. Nyope addicts, many starting out as young as 14, smoke an average of 15 heroin-laced 'joints' per day. They go through stages of painful withdrawal on a daily basis between bouts of being high, with symptoms including restlessness, aching bones and nausea; and most are left with lifelong mental problems as a result of taking the drug. Ms Dooley meets one 18-year-old nyope addict called Tulu who attends a rehab centre every day in a bid to turn his life around. He has been clean for three days when Ms Dooley meets him, and says he's determined to kick the habit. Lucrative: Farmers in Swaziland developed the potent strain through cross-pollination, and can now yield double the crop they once could annually (file photo) Tulu's parents died when he was just 11, leaving him alone to look after his younger sister. 'She's eight, I have to give her something so she can eat at school,' he explains. It's difficult to know where to start when it comes to cracking down on South Africa's drug trade, Ms Dooley concludes. Farmers and dealers simply pay off corrupt members of the police force to avoid being arrested on a daily basis, and the story is much the same in airports. When Ms Dooley visits Johannesburg's O. R. Tambo International Airport, she witnesses one incident of a suitcase packed with cannabis being intercepted, but airport officials admit that more often than not, drugs get through. As for Tulu, when Ms Dooley goes back to his home town to check on him, he has stopped attending rehab. Nyope, it seems, has reclaimed another victim.","The strain is grown in Swaziland, one of South Africa's poorest states .

"A 42-year-old high school teacher in Georgia turned herself in to police on Tuesday to face charges of sleeping with three of her male students. Phoebe Jo Chapman surrendered to sheriffs at the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office in Valdosta and has since been charged with three counts of sexual assault. Police say the charges stem from three separate encounters with different boys. The students have all since graduated, but investigators say there were still attending Lowndes High School when the alleged sexual encounters occurred. Surrendered: Phoebe Jo Chapman, 42, turned herself in to the Lowndes County jail on Tuesday morning and was booked on three counts of sexual assault - one count for each victim . According to WCTV, the sheriff's office received information about Chapman in March. Rumors had been circulating the school that she had had relations with the career and technical instruction teacher and male students. Officers were then able to identify three victims and interviewed them. All three admitted to having sexual relations with Chapman. Chapman resigned from the school as the investigation got underway. 'By statute, any time a teacher is involved in a sexual relationship with a student, it's illegal. They cannot be involved,' Lt. Stryde Jones of the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office told WCTV. Improper relations: Chapman is accused of having sex with three different male students while teaching at Lowndes High School in Valdosta, Georgia . Investigation: Lt. Stryde Jones of the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office said that the other teachers were not aware of what was going on and that rumors started among the students . 'Those teachers are put in a position of trust, just like law enforcement. When you're put in that position of trust, you're held to a higher standard and you're expected to make decisions that are comparable with the position that you're in. Lt. Jones said it appears the relations were kept a secret until the rumors started. 'I don't think other teachers knew,' he told WCTV. 'We have found nothing so far to indicate that anybody at the school in a position of leadership or an employee knew what was going on. 'There may have been other students that knew what was going on but they had not made anything public other than maybe to themselves.'","Phoebe Jo Chapman turned herself in Tuesday in Valdosta, Georgia .

"Samantha Fleming was asleep in the Indiana apartment she shared with her boyfriend and newborn daughter when the doorbell rang on April 6. On the other side, police say, was a professionally dressed woman carrying a binder who introduced herself to Fleming's boyfriend as a Department of Child Services worker on a surprise visit. But authorities say the woman, Geraldine R. Jones, never worked for the child-welfare agency and that her visit to Fleming's apartment in Anderson, about 30 miles north of Indianapolis, was part of an elaborate scheme to take the 17-day-old baby and claim the girl as her own. Why Jones targeted Fleming, and why the young mother and her daughter, Serenity, left the apartment with her, were key questions in a mystery police continued trying to unravel Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Elaborate plot: Geraldine Jones, 36, of Gary, Indiana (left), has been charged with murder, kidnapping and criminal confinement over the death of new mom Samantha Fleming, 23 (right) Kidnapped: Investigators say Jones pretended to be a social worker in order to steal Fleming's daughter, Serenity (pictured), and claim the child as her own after faking a pregnancy . Scene: Fleming's body was found by police at the home belonging to Jones in in Gary, Indiana. The body had been doused with bleach, put in a garbage bag that was duct taped and hidden in a plastic bin inside a closet . Anderson Police Sgt. Chad Boynton said Jones, who was hospitalized for depression and suicidal thoughts, had refused to speak with detectives. Chief Deputy Prosecutor Steve Koester said Jones has waived extradition and is expected to be returned to Madison County by April 30. Family members of Jones and Fleming didn't return calls seeking comment this week. But a probable cause affidavit released Tuesday shed light into the young mother's disappearance and painted a picture of a suspect who claimed she was pregnant, had furnished a home nursery with baby furniture and baby clothes and had either hosted or been the recipient of a baby shower. According to the affidavit, Jones, 36, arrived at the apartment Fleming and her boyfriend, Rainey Stanley, shared and identified herself as a child services worker. She told Fleming she needed her to go to Gary for a hearing and said it would look better if she brought Serenity with her. That was the last time, Stanley told police, that he saw Fleming alive. Police say they believe Jones targeted Fleming but haven't indicated why she would have masqueraded as a child services worker or how she would have been familiar with Fleming's family situation. Killed: Police say Fleming, 23, was lured from her home by Jones and brought Serenity with her . Boynton said Fleming had had previous contact with the Department of Child Services, but details weren't available Tuesday. DCS spokesman James Wide declined to comment, citing privacy laws. Anderson Police Detective Scott Sanderson said that when Fleming didn't return, police began trying to track her cellphone to locate her and the baby. The affidavit said several text messages were sent from Fleming's phone to her mother but that the family didn't believe Fleming sent them because she is a poor speller and the text messages had 'perfect spelling'. Gary police found Fleming's wallet in an apartment complex where Jones' sister lived. Sanderson went to Gary to meet with detectives there on Friday and went to Jones' address, where he found a woman who identified herself as Jones' sister holding a baby. The woman told Sanderson that Jones had dropped the baby off at her father's the previous Friday and that another sister had taken Jones to the airport to go to Texas. Police say Jones told family members she was pregnant with twins and that one had died at birth. Investigation: According to reports, a woman called Fleming's mother before she disappeared saying she was with DCS and wanted information . But her sister told police she didn't think the baby belonged to her sister and that she had taken the infant from her father because he is elderly. She said her sister had attempted to commit suicide the day before. She then mentioned an odor in the house, the affidavit states, and asked Sanderson, ''Do you smell the smell in the house? It smells like someone is dead''. Sanderson said he and a Gary police officer traced the smell to a closet, where they found a plastic bin with what appeared to be a body in a garbage bag tied with duct tape. The body, which had been doused in bleach, was identified as that of Fleming. Police counted at least 10 stab wounds, the affidavit says. Police said they are trying to determine a motive but the evidence 'indicates that Jones intended to raise Serenity as her own child.' Madison County prosecutors filed paperwork in Circuit Court charging Jones with murder, kidnapping and criminal confinement in the death.","Geraldine Jones charged with murder, kidnapping, criminal confinement .

"More than five million Australian visas are expected to be issued to students, tourists and workers this year  - the biggest amount since World War II. As many as 1.9 million foreigners travelling on short term visas are predicted to be spending time Down Under at any one time throughout this year. While a record 185,000 permanent migrants moved to Australia in 1969 - this figure is likely to be exceeded in 2015 as people are moving to the Lucky Country in droves. More than five million visas are expected to be issued to students, tourists and workers this year to come to Australia - the biggest amount since World War II . As many as 1.9 million foreigners travelling on short term visas are predicted to be spending time Down Under at any one time throughout this year . Secretary of the Immigration Department  Michael Pezzullo revealed these figures at a speech at the Australian National University on Tuesday night, Fairfax Media reported. Mr Pezzullo said the challenges were on par to the high numbers in the aftermath of World War II. He said there were more east and southern Asians than Europeans moving to Australia in what has been a quick and significant shift as the number of Chinese-born Australians had tripled in the past 20 years. 'This is equivalent to a migrant-to-population share of almost 28 per cent,' Mr Pezzullo said. 'And the composition of that population is changing in ways that the proponents of 'White Australia' could never have imagined.' While a record 185,000 permanent migrants moved to Australia in 1969 - this figure is likely to be exceeded in 2015 as people are moving to the Lucky Country in droves . Mr Pezzullo pointed out that the nation's 'well-crafted and targeted' immigration program towards skilled migrants was a significant factor to the increase of people uprooting to Australia. 'Migrants enjoy high levels of economic participation as distinct from high levels of social exclusion and welfare-dependency, he said. 'Immigration has beneficial impacts in terms of growth in the demand for goods and services, increases in national income and living standards, improved labour participation, expansion of the economy's productive capacity and growth in household consumption and public revenues,' Mr Pezzullo said.","1.9 million foreigners are likely to be in the country at any one time in 2015 .

"Pilots have reported 167 cases of toxic cabin fumes or smoke in only four months, official safety figures reveal. Twelve of the cases resulted in the pilots requesting a priority landing, one flight was diverted and on two flights the pilots made an emergency Mayday call. Among the worst cases, one incident report in February noted: ‘Fumes in cabin. Eleven of the cabin crew became unwell during flight, with symptoms of light-headedness, nausea and “sea sickness”. Oxygen administered. Aircraft returned.’ Victim? It is suspected British Airways pilot Richard Westgate, who died in 2012, had Aerotoxic Syndrome . The figures have re-opened the argument about whether prolonged exposure to the air in planes is safe for passengers and crew. Details emerged in a report broadcast last night by ITV News, which has seen copies of the Civil Aviation Authority’s safety reports from December 2014 to March 2015. These reveal 167 cases of fumes or smoke in the cabin, not attributable to faulty ovens, coffee brewers or toilets. In February a coroner warned that airlines must take action to prevent passenger deaths from toxic fumes inside aircraft cabins. Dorset coroner Sheriff Payne said pressurised air tainted with jet fuel is risking the lives of everyone travelling on planes. He issued the warning after initial investigations into the death of British Airways pilot Richard Westgate in 2012. The 43-year-old, from Marlborough, Wiltshire, had suffered years of persistent headaches, nausea and chronic fatigue, which he long suspected was caused by toxic fumes in cockpits. Mr Payne’s warning came days after the Daily Mail revealed how the poisoning fears over air in holiday planes had sparked accusations that airlines had been ignoring safety concerns for 15 years. The coroner’s intervention was the first official recognition of Aerotoxic Syndrome, thought to be linked to memory loss, tremors, lethargy, headaches, tinnitus, confusion, breathing difficulties and even death. Safety questions: Pilots have reported 167 cases of toxic cabin fumes or smoke in only four months. The figures have re-opened the argument about whether prolonged exposure to the air in planes is safe . Warning: Dorset coroner Sheriff Payne said pressurised air tainted with jet fuel is risking the lives of those travelling on planes. It followed initial investigations into the death of British Airways pilot Richard Westgate . Many former pilots, co-pilots and aircrew staff believe they have suffered long-term illnesses because of the amount of time they have spent exposed to cabin air and ‘toxic fumes’. The pilots’ union BALPA has raised concerns. Since 1999, the air industry has denied a link between ‘fume events’ and medical problems. But a growing number of experts warn prolonged exposure is hazardous. The problems are thought to arise when cabin air is drawn from the hot engines. Passengers are usually isolated from this ‘bleed air’ – but airlines accept that sometimes there is a leak and jet fuel contaminates the air with compounds called ‘organophosphates’. In small quantities, these compounds may not be harmful – campaigners say it is most likely to create problems for frequent fliers and airline staff. The Civil Aviation Authority said several expert studies on cabin air quality have been carried out in recent years. ‘The overall conclusion has been that there is no positive evidence of a link between exposure to contaminants in cabin air and possible long-term health effects – although such a link cannot be excluded,’ it added. ‘Passenger and crew safety is of paramount importance to the CAA and we are constantly working to enhance safety standards.’","Pilots reported 167 cases of toxic cabin fumes or smoke in four months .

"Volunteers who have restored one of the Dunkirk 'Little Ships' are now hoping they will be able to take the unique vessel back to the beaches where it helped to rescue 600 British soldiers. Fire boat Massey Shaw was requisitioned from the London Fire Brigade in 1940 and transported to Dunkirk to help with the evacuation of Allied troops in the face of the Nazi advance. After carrying 600 soldiers back to Britain, the boat returned to London where it helped to save St Paul's Cathedral and other buildings damaged in the Blitz. Scroll down for video . Renovation: Massey Shaw has been restored to its former glory seven decades after helping to save 600 troops from the Dunkirk beaches . Voyage: Volunteers are now hoping to transport the Massey Shaw back to Dunkirk to celebrate its amazing achievement . Rusting: This shows the poor condition that the Massey Shaw was in before it was restored by a group of volunteers and a trust . Home: The Massey Shaw pictured moored in a dock near Canary Wharf, home to a number of giant global banks . Massey Shaw is still capable of pumping out 3,000 gallons of water every minute - as much as four fire engines - despite being 80 years old. The boat went out of service in 1971, and four decades was used as a walkway in a London dock, allowing people to get to other bessels. But London fireman David Rogers and the Massey Shaw Education Trust spent six years restoring it, thanks to a grant from the National Lottery. They are now seeking additional funding to allow them to transport Massey Shaw to Dunkirk next month, which will mark the 75th anniversary of the Little Ships' adventure. Comeback: It took six years to undo the damage wrought on the Massey Shaw and restore it to how it was in the 1930s . Interior: The engine room of the old fire boat, which is still working well even though it was first built 80 years ago . On board: The controls and fire bell of the Massey Shaw have also been repaired thanks to a National Lottery grant . Deck: The boat is mounted with a hose which can pump out 3,000 gallons of water every minute, the same as four fire engines . Saying goodbye: The Massey Shaw pictured on its final voyage before being decommissioned as a fire boat in 1971 . Mr Rogers said: 'The boat was built in the 1930s and during its career fought fires along the Thames and London before being called to Dunkirk in 1940. It was the only fire boat to go. 'It went with the little ships and was initially going to be used as a fire boat but the strafing and gun fire was too much. 'Because it has a shallow hull it was able to get into La Penne beach outside Dunkirk where she rescued 500 troops in three trips across the English Channel and another 100 back to the UK after that. 'It didn't stop there because as the Massey Shaw headed home a French merchant ship hit a mine about two miles ahead of her. The Massey went to the aid of the aid and the crew and rescued them as well from the water. Controls: Volunteers who restored the boat praised the quality of its 80-year-old engineering which still propels the boat . Journey: A charity needs to raise £10,000 so they can afford the fuel needed to take the Massey Shaw back to Dunkirk this year . Repairs: The engine being removed from the interior of the boat while restoration works were going on . Commemoration: The vessel boasts a plaque marking its historic status as one of the Dunkirk 'Little Ships' 'Of course she was involved in the London Blitz and the Massey Shaw's pumps helped saved St Paul's Cathedral.' The veteran firefighter, who spent 30 years with the London Fire Brigade, paid tribute to Massey Shaw's unique survival. 'There is nothing like it left from the 1930s, she is a beautiful ship and the engineering is something to behold,' he said. The trust is seeking at least £10,000 to pay for the fuel which would be needed to transport the boat from Britain to Dunkirk. After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent to help defend France. But in May 1940, three German Panzer corps attacked France through the Ardennes and quickly advanced to the English Channel. By May 21, the German forces had trapped the BEF and the remains of the French and Belgian armies in an area along the northern coast of France. The British force retreated to Dunkirk as it was the best site for an evacuation and the Battle of Dunkirk raged between May 26 and June 4 1940. However, in one of the most bizarre military manoeuvres of the war, the Nazis halted their final advance - this gave the Allies three days to plan their escape and arrange the evacuation of 330,000 troops. Escape: Soldiers are pictured queuing up waiting to be rescued from Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo . Naval bosses ordered all owners of boats between 30ft and 100ft to offer them up to the Admiralty, as the Navy did not have enough vessels to transport all the troops itself. Many of these Little Ships - which included ferries, paddle steamers and yachts - were taken without their owners' permission because there was no time to contact them. A total of 700 vessels were joined by 200 warships and proceeded to cross the Channel to rescue troops who would otherwise have faced potential disaster at the hands of the Nazis. The mission, codenamed Operation Dynamo, was one of the most extraordinary moments of the war, and allowed the British authorities to rebuild their military strength. Up to 500 Little Ships are believed still to be in existence, and they regularly travel back to Dunkirk in flotilla to recreate the extraordinary operation.","Massey Shaw was requisitioned from the London Fire Brigade and helped rescue 600 troops from Dunkirk in 1940 .

"Marcus Copeland, 44, admitted one count of fraud at Caernarfon Crown Court. He was told he faces jail . A top mortgage broker who bragged that he ‘spared no expense’ to build his dream home is facing jail after conning a bank into giving him the money for it. Marcus Copeland, 44, splashed out almost £1million to complete the six- bedroomed eco house. He sourced specialist Scottish stone and installed the latest environmentally friendly technologies to make the house in Cwm Dyserth, near St Asaph, North Wales, one of the most ‘green’ new builds in the country. But yesterday it emerged that the married father-of-two’s dream had become a nightmare, after he admitted lying on mortgage forms to secure more than £800,000 for the property. At Caernarfon Crown Court the former journalist, who was once named best mortgage broker in the Midlands and Wales, admitted two counts of fraud by lying to Abbey National about the profitability of his business to secure the £847,000 loan in March 2007. At an earlier hearing, he also pleaded guilty to five charges of deception after he used his position to inflate the salaries of five of his clients and help them obtain mortgages totalling £686,000. Jonathan Austin, defending, said Copeland maintained that all the customers knew he had boosted their wages when making the applications. The barrister added that none of the loans had ever been defaulted upon. ‘All these mortgages proved to be affordable,’ the barrister said. ‘The obligations were met.’ Recorder Gregory Bull QC bailed Copeland, of Deganwy, Llandudno, for sentencing later this year. But he went on to warn him: ‘You are not to read anything into the likely sentence. Imprisonment remains an option.’ In November 2010 Copeland’s home was featured in an article for Homebuilding and Renovating magazine and described as the ‘quintessential self-build story – huge ambition matched by a hopelessly stretched budget, spiralling costs and immense stress.’ He and his wife Yvonne, 44, spent a year trying to persuade a farmer to sell them an elevated plot of land in the picturesque village in Denbighshire for £250,000, before spending another £750,000 on the build. Spread out over three storeys, the house features two double garages, a home office, an open-plan kitchen, a dining and sitting area, a TV room terrace and a roof garden, all cut into a hillside overlooking the rolling Welsh countryside. Talking about the project, Copeland told the magazine: ‘If I was to do it again, I’d control my spending. I fell in love with a stone from Scotland that I wanted for the exterior walls. ‘It cost a fortune and I’m not sure you can tell the difference compared with cheaper options. But this was our dream home, so I spared no expense.’ The couple sold the house in September 2012 for £925,000 but, following Copeland’s guilty plea, are now facing having to pay back any profit they have made via the Proceeds of Crime Act. The defendant ran Copeland Mortgage Services in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, and was named Best Mortgage Broker in the Midlands and Wales at the Pink Home Services Awards Night in 2007. Dream home: The award-winning mortgage broker has previously boasted about his £1million hillside home he built in the north Wales countryside (pictured). Now Copeland's double life as a fraudster has emerged . Ambitious: The home was described by one house-building magazine as 'almost the quintessential self build story - huge ambition matched by a hopelessly stretched budget, spiralling costs and immense stress' The home has five floors, a home office, open plan kitchen, a TV room and a roof terrace. It also has panoramic views of sprawling countryside. Copeland had already pleaded guilty to another fraud charge .","Marcus Copeland, 44, won a best mortgage broker award back in 2007 .

"The leader of France's far-right has been named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people alongside President Barack Obama, Pope Francis and Kanye West. National Front leader Marine Le Pen, 46, who took over from her father in 2011, says it shows that her party's brand of political change is getting attention on both sides of the Atlantic. In an interview before a dinner in honour of the Time 100 ion New York on Tuesday, the leader of the staunchly anti-immigration Front spoke of representing a 'great political force'. Anti-immigrant honoured: The leader of right-wing National Front, Marine Le Pen, 46, said being one of the Time 100, shows that her party's brand of political change is getting attention on both sides of the Atlantic . 'People are taking note of the political upheavals that are happening, a great political force that I represent tonight - and that tomorrow can perhaps change the face of decisions that are made not just in France, but perhaps in Europe,' Le Pen said. The recognition comes at an eventful time for Le Pen, who recently announced she would oppose her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, on his candidacy in France's regional elections in December. Earlier this month, Le Pen Snr, who founded National Front in 1972, infuriated his daughter  with a series of racist and anti-Semitic remarks. The 86-year-old  had repeated his claim that the Holocaust was ‘a detail of history’ and had also praised France’s wartime leader Marshal Petain, who collaborated with Hitler. This angered Marine, who said she would not back him in the elections and accused him of ‘political suicide’. Far-right views: Before The Time 100 gala in New York, the leader of the staunchly anti-immigration Front spoke of representing a 'great political force' in Europe . Family feud: Marine, who took over leadership of the party from her father Jean-Marie, 86, in 2011 recently accused him of 'political suicide' after he repeated his claim that the Holocaust was ‘a detail of history’ After this, Jean-Marie Le Pen told French publication Le Figaro that he was withdrawing his candidacy  in the south-east Provence-Alpes-Cote d’Azur region ‘even though I think I am the best candidate’. The former paratrooper said it was because the party was at risk of being ‘dangerously weakened’ over what he called a severe but unjustified crisis over his comments. Mr Le Pen, who remains the Front’s honorary president, said the best replacement candidate would be his grand-daughter Marion Marechal-Le Pen, 25, who confirmed shortly after that she would seek the party’s nomination. Marine Le Pen declined Tuesday to discuss what she thought would be an appropriate punishment but said the party 'can no longer be the hostage of views that are personal views and that certainly contradict the political action of the National Front.' Influential: Rapper Kanye West and his wife, reality TV star Kim Kardashian-West are both on the list .

"Cuts and wounds in the skin heal in much the same way as a zip being fastened, new microscopic images have revealed. Biologists have studied the healing process at a molecular level using electron microscopes to examine skin as it repairs itself. They found skin cells appear to attach to each other using tiny tubes that then pull them together so they interlock like a zip. This image on the left taken of skin cells healing a wound using an electron microscope show how cells on opposing sides (coloured green and brown) interlock together in a similar way to a zipper used on clothes. The image on the right shows how the would looks on the surface at this stage in the healing process . The researchers hope their findings could help in the development of new treatments for wounds that could speed up this process. Dr Mikhail Eltsov, one of the scientists behind the study at Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, said: 'When we look at it from a distance, it appears as if skin cells simply fuse to each other, but if we zoom in, it becomes clear that membranes, molecular machines, and other cellular components are involved. 'Our electron microscope allows us to distinguish the molecular components in the cell that act like small machines to fuse the skin. 'In order to visualize this orchestra of healing, a very high-resolution picture of the process is needed. 'For this purpose we have recorded an enormous amount of data that surpasses all previous studies of this kind.' Dr Eltsov and his colleagues used cells from fruit fly embryos to study the healing processes that take place in skin. The study, which is published in the journal Nature Cell Biology, found that the skin cells on either side of the wound begin by 'sniffing' each other out to find their opposing partners. They then develop adhesive like structure made of microscopic tubes, called microtubules, that pulls them closer together. These attachments work a like velcro and pulls the skin cells towards the opening. Once the cells meet, they use these microtubules as a scaffolding to interlock together like a zip. Professor Achilleas Frangakis, a microscopy expert at Goethe University Frankfurt who led the study, said: 'What was also amazing was the tremendous plasticity of the membranes in this process which managed to close the skin opening in a very short space of time. 'When five to ten cells have found their respective neighbors, the skin already appears normal.' Skin taken from the dead could soon be used to treat wounds in the living. Researchers have found that skin taken from cadavers that is stripped of its cells is effective in healing acute wounds, such as burns, as well as painful ulcers. They believe the new treatment could be used to treat wounds that do not easily heal by themselves, which cost the US alone more than $25 billion (£17 billion) a year. The scientists stripped out the skin’s inner layer – the dermis – which contains blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles and sweat glands, to leave behind its matrix of proteins. The team discovered that ‘decellulised’ skin provides a scaffold that the recipients own cells can populate and can effectively treat acute wounds, such as burns. Clothing zips, like the one above, hold fast by using interlocking segments and this is how skin closes a wound .","Biologists at Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, studied skin healing in fruit fly embryos using an electron microscope to watch what happened .

"Ronan Ghosh, 39, stole £200 worth of meat and wine from a Tesco store in Birmingham, court heard . A millionaire company director was caught on CCTV shoplifting £200 worth of meat and wine from a Tesco supermarket. Ronan Ghosh, 39, was filmed attempting to smuggle the goods out of the store in a bag after paying for other items at the checkout. The company boss heads a global recycling company with a turnover of £16million, lives in a £500,000 home in an exclusive neighbourhood and runs two BMWs. But a court heard that he was caught shoplifting after heading to a Tesco store following an argument with his girlfriend. His own barrister told the judge the offence ‘beggars belief’. Ghosh initially elected trial by jury but he then pleaded guilty to theft. Judge Murray Creed imposed a 12-month community order on Ghosh and told him to complete 80 hours’ unpaid work and pay £575 costs. Birmingham Crown Court heard on Tuesday that Ghosh visited the Tesco store in Stratford Road, south Birmingham, on February 21 and was captured on its security cameras selecting items, including meat and bottles of wine, which he put into a bag. Lal Amarasinghe, prosecuting, said he then went to the checkout and paid for shopping that was in his trolley, but not for what was in the bag. Ghosh was detained by a security guard and police were called. In 2009, the businessman set up RG Recycling – based in Solihull, West Midlands – after more than a decade working in the plant and recycling industry. Charnjit Jutla, defending, told the court the firm supplies ‘high-value machinery for the recycling industry’. He added: ‘It is a global business. It has a yearly turnover of £16million. It beggars belief as to why he finds himself in this court. He accepts full responsibility for what he has done.’ Mr Jutla said Ghosh, who lives in a tree-lined road in Solihull, was ‘disappointed with himself and shocked and embarrassed’. On the day of the theft, his father had told him his mother had been diagnosed with skin cancer and that had ‘worried him a lot’. Mr Jutla said there was also a will being discussed within the family which had put considerable strain on him. Ghosh told police he had visited the Tesco store after having an argument with his girlfriend. He claimed he had not intended to steal the goods. Ghosh, who lives in a luxury £550,000 house in leafy Solihull, initially elected trial by jury at Birmingham Crown Court but then pleaded guilty to theft. He was given a 12-month community order and must pay £575 in costs . One neighbour of Ghosh said yesterday: ‘He has two really nice cars – BMWs. It’s bizarre that he would do something like shoplifting. He seems really nice and pleasant.’ A number of people in the public eye have been accused of shoplifting. In 2012, celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson was cautioned by police after being caught stealing cheese, onions and discounted coleslaw during five shoplifting episodes in 16 days at a Tesco store in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. The father-of-four later said counselling sessions had identified childhood abuse as a possible trigger for the shoplifting spree. Sue Terry, the mother of Chelsea and former England football captain John Terry, was cautioned along with his mother-in-law, Sue Poole, in 2009 after being caught with £800 of food and clothes from Tesco and Marks & Spencer in Weybridge, Surrey. In 1990, TV presenter Richard Madeley was accused of taking wines, spirits and soap powder from a Tesco store in Didsbury, south Manchester. He was cleared the following year.","Ronan Ghosh, 39, was shopping at Tesco store in Birmingham, West Mids .

"An Italian doctor has vowed to confound his medical doubters by proving that he can conduct the world's first head transplant - in less than an hour. Surgeon Sergio Canavero, who has no problem with anyone branding him Dr Frankenstein, also has not got any qualms with wealthy tycoons using the procedure to get a young body in their quest for eternal life. He confirmed that he hopes to operate on his first patient, a Russian with a rare genetic muscle wasting disease, and said he will carry out the procedure in China if he is banned from doing so in the EU or former Soviet Union. Scroll down for video . Controversial Surgeon Sergio Canavero plans to perform the first ever human head transplant, claiming the country which hosts the operation will be a 'world leader' like the US when it put a man on the Moon . Valery Spiridonov wants to be the first person to undergo a head transplant despite the massive risks so he can have a shot at having a healthy body having suffered from Werdnig-Hoffman disease . Dr Canavero says he is ready to be branded a Dr Frankenstein in his attempts to perform the first head transplant. Pictured here is Boris Karolv playing Dr Frankenstein's monster in the 1931 film . Potentially he accepts he could be jailed for conducting such an operation in a country where it does not have approval. 'It's not a problem. If Europe and Russia say ""no"", the surgery will be done in China,' he said. 'I'm ready for that. I've been studying Chinese for a few years. 'You should understand that it's not simply a medical procedure. This surgery has a political meaning. 'The Soviet Union was the first one to send Yuri Gagarin to space, America was the first on the Moon. The country that hosts head transplant surgery for the first time will become a leader like this.' But critics say Dr Canavero's plans are a fantasy. Arthur Caplan, the director of medical ethics at New York University's Langone Medical Centre, has described Dr Canavero as 'nuts'. And Dr Hunt Batjer, president elect of the American Association for Neurological Surgeons, has said: 'I would not wish this on anyone. I would not allow anyone to do it to me as there are a lot of things worse than death.' Nevertheless severely disabled Valery Spiridonov, 30, a sufferer of Werdnig-Hoffman disease, has volunteered to be a guinea pig, knowing the risks. He told MailOnline in an exclusive interview earlier this month: 'My decision is final and I do not plan to change my mind.' 'Am I afraid? Yes, of course I am. But it is not just very scary, but also very interesting. ' This risks appear huge but Dr Canavero insists it would take him less than an hour to put Spiridonov's head on the body of a donor body. 'Valery's head will be cooled to 10-15 degrees Celsius,' the Italian medic said. 'That is done in cases of surgery on deep areas of the brain. 'We will have an hour to 'switch' the head to a different body. You need a few minutes to join blood vessels. 'Valery's head will be detached from his body and transferred to another one in a matter of seconds, and the brain's blood flow will start in about 15 minutes. Dr Canavero giving a presentation on his plans. He claims he has been 'studying Chinese for the past few years' in case he has to perform the operation in China should Europe and Russia say no . 'I will be explaining all the technical peculiarities on June 12 in Annapolis at an international neurosurgeons' conference.' This Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Academy of Neurological and Orthopaedic Surgeons will hear that such surgery is not only possible but imminent, he said. 'I'll prove it is totally possible to all the sceptics there.' He admitted that attaching the head was only the start. 'The surgery will take a lot of time, the joining process may take up to 18-24 hours,' he said. 'Doctors will be taking turns not to get tired.' He added: 'Believe me, I receive a lot of queries from surgeons, volunteers from across the globe who'd like to participate in the surgery. 'If I wanted, I'd be able to have an international team of 150 highly-skilled professionals.' Asked by newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda on the cost of the first surgery, he replied: 'Do you love football? I hate it. Nonetheless, you have slackers who meaninglessly stroll around the pitch and are paid $20-30 million a year. 'I need $15 million. It's the price for happiness and health for a lot of people. But sponsors prefer spending money on healthy boneheads who can't kick a ball.' Asked if such surgery could be used for 'elderly billionaires to get a young body', he claimed he had interest from tycoons seeking to extend their lives. 'You bet - there are a few funds working on prolonging life expectancy, and they are well-funded. 'These people came to me and said, ""here is the money, but we want our participation to stay secret"". 'However, I want everything to be transparent. Doing the surgery in a secret place on a secret island is not my cup of tea, to be honest.' He was ready to be branded Dr Frankenstein. In 1970 Dr Robert White transplanted the head of one monkey onto the body of another, as shown in this diagram. If Mr Spiridonov's head were to be successfully transplanted his jugular vein and spinal cords would have to be similarly fused with those of his new donor body . Dr Canavero has said his new body swap technique could help paralysed people such as Christopher Reeve . 'I am prepared for any nicknames, because it sounds cool and will help to sell more newspapers. 'But I am very conservative when it comes to funding. 'When Bill Gates or Dmitry Itskov (a Russian millionaire supporting the research in artificial intelligence) fund my project, I'll come to the cameras with the receipt and say, ""this person supported my initiative"".' He went on: 'I know what I'm for and am prepared for it. I already have an entire army of enemies. 'But even if I fail with the project, it'll be a lot easier for those who carry on after me.' He admitted that 'the final goal is immortality' and brushed aside objections from churches. 'I'm not a Catholic and not even a Christian. But I respect other points of view. And I will listen to what the Orthodox church has to say. But this church has one point of view, and the Catholic - another.' He claims a senior Catholic figure has said he sees no objections to the surgery, he said, adding: 'In Asia and China, the religious authorities also haven't shown any discontent about that. I don't think the religious aspect will play a huge role. Dr Canavero, who currently undertakes experimental surgery near Turin, said that he had had 'many' offers to be his guinea pig in such surgery. 'My secretary receives queries from all over the world,' he said. 'I won't disclose the names of other candidates because they have not allowed me to do so. 'I chose Valery for two reasons. First, he's brave enough and ready to go till the end. 'Second, his bravery is based on knowledge, he studied everything the scientists have discovered in the area. 'This way, I decided, he will be the first one to make history. 'Other lucky people will get a chance to change their lives after him.' In his remarkable interview with MailOnline, the would-be patient explained that he had agreed to the surgery because 'I don't really have many choices. Dmitry Itskov, a Russian millionaire who supports research in artificial intelligence. Dr Canavero says he'd love to 'come to the cameras' with a receipt to show he had enlisted Mr Itskov's support . 'If I don't try this chance my fate will be very sad. With every year my state is getting worse.' He confirmed: 'I read many scientific articles on this topic. 'The idea to transplant not only organs but the head has been studied for a long time even by Russian specialists. 'But an actual transplantation of the human head was never conducted. 'I contacted Professor Canavero two years ago after reading about his works. I offered myself to him to make this operation possible. 'We have never met, and we just communicate via emails. 'And for the last two years we've been talking this idea through and planning the operation. 'He's a very experienced neurosurgeon and conducted many serious operations. Of course he has never done anything like this and we have to think carefully all the possible risks. 'But in the end it is like with astronauts. Before the first man we sent into space, 300 different scenarios of something going wrong were thought through but when he actually did it, it was the 301st scenario that happened.' He denied his pledge to be a guinea pig is a stunt, and insisted he goes into it with his eyes open. Severely physically handicapped, he made clear: 'I do understand the risks of such surgery. Yhey are multiple. We can't even imagine what exactly can go wrong. 'I'm afraid that I wouldn't live long enough to see it happen to someone else. 'If I want this kind of surgery to happen, I shouldn't put the responsibility onto someone else but should try it on myself. 'My family fully supports me. They also understand all the risks, and even if they think that it's too dangerous, they still support me in my decision.'","Surgeon Sergio Canavero sees 'no problem' with wealthy tycoons using the procedure to get a young body in their quest for eternal life .

"She only gave birth to daughter James three months ago, but Blake Lively is already showcasing her incredible post-baby body in all its glory. The 27-year-old actress, who welcomed her first child with Ryan Reynolds in January, has been out and about promoting her upcoming movie roles (and her new figure). So what's her secret?

Although she has been parading her enviable curves at various events to promote her new movie, Age Of Adaline, in which she stars alongside Michiel Huisman and Harrison Ford, Blake says losing weight hasn't been a priority. Speaking to YOU magazine, Blake said: 'Losing weight is not something I have spent much time focusing on. With a new baby, it’s just about eating well for her, because everything I eat goes right into her system. 'Your body goes through a lot after pregnancy and birth, so small, gentle workouts feel better.' Since welcoming her daughter, she has shunned the gym in favour of al fresco activities. She said: 'I hate the gym. Who doesn’t? When I’m in the gym I feel like I am missing out. I would rather rent a bike or go for a hike.' Blake has been showcasing her trim figure in a variety of outfits, left and centre, at the Good Morning America studios and, right, on SiriusXM later on . Preserve striped wrap dress .

Health, Blake took prenatal yoga classes right up until her due date - and it seems that hard work pays off. Despite her trim figure, the cooking fanatic, who has her own blog, admits that she 'loves' to eat chocolate. A month after having her baby, Blake posted a picture of a hot chocolate with the caption, 'Name one thing better in winter than City Bakery hot chocolate…that’s what I thought.' Although she has been parading her enviable curves at various events to promote her new movie, Blake, pictured arriving at Sirius radio in New York on Tuesday, says losing weight hasn't been a priority . In past interviews, Blake has explained that she prefers to fill her diet with fresh produce, blended juices and lean proteins. A source revealed that she had been eating plenty of lean proteins like turkey, chicken and venison to shed the baby weight. Despite her envy-inducing figure, Blake admitted that she has insecure days just like everyone else. She admitted: 'Some days I look in the mirror and think, ""Oh my gosh. I look like a potato."" You think that I would never feel bad about myself? I’m a human being - everybody has their insecurities. 'Ask Gisele [Bündchen] or Beyoncé. They will tell you that some days, they don’t feel good about themselves.' Style chameleon: Her fifth look of the day was a pastel pink coat with matching high-waisted trousers and a tight mesh top, paired with some simple earrings by Lorraine Schwartz . Blake has been showcasing her new figure in a variety of on-trend outfits at various events and personal appearances to promote her acting roles. During one interview, she finally revealed why she gave her daughter the moniker James -  a name traditionally given to a boy. She told the host: 'It's a family name, and I liked having a boy's name.' Blake also revealed  that if she had one piece of advice for her beloved daughter, it would be, 'don't let anyone tell you no.' The 27-year-old actress also jokingly shared with host Jimmy Fallon that her 38-year-old spouse is 'pathetic' at parenting even revealing: 'I do everything, he does nothing!' At the Reynolds' household, the first-time parents currently have a bit of a competition regarding their only child. 'We're total rivals,' she shared explaining that she and Ryan are trying hard to teach little James to say her first word of 'dada' or 'mama.' 'Dada is banned in our house!' Blake admitted.

"Sally Lutkin, 49, had to undergo emergency surgery and was in hospital for a week after a botched tattoo . When Sally Lutkin decided to have her grandchildren's names tattooed on her leg, she imagined ending up with a beautiful, life-long reminder of her loved ones. Instead, she was left with a gruesome black hole and a lasting scar in the middle of her calf, after being rushed to hospital for emergency surgery. Mrs Lutkin, 49, had a rose surrounded by the names grandchildren Harvey, seven, Harvey Junior, six, and Cooper, one, tattooed above her left ankle in November 2013. But the tattoo quickly became so swollen that she was in agony and couldn't walk, forcing her to rush to A&E. Doctors carried out emergency surgery to stop the infection spreading to her bone. She was left with a bloody hole resembling a gunshot in the middle of her rose design, as well as an unsightly scar she will have to live with for years. Mrs Lutkin, of Kingston upon Hull, East Yorkshire, said: 'It really upset me because it's something that I wanted just for me - and it really didn't turn out that way. 'I was in the hospital for a week and it was so difficult because it's the longest I've ever been away from my babies. 'They had to operate before the infection spread down to the bone and I don't know what would have happened if they had not caught it earlier. 'The pain was horrendous - it was indescribable. I was in agony and the swelling was so bad that I couldn't walk.' Her daughter Laura, 28, noticed that the tattoo was turning red the day after the needle work was complete. But Mrs Lutkin, who works as a cleaner, dismissed it as a normal part of the healing process. She was horrified when the symptoms worsened and her leg began to swell until she could no longer walk. Her  husband Peter, 57, a labourer, rushed her to hospital and she remained there for a week while she battled the nightmare infection. Mrs Lutkin, who has five children, admitted that even 18 months later she is still feeling the effects of the infection. Mrs Lutkin wanted a tattoo of a rose and her grandchildren's names (Harvey, seven, is pictured, left). But it became infected and after an emergency operation she was left with a gruesome hole in her leg (right) She has been left with a scar even 18 months after the ordeal, and has vowed never to have another tattoo again in her life . She said: 'I still get aches and pains from it but I just have to get on with my life. 'We're a really close family and they were shocked. 'It was a hard thing for them to see me in so much pain, especially for my eldest grandkids. 'It ruined Christmas because I couldn't go out Christmas shopping and all the little ones wanted to put the decorations up - in the end, my kids had to put them up for me.' The ordeal forced her to abandon plans to add the names of one-year-olds Lottie and Harper - who were born within six days of one another - to the body art. And, with another grandchild on the way, Mrs Lutkin insists she is not tempted to tamper with ink any more. She said: 'It's put me off for life. I'd had tattoos before but I'll never have one again. 'I won't even risk getting the tattoo removed. 'No one is laying their hands on me ever again after this.' Her leg became red and swollen - so much so that she was in agony and couldn't walk (pictured). She said: 'No one is laying their hands on me ever again after this.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"As the election race hots up, Labour leader Ed Miliband is getting a small taste of what it might be like to be a member of One Direction. A group of female fans, who've dubbed themselves the 'Milifans', are rallying support for the opposition leader on social media using the Twitter hashtag #milifandom. The largely teenage fanbase have spent the days running up to the May 7th election posting tweets of affection for the politician. Led by Twitter user @twcuddleston, an AS Levels student by the name of Abby, the unlikely fan club has prompted hundreds of tweets from fellow users who share their admiration for the Labour leader. My heart belongs to Ed! The Labour leader (pictured in Manchester yesterday) has been the subject of a social media storm in recent days as a group of fans, mainly teenagers, have posted their affection for him under the #milifandom hashtag . Behind the #Milifandom hashtag is @twcuddleston, an AS Level student who appears to be a genuine Labour supporter. Her tweets in support of Ed have led to lots of other women posting tweets of affection for him . Fearing a gaffe, the Labour leader has remained tight-lipped on what he makes of the Milifans but did tweet back the teen behind it, @twcuddleston . In her Twitter profile, she describes herself as 'leader of the Milifandom, a movement against the distorted media portrayal of Ed.' And even she is amazed at just how the hashtag has taken off, saying 'There are those in the milifandom, those who find the milifandom funny, and those who wonder how the hell Ed Miliband has a fandom.' Perhaps fearing a gaffe, the Labour leader has remained tight-lipped on what he makes of the Milifans but did tweet the teen behind it, @twcuddleston, saying 'Hi Abby - Delighted that you've joined Labour - welcome.' While Abby seems to be a genuine Labour supporter and a level-headed teen - she's declined giving interviews in favour of revising for her upcoming exams, others seem to be more preoccupied with Miliband's physical appearance than his abilities to run the country. One user @Helen121 defended criticism of Miliband, saying he's 'not ""mouldy"", he's hot!' Another, @helenamelia_xox, said 'If I ever met ed miliband I actually would cry he's so hot.' Admirer, Ellie, also chimed in: 'This all started out as a joke but now I think I legitimately fancy Ed Miliband.' One user @Helen121 defended criticism of Miliband, saying he's 'not ""mouldy"", he's hot!' Another, @helenamelia_xox, said 'If I ever met ed miliband I actually would cry he's so hot' Maybe one day: Labour fan @Sophiephilips1 dreams that Ed will visit her in the South West . Teen angst: @theurbanangel described her crush on Ed Miliband as 'painful' Internet jokers have also got in on the act, posting mocked-up images of Miliband as various heartthrobs. @GeneralBoles seems particularly adept at it and has morphed the opposition leader's face onto a series of scenes from Poldark, Sherlock and Fifty Shades of Grey amongst others. @GeneralBoles admitted to FEMAIL that he felt a little guilty about his Photoshopping satire, saying: 'I'm actually feeling quite guilty about jumping on the #milifandom thing. 'I've been doing satirical political Photoshops for a couple of years now and had a load of Miliband ones already on file.' Unlikely heartthrob: Images of the opposition leader looking sultry for a newspaper article have been shared by Twitter users . In an attempt to make the Labour leader look cool, Twitter users have begun editing his face on to the body of famous men, including Daniel Craig as James Bond in movie Casino Royale . Ed Milibond: Dressed in a suave grey suit,  the Labour leader is superimposed on yet another photograph of secret agent, James Bond . Windswept: While TV viewers swooned over Aidan Turner's Poldark, Ed Miliband has consistently polled low in popularity ratings . Not buying it: The drastic reworking of Miliband comes after he gained a reputation for appearing in awkward pictures, including eating a bacon sandwich (pictured here on the body of Don Draper, from Mad Men) He continues: 'This morning I saw a tweet by the young woman who I think originated #milifandom and it seems she was doing it because she supports Labour and doesn't like the way Ed is portrayed.' The Twitter mischief-maker, who declined to reveal his real identity, said he'd had over 1000 retweets of his images yesterday. While Miliband may be revelling in a very different type of attention to what he's used to, he's keeping schtum on the subject so far although he has tweeted @twcuddleston to thank her for her support of the Labour Party. Fellow Labour Party members have noticed the hysteria though, with Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan tweeting 'And I thought I was an @Ed_Miliband fan… #milifandom.' Such adoration is a feeling that Miliband may not have expected but now might be getting used to. Ed Miliband was mobbed by a screaming hen party – and even let the bride on his tour bus for a private 'selfie' The bride-to-be's sister, Kathryn Braithwaite, posted a picture of Nicola and Miliband on the campaign bus . Just last week, the Labour leader was mobbed by a screaming hen party - and even let the bride on his tour bus for a 'selfie'. Miliband was jokingly referred to as the stripper after his battle bus was gatecrashed by bride-to-be Nicola Braithwaite and her friends. One of the group from Knutsford spotted the leader's bus when she popped outside the Westminster Hotel for a cigarette and quickly alerted the bride. After brief negotiations with his spin doctors, the solicitor was allowed on the bus and emerged grinning after a few minutes in a white and blue dress, saying: 'I got a full on picture with him'. She was met by whoops and cheers from the raucous group of hens, all wearing black dresses and pink sashes, who started yelling for him to come and meet them. The Labour leader then appeared and high-fived a few of the women before they started chanting 'Selfie! Selfie! Selfie!' and turned their backs on him for a group shot. One of the women was heard saying: 'Hashtag Ed' and the group erupted into giggles before Mr Miliband made his excuses and waved goodbye.

I would never have believed that a strapless dress might make me look smaller than I am. This one manages the impossible. The narrow skirt clings to my hips and legs, making me look taller and slimmer, and the bustline is quite high, hiding the cleavage which gives a nice demure look. What I really like is the scalloped edge of the dress against the bust and at the hem, which softens the silhouette. But while looking summery, the lace fabric actually gives quite a lot of secret support, boosted by the Chantelle strapless bra I wear underneath all the dresses. Great for summer weddings. 4/5 . ONE FOR TEENS . Prom-style dress, £58.99, Chichiclothing.com . Gold sandals, £34,99, newlook.com . This might look lovely on a teenage girl, but on me — eek! At 48 I’m at least 30 years too old to carry it off. The material is flimsy and there’s almost no structure, so my bust looks horribly saggy. And the full skirt makes me look as large around the bottom as I am on top — not a good look. Forget dream prom dress — this is a nightmare. 1/5 . FLATTERING AND COMFY . Floral maxi dress, £72, Asos.com . The large, floral pattern that adorns this floaty maxi dress is the key to its flattering effect. It distracts the eye which instantly slims you. This is a relaxed, 1970s style, so anything too fitted would look out of place. The best thing is how comfortable it feels. You could wear it anywhere — to the beach, to a garden party, or to an evening do. A winner, and at a great price, too. 5/5 . SHORT... BUT NOT SWEET . Mini dress, £45, Riverisland.com; Strap-heeled sandals, £39.99, Zara.com . This clings well and gives me a neat waistline. The bandeau-style top is supportive of my bust while slimming it down. But below the waist it’s a different story. Quite frankly, the skirt is far too short. I’ve always believed you have to choose between showing off your boobs or your legs: doing both veers far too close to tarty for my liking. I’d have given this dress full marks if it had been ten inches longer. 2/5 . OSCAR WORTHY . Double layer maxi dress, £110, Jarlolondon.co.uk . This clever design has a double layer: the lining clings tightly, but the top layer skims over the chest for a classier silhouette. The overall look is statuesque and Grecian. The vibrant orange shade makes it the perfect choice for a summer party — it would look fab with a tan. In it, I feel like Cameron Diaz going up for an Oscar. I’m ready for my close-up. 5/5 . I LOOK SO SLIM . Sweetheart neckline dress, £150, Coast-stores.com; Heels. £485, biondacastana.com . This sophisticated little summery frock has a sweetheart neckline, which curves down to show a bit of cleavage and then rises up to cover the breasts on either side, striking the perfect balance between flirtiness and discretion. As well as being flattering, the bodice is structured and well-made, minimising my bust and giving plenty of support where it’s needed — there’s no way I’ll be falling out of this frock. The clingy pencil skirt has the same miraculous effect, slimming down my bottom and hips, and falling flatteringly below the knee. I can certainly imagine myself going to a summer wedding in this little green number. 4/5 .","Flashing tanned shoulders and pretty decolletage is a red carpet staple .

"The diversity of life on Earth is increasing despite dire warnings that the planet is facing a mass extinction, a leading writer has claimed. Stewart Brand, president of the Long Now Foundation and editor of the Whole Earth Catalogue, believes the focus on widespread extinctions may actually be harmful. Instead he argues it is highly unlikely that the planet is facing a sixth mass extinction as many threatened species are recovering. This chart shows the increase in marine biodiversity from the fossil record and the five mass extinction events . His views are likely to be controversial with conservationists who have been warning that human activities risk killing off a large proportion of species on Earth in an event to rival the extinction of the dinosaurs. Mr Brand, who campaigns for long term solutions to the world's problems rather than short term policy decisions, said that the rate of discovery of new species was currently outstripping the loss of species to extinction. 1. Indonesia - 184 . 2. Madagascar - 114 . 3. Mexico - 101 . 4. India - 94 . 5. Brazil - 82 . 6. China - 73 . 7. Malaysia - 70 . 8. Thailand - 55 . 9. Australia - 55 . 10. Peru - 54 . Writing for Aeon, he said: 'Viewing every conservation issue through the lens of extinction threat is simplistic and usually irrelevant. 'Worse, it introduces an emotional charge that makes the problem seem cosmic and overwhelming rather than local and solvable.' Instead he argues that the trends for conservation are actually 'looking bright' as depleted ecosystems are being enriched and damage in others is slowing. He said: 'The five historic mass extinctions eliminated 70 per cent or more of all species in a relatively short time. That is not going on now.' Mr Brand points to recent research by the ecologist Mark Costello at the University of Auckland who found that the number of new species being recorded was now at around 18,000 a year. They said that the current extinction rate of one per cent of species per decade was far lower than the discovery rate of three per cent per decade. Fossil records also indicate that biodiversity in the world has been increasing for the past 200 million years and is now at its highest level ever. The black rhino, pictured, was considered to be one of the most endangered species in the world and intensive efforts have been made to help conserve the species and its numbers are slowly beginning to rise again . Major efforts to remove rats from Codfish Island in New Zealand has allowed the kakapo (above) to recover . Mr Brand also points to the efforts that have taken place on many islands around the world - where species are most vulnerable to extinction. He said that schemes to eradicate invasive species like rats and goats had been hugely successful and allowed many island species to bounce back. He also pointed to the example of cod, which the ICUN Red List describes as being threatened with extinction, but many cod fisheries are now recovering. Mr Brand, who is also a campaigner to reintroduce extinct species such as woolly mammoths and passenger pigeons, believes biotechnology could also help to bring other species back from the brink by allowing their genetic diversity to be improved. Sumatran orangutans (pictured) have a population of just a few thousand as their forests have been destroyed . He said that some wild animals are moving back into areas where they have long been absent by themselves. Salmon for example have moved back into the Rhine, Seine and the Thames as the water has becoe cleaner. Wolves, lynx and brown bears are also spreading in many parts of Europe. He said that even with climate change, it is unlikely that all of the 23,214 species currently deemed as threatened with extinction would die out. Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago . This was the third largest extinction in Earth's history, and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82-88 per cent of all species. Late Devonian mass extinction - 375-359 million years ago . Three quarters of all species on Earth died out in the Late Devonian mass extinction, though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years. Around 22 per cent of all marine families, and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79-87 per cent of all species. Permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago . The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago . There were two or three phases of extinction that made up the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event. 22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76-84 per cent of all species. Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago . The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71-81 per cent of all species. The map above shows the countries with the highest number of threatened mammals in the world . There are more than 1.5 million known species in the world. Mr Brand said he did not believe climate change is likely to have much impact on the loss of wildlife as many species will evolve and adapt to cope. He said: 'My own prediction is that climate change will be deemed intolerable for humans long before it speeds up extinction rates, and even if radical steps have to be taken to head it off, they will be taken.'","Writer Stewart Brand says warnings that the world is facing a new mass extinction may lead to a fatalistic attitude that will do more harm than good .

"He made the headlines for his plan to travel 20,000 miles on 21 flights in first class... without paying a penny. Now American 28-year-old Scott Keyes has revealed his savvy secrets so you too can explore the world without falling into the ticket traps. The Think Progress reporter reveals his travel hacks in his eBooks How To Fly For Free and How To Find Cheap Flights, and spoke to MailOnline Travel about his top tips. Scroll down for video . Scott Keyes (above), a 28-year-old writer for Think Progress, is about to travel 20,000miles on 21 flights . Globe-trotter: Along the way he will be stopping by 13 countries in Europe and South and North America . Stock up flyer miles through credit cards . Keyes recommends credit cards are the best way to go if you want to quickly and easily rack up frequent flyer miles, which you can then use to take free flights. He only sign up for cards with high sign-up bonuses and relatively low spending thresholds necessary to get those. For example, a card he just got gave 50,000 bonus points for spending $1,000 in three months. The writer makes a point of putting all everyday spending on credit cards in order to hit these spending thresholds. (Unfortunately, this is mostly true for American travellers; European credit cards and elsewhere tend to offer fairly meagre perks.) As long as you can handle credit responsibly and treat your credit card like a debit card, you can work towards a surprising amount of free travel. My favourite credit card is almost always whichever one offers the best sign-up bonus at the time. So right now, the best three are American Airlines' Citi Platinum card, the United MileagePlus Explorer card, and British Airways Visa Signature card, each of which offers a sign-up bonus of 50,000 miles. (For complicated reasons, I probably like the BA card the best, because if you're flying less than 650 miles, 50,000 miles will get you as many as 11 free flights.) I basically ignore the 'get one mile for every dollar you spend' incentive, since I don't have much money to spend. In order to get as many miles as the sign-up bonus, I would have to spend $50,000! I focus almost exclusively on the sign-up bonus when deciding what card to get next. Keyes uses a number of techniques to travel first class around the world for free, which he has revealed in his two eBooks. Here pictured in Mexico . Fly on the cheapest days of the week . Be flexible with your dates when you want to take a trip of a set number of days. Often times a Friday-Monday flight will be cheaper than a Thursday-Sunday, for instance, even though it's the same number of days. Usually the cheapest days to fly are Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday. Keyes poses while rafting down Sumidero Canyon which is located near the city of Chiapa de Corzo in Mexico . Check the day before and after for cheaper fares . Always search one day before or after just out of curiosity, because sometime red-eye flights can technically leave on the next day. These flights leave late at night, arriving in early morning and inside the US these flights are almost exclusively for travel from the West to the East. 'I once helped my friend George cut the price of a round trip flight to Vegas nearly in half by finding a redeye flight that left just after midnight, making it technically a Monday flight and not a Sunday flight,' Keyes tells MailOnline Travel. Wading into the waters of Hierve el agua in Oaxaca, Mexico, rock formations and the remnants of old geysers . Work backwards with your trip . If you want the cheapest flights, chase the fare, not the destination. In other words, rather than picking a destination and then looking for the cheapest way to get there, start out by looking where there are cheap flights, and then decide among those where you'd like to go. Keyes explains: 'I never had my heart set on going to Milan, but when a $65 flight from NYC-Milan popped up, I jumped on it. 'That's too great a deal to pass up, after all.' The 28-year-old having fun wearing a tortoise shell in the Galapagos Islands on holiday . Search for the whole month for flights . Refer to websites such as Kayak and ITA Matrix which give you an month's overview of flights a prices. Make your itinerary as flexible as possible so you are able to opt for going a few weeks after you intended to get the lower fares. Enjoying the view! The writer recommends flying on a Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday as these are usually cheaper . Try flying to gateway airports . If you're flying to a different continent and want the cheapest price, you should search for a number of different gateway airports in that region. For example, if you want to fly to Bali, start by searching for flights to Bali, but don't stop there. Also look at the cost of flights to Jakarta, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur. If any of those flights is significantly cheaper, you can usually find a cheap budget flight from there to continue on to Bali. Searching leg-by-leg like this can save hundreds on your overall flight cost because flight search engines usually can't combine a long haul flight on one airline with a short flight on a separate budget airline.

Helsinki - Berlin, Germany, 697 miles . Berlin - Chicago, 4412 miles . Chicago - Dayton, 240 miles . Total: 20205 miles . Don't book in advance . Don't buy domestic flights more than one-three months in advance. Fares rarely go on sale further than three months in advance, so you'll miss out on some upcoming deals if you book too early. On the other side, don't wait until the last minute to book. Unlike 20 years ago, standby fares are mostly a thing of the past and fares tend to shoot up in the final days before a flight actually takes place. For popular flight times during the holiday season or for long haul, look six months in advance. Being bumped is not the end of the world . Being delayed or bumped from a flight is a situation many travellers fear. However it could prove to be in your favour with some airports if you ask for money or frequent flyer miles instead of flight vouchers. 'I was once given a $500 voucher and a confirmed seat on the next flight — an hour and a half later,' Keyes wrote in How To Fly For Free. 'In other words, I earned $333/hour. 'Like me, if your goal is to fly for free, you probably don’t make $333/hour. 'Plus, unlike flights you book using miles, you actually earn miles when you pay using a voucher.' Keyes is seen posing in front of the famed Materhorn on a previous trip, which straddles the border of Switzerland and Italy . Take advantage of tweet deck and email alerts . Don't make flight hunting something you only do when looking to plan your trip. Constantly be updated with alerts and tweets promoting the cheapest tickets. Keyes recommends the best newsletter alerts are from Airfarewatchdog and The Flight Deal. You can also sign up to receive emails from the savvy traveller himself for deals he comes across. The writer recommends being open to stop off at a gateway airport in a cheaper destination, before continuing with the second leg of your journey to where you want to go .","Scott Keyes, 28, has cracked the system around the world for free .

"Shirley Temple's bitter ex-husband tried to derail her appointment to a diplomatic post by calling her 'emotionally unstable' during her FBI background check . John George Agar told an agent in 1969 to think twice because Temple would 'overreact if she didn't get her way'. He also said that her mother had wrecked their marriage because she interfered in their affairs too much. His efforts were unsuccessful as dozens of other people including Ronald Reagan came to Temple's defense and called her a 'very courageous woman of the highest morals'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Child star: Shirley Temple made her name as the child actor who cheered America through the Depression but in later years she was a committed Republican who wanted to serve her country . Public roles: She was initially used to fame as the star of Bright Eyes, Curly Top and Heidi, but Shirley Temple turned to public service and was US ambassador to Ghana in 1974-1976 and Czechoslovakia 1989-1992 . Bitter ex: John Agar, who was Shirley Temple's first husband, was determined to bad mouth her as the FBI launched a detailed background check when she was nominated for office by Richard Nixon. The couple married when she was 17 and were photographed (above) two years later . The claims were revealed in FBI files obtained by Daily Mail Online through Freedom of Information requests. Temple was a child star whose career began at three; she became the biggest actress in America in the 1930s and raked in an unheard of $50,000 a film after the success of movies like Bright Eyes and Curly Top. Her career ran until she was 22 at which point she began doing charity work and became well known for her Republican views, running unsuccessfully for a House seat in California in 1967. In 1969 President Nixon wanted to appoint her to the post of US representative to the UN so the FBI carried out a full background check, which included everything from her credit history to interviews with former teachers. Among those the agents spoke to was Agar, Temple's first husband who she married at 17 and divorced in 1950 at the age of 22 after they had a daughter together. Her divorce petition said that Temple had endured 'grievous mental suffering' and that Agar had subjected her to 'extreme cruelty'. When the FBI agent came to speak with Agar, the file states he told them that he had not been in contact with his ex-wife at all since they split up two decades before. The report states: 'He further stated that during his marriage her mother interfered with their affairs, which caused part of their marital problems. 'He advised he would hesitate to recommend [her] for a position of trust and confidence in the Federal government as, during their marriage, he considered her emotionally unstable in that she had a tendency to 'overreact' if she did not get her way'. Agar did however say there was 'no question' over her integrity or her associates. President Reagan, who was governor of California at the time, gave a statement through his assistant that Temple was a friend of his for 25 years and that she had served on the state Advisory Hospital Council. Political: Richard Nixon had known Shirley Temple long before he was president. They are seen in 1960 at a benefit for the Multiple Sclerosis Society. Nixon was running for president and Temple a staunch Republican . Loyal: Shirley Temple with her second husband Charles Black. FBI background reports said that they had a strong marriage and that she was a committed patriot . Rescuer: Ronald Reagan had appeared alongside Shirley Temple in That Hagen Girl in 1947. He was California's governor when he and others endorsed her for office during FBI background checks, unlike her ex-husband . He said that he had the 'utmost trust and confidence' in her abilities and that he considers her 'loyalty, morals, character, reputation and associates to be beyond reproach'. The report said: 'He said he had never heard anything derogatory about (Temple) and he highly recommended her for a position of trust and responsibility in the United States government'. The picture from other people who were interviewed by the FBI was generally positive, with a few reservations. Sheriff Earl Whitmore of Redwood City in California, where Temple was living at the time, said that her 'loyalty to this country is completely unquestioned'. However Lucille Hosmer, who got to know Temple when she was running for Congress, said that she was 'somewhat naive in her acceptance of people and organisations'. She also claimed that Temple was 'aloof' and that she had been accused of 'snobbery' because she doesn't have a good memory for names and faces. Hosmer also claimed that Temple was 'not a deep thinker' and needs a good team around her to function well. Another female Republican advisor who was spoken to says that Temple 'cannot stand the flak of controversy' whilst a second said that she is 'easily directed'. A former district office manager for California Representative Paul McCloskey, whose name has been redacted, says that he had a 'personal like for [her] and felt she was completely sincere in what she does'. Friends: Shirley Temple was a friend of Richard Nixon, who nominated her for the American ambassadorship to the UN, and of J Edgar Hoover, whose agency was asked to investigated her background . Family life: Shirley Temple became a full-time mother to her children (from left) Susan Agar, whose father was her first husband, and Charles Jr and Lori, by her second husband Charles Black (right) Devoted: Shirley Temple and her second husband Charles Black. The files praised their family life and said the manager of their country club 'considers the Blacks to be one of the finest families she has ever known' there. But he also felt that Temple 'did not have the intellectual background for the job she was seeking'. The FBI file is very much a product of its time and calls Temple an 'unemployed housewife except when she worked as an actress'. An account of an interview with the manager of the Menlo Country Club, whose name has been redacted, suggesting she is still alive, said: 'She stated she considers the Blacks to be one of the finest families that she has ever known at the club and described the Black children as very fine, strictly raised children.' A summary document of interviews prepared by FBI agent Donald Kuno reveals that some of those spoken to thought she was 'not outstanding in administrative matters'. The file claims that Temple and FBI director J Edgar Hoover were friends and says that agents were not to conduct neighborhood surveillance on her 'unless the need arises', and only with approval of their superiors at the bureau. Temple was appointed to the post but only held it from September until December 1969. By 1974 Temple was being lined up for the post of US ambassador to Ghana after Secretary of State Henry Kissinger heard her discussing Namibia at a party and was 'surprised that I even knew the word', Temple said in one interview. The FBI carried out more checks on her past and approached future President George H.W. Bush, who was chairman of the Republican National Committee at the time, to give his view of her. The response was that Bush had known Temple through her work at the UN and that he 'knows of no information which could conceivably contract from her good character, associates, reputation, and loyalty'. She got the post, which she held for two years, and was then Gerald Ford's chief of protocol, from July 1976 until January 1977. Temple would later serve as US ambassador to Czechoslovakia from 1989 to 1992, a role that President Bush awarded to her whilst he was in office. She died last year aged 85 having been married to her second husband Charles Black until his death in 2005. President Bush said at the time that he and his wife were mourning the loss of an 'American icon'. READ THE DOCUMENTS IN FULL BELOW .

"A swimming pool on the banks of the Thames is one step closer to becoming a reality following lobbying by celebrity backers - with David Walliams saying he will be the first to take a dip. In two years the Thames Bath Lido, which will sit near Blackfriars Bridge, should open with the backing of a recently launched crowdfunding project. The plans have moved far quicker than an initial ten-year initiative to clean up the Thames for swimmers with the aid of celebrities such as artist Tracy Emin and David Walliams. In two years the Thames Bath Lido, which will sit near Blackfriars Bridge, should open with the backing of a recently launched crowdfunding project . Floated in 2013 the original idea was conceived by three Londoners who dreamt of bringing the beautiful lakes of Zurich to the capital . James Lowe (left), Chris Romer-Lee (centre) and Matt Bamford-Bowes (right) originally thought up the Thames Lido . Walliams has said if the water is clean enough he will be the first to jump in. The Little Britain star has been a vocal champion of open-water swimming since he crossed the English Channel unaided for charity in 2006. He also did a 140-mile charity swim of the Thames in 2011. Tracy Emin said she couldn't believe how underused the Thames is adding 'If you could swim in the Thames, it'd be incredible' Professional bodies such as the Royal Academy of Arts, New London Architecture and many others have also pledged their support for the scheme. The plan is to incorporate two pools, a 25 meter lap pool and a training pool. The baths will also be heated to make them available for use all year around. Founder of the Kickstarter campaign to launch the lido, Chris Romer-Lee said  'Ever since we first sketched out the original concept for Thames Baths, we have always wanted to build something that benefited the community and allowed them to participate in its creation. 'The latter is one of the reasons why we are launching crowdfunding on Kickstarter. We want Londoners, swimmers and anyone passionate about urban waterways to show their support for this project and what better way than a very public campaign.' David Walliams, here pictured swimming the Thames in 2011, has said he will be the first to jump in the new pool . The plan is to incorporate two pools, a 25 meter lap pool and a training pool. The baths will also be heated to make them available for use all year around . The two year plan will include a sophisticated filtration system that would turn the fuel drenched Thames into crystal clear water for anyone swimming in the lido . Floated in 2013 the original idea was conceived by three Londoners who dreamt of bringing the beautiful lakes of Zurich to the capital. The original plan was to create a lido that wasn't just for swimmers, but one that would benefit the local community while also creating a haven for wildlife. The two year plan will include a sophisticated filtration system that would turn the fuel drenched Thames into crystal clear water for anyone swimming in the lido. The local community is set to be a part of the vision of the project too. The facility will be run as a social enterprise rather than a company dictated by profit. A public space created for the people that use it. Thames Baths, the Community Interest Company behind the scheme, is hoping to promote the use of the new Lido to local schools and the elderly. The crowdfunding scheme is hoping to raise a total of £125,000 within 30 days and a donation of £50 will entitle members to 12 swims. Pledging £5,000 will give investors a year's access to the lido and an opportunity to overview the development project. To donate to the Thames Bath Lido, click here.

"If a homeless man stopped you on the street and offered you money, what would you do? That is the question being posed in a new YouTube video by entertainer Yousef Saleh Erakat, who disguised himself as a homeless man and found out that the answer was often less than kind. As a man in a suit and on his cell phone walks by in the beginning of the video, Erakat gets his attention. 'I just want to be a helping hand today,' he says, offering the man a $10 bill. The man holds his money for a second, astounded, before throwing it at Erakat. 'I don't need your f***ing money, you a******. I could f***ing buy you.' YouTube entertainer Yousef Saleh Erakat disguised himself as a homeless man to see what would happen if he offered people on the street his own money instead - and found out the results were less than kind . Erakat said he wanted to 'flip the script'. Throughout the video he appears in a beanie and a cut-off hoodie jacket, holding a cardboard sign that reads, 'No one has every become poor from giving' Another man in a suit walks by, typing on his phone. 'I don't have any money man,' he says when he sees Erakat. ‘No I don’t need your money, I’m trying to give you money,' Erakat says. When the man says he doesn’t need Erakat's money the actor responds, ‘I’m just trying to help out today, here you go.’ ‘Does it look like I need your money? F***k out of here,’ the man angrily replies, slapping his hand away before walking off. 'In today's society it's socially acceptable for the wealthy to give money to the homeless,' Erakat explains in the video, posted on his fouseyTUBE channel. 'Is it acceptable because it's one individual helping another, or because one individual is better than the other - so it's okay to help?' Erakat said he wanted to 'flip the script'. Throughout the video he appears barefoot, wearing a beanie and a cut-off hoodie jacket. He holds a cardboard sign that reads, 'No one has ever become poor from giving.' Erakat said he wanted to find out if it was acceptable for the rich to give money to the poor because 'it's one individual helping another, or because one individual is better than the the other - so it's okay to help?' Another man tells Erakat to 'P*** off, mate,' when he's offered the $10 bill, and later a woman angrily asks him 'Are you trying to be funny? Are you kidding me?'. One man stops and offers Erakat his water bottle, saying he wants to help him out but it's all he has to give give at the moment. But when Erakat offers him money instead, he gets angry. 'You wanna give me money, man? F**** you prick!' the man says as he gives the seemingly homeless man the finger and yet still taking the $10 bill. Erakat's most volatile reaction comes when he offers to pay for a man's parking meter, showing him his cardboard sign. 'Let me give you something. You see that,' the man then asks, pointing to his white Mercedes Benz. 'That's a Benz - you gotta earn your way up, pal.' After Erakat tells the man that advice was the most pretentious thing he's heard all day, the two begin yelling at each other as the man continues talking about carrying a black card and driving a $50,000 C-class car. ‘It doesn't matter how much money you have, it doesn't matter what car you drive, it matters how humble you are in your heart,' Erakat says. 'And you’re not really humble saying all that,’ he continues, to which the man just responds, ‘this is LA baby!’ When Erakat tells one man he's doesn't need money, he's just trying to 'help out today,' the man ‘Does it look like I need your money? F***k out of here,’  slapping his hand away before walking off . Erakat's most volatile reaction came when he offered to pay for a man's parking meter, showing him his cardboard sign . 'Let me give you something. You see that,' the man then asks, pointing to his white Mercedes Benz. 'That's a Benz - you gotta earn your way up, pal' Only two people featured in the video listen to the seemingly homeless man's offer and want to give him something in return. One man hands Erakat back his $10 bill, adding some money of his own. 'I have all that I need too,' the man tells him. When Erakat asks, 'you're going to give me all that?' the man responds, 'it's a good message man, so positive'. 'I know you're in a rush,' Erakat says as he tries to grab the attention of one woman. When she responds that she doesn't have any cash he tells her he's actually 'trying to give you cash'. 'No keep it,' she says, walking towards him. 'You need it.' ‘Look I’m broke as it is, the only way for me to feel rich in this world is by giving what I can,' Erakat responds. 'So here you go,’ he says, reaching out to hand her the bill. Only two people featured in the video listened to the seemingly homeless man's offer and wanted to give him something in return . ‘You know what? I have a few dollars,’ one woman told him, opening her wallet. ‘Why don’t you take more and make me feel rich for the day? Go get breakfast!' ‘You know what? I have a few dollars,’ she then says, opening her wallet. ‘Why don’t you take more and make me feel rich for the day? Go get breakfast!’ Erakat gives the woman her money back before she can walk off and tells her she’s on camera. ‘I’m not trying to see who will give me money or who would not,’ he tells her. ‘But I’m just showing that the only thing they have in this world is to give to others.’ Erakat, whose YouTube channel has more than 5million subscribers, says the point of the video wasn't to see 'if people would offer us money'. Instead, the vlogger wanted to discover 'how people feel about themselves when someone who is classified as ""lesser"" than them on society's class ladder offers them money"". He admits in the YouTube description that the results were 'not expected and not wanted'. 'It doesn't matter how much you have in life if what you have in life takes away from you being humble,' he writes. 'At the end of the day, even the most poor man can be the most rich depending on how much love he has in his heart.'","Entertainer Yousef Saleh Erakat posed as a homeless man in Los Angeles .

"The story of Rapunzel, the girl trapped in a tower who is rescued by a prince climbing up her long locks, has captivated little would-be princesses the world over for centuries. But while most girls grow out of their yearning for tumbling tresses, not everyone ditches the extra-long look when they hit adulthood. As hair extensions soar in popularity on the red carpet, the number of middle-aged women with very long natural hair is on the rise, according to beauty experts. Scroll down for video . From left to right: Fiona Steane is 50 with 3ft long hair,  Sarah Rihal is also 50 and has 3ft 5in of hair, Melanie Brown is 60 and has 4ft long hair and Vanessa Thorpe is 40 with 2ft 10in of hair . And recently, supermodel Twiggy stood up for older women with long locks. ‘It makes me crazy when people say you have to cut your hair short once you hit 50,’ she said. ‘I saw a woman the other day in her late 70s with silver hair down to her waist. I thought, “Good on you, girl.”’ Here, some of Britain’s real-life Rapunzels show off their locks —and explain why they’d never consider going for the chop… . MY HAIR GETS STUCK IN CAR DOORS . Fiona Steane, 50, is an artist . She lives in London with her husband of 20 years, Christopher, 48, a banker, and their 17-year-old daughter, Amelia. Fiona Steane, 50, (pictured) wanted to cut all her hair off when she was 15 but her mother refused and she's had it long ever since then and gets it trimmed twice a year . My mother always kept my hair long. She had very long hair and she liked me to have it that way, too. I was dancing back then, so it was easier to have it long and whip it up into a bun. When I was 15, I wanted to cut it all off and my mother refused — so it’s been this way ever since. I don’t like watching people getting their hair cut and I hate hairdressers. I couldn’t even watch my husband getting his hair cut recently — there’s something about it that makes me feel sick. I get it trimmed, just getting rid of the split ends, twice a year. Then I have a conditioning treatment, which takes up to six hours but feels amazing afterwards. I don’t have a hairdryer. I’ve never used one. I don’t colour my hair. I don’t straighten it. I just shampoo, condition and leave. It’s pure laziness. This might look like it takes a lot of work but in reality I don’t have to do anything. I do make sure I use specialist hair products for long hair. When it comes to conditioner, I slather loads of it on. This keeps it nice and smooth. My cut-off point — when I know it’s got too long — is when I can sit on it. It gets stuck in car doors and it’s always in the way. Fiona (pictured) says she uses special clips from Paris to protect her hair when she wants to put it up . My hair is manageable at this length. When I want to put it up, I use special plastic clips from Paris so as not to damage my hair. An Arab man offered to buy my hair once. I thought it was hysterical. My daughter has beautiful long, thick hair. Hers is darker than mine but it’s stunning. I don’t like it when people touch my hair. I have to remind them that it’s mine. MY LONG LOCKS MAKE ME FEEL FEMININE . Sarah Rihal, 50, is a property manager from South London. She is married to Bob, 58, a pharmacist, and has two children, Alice, 27 and Jasmine, eight. Sarah Rihal, 50, (pictured) says she has had long her all her life and her youngest daughter Jasmine has hair the same length. Sarah says children in the school nursery often call her Rapunzel . I’m not a very girly girl but I’ve had long hair all my life. I went through phases when I was younger where I had shoulder-length hair, but since my late teens it’s been down to my bust. My youngest daughter, Jasmine, has hair the same length as mine. Jasmine has to wear hers plaited for school. When I pick her up, I often hear children in nursery whispering, ‘Look, it’s Rapunzel’ when we walk past. That makes me smile. I go to my hairdresser, Neil Ward, at his specialist salon Long Hair in London four times a year for a trim and conditioning treatment. The first time I went, I had my hair up in a metallic clip and Neil whipped it out and threw it in the bin. At home, I use a special shampoo and conditioner from the George Michael Long Hair range, as well as a cream rinse, which is like a conditioner that you comb through the ends after washing. I keep a jug of it in the bathroom, so I can just dunk the ends in after a shower. Sarah (pictured) uses a special shampoo from the George Michael Long Hair range, but she says there are practical difficulties with having long hair like having to plait it at night to avoid knotting . I wash my hair once a week — it does get greasy but it doesn’t usually need more than that. What I love about hair this length is that you don’t have to do anything with it. I wear it plaited or on top of my head in a bulldog clip. I just wash it and let it dry which takes about two hours. There are practical challenges to having long hair. And, at night, I have to plait it or it would get knotted around my pillow and my poor husband! My hair is my favourite part of myself. It is the one thing that makes me feel really feminine. I don’t think I’ll ever be tempted to cut it. Redheads like me tend to go white, not grey, so hopefully it will still look elegant in years to come. I GET PROPOSALS FROM STRANGERS . Melanie Brown, 60, is a retired teacher. Divorced, she has two grown-up daughters and lives in North London. Melanie Brown, 60, (pictured) says men have always found her hair attractive and that she has been proposed to twice thanks to her long locks . My hair started really growing when I was five years old and I’ve only been to a professional hairdresser twice as far as I can remember. The first time was when I was 15 and my hair was thick and long. The hairdresser cut it to my shoulders and that put me off for years. The second time was when I was in my 20s and I’d got my first teaching job. Headlice are a worry for teachers with long hair, so I marched to a hairdresser in London that specialised in long hair and said: ‘Cut it all off!’ They refused. They said it was so beautiful they wouldn’t dream of cutting it. Men have always found my hair attractive. I’ve had two proposals of marriage just because of my hair. One was from a colleague I’d only been working with for two weeks when he said he loved my hair and wanted to marry me. Not surprisingly, my ex-husband didn’t like the attention it got. Melanie (pictured) says she doesn't do anything special with her hair and washes it about once a week using whichever shampoo is cheapest . I really don’t do anything special to it. I wash it once a week with whatever shampoo is the cheapest on offer at Boots. I don’t use any special styling products, either. I just dry my hair with a hairdryer or, in the colder months when I have the heating on, I lie watching TV next to the radiator. Occasionally, I’ll get annoyed with it. But it’s part of ‘me’ now and I couldn’t imagine having it shorter. IT TAKES FOUR HOURS TO DRY NATURALLY . Vanessa Thorpe, 40, is a production editor. She lives in Essex and is divorced with one son. Vanessa Thorpe, 40, (pictured) will only use hair products that have not been tested on animals and washes and conditions her hair every morning despite the fact it takes four hours to dry naturally . I love having long hair, especially combined with its unusual colour. I don’t understand why some women feel compelled to cut their hair when they reach a certain age. I wash and condition it every morning, as it feels so much nicer. I never stick to one brand or product. I find my hair gets used to certain shampoos and conditioners and then they’re not as effective. I never buy expensive products. The products I’m using this week are Superdrug’s Pro-V, but before that I used Sainsbury’s own-brand. My only rule is that the products are not tested on animals. Vanessa (pictured) says she has never been tempted to go for a big hair cut but she has it trimmed every eight months where she has to stand up while they cut it . Washing it every day takes about ten minutes. Then I squeeze the water out with a towel and comb it through with a Tangle Teezer. It takes four hours to dry naturally, and I don’t use styling products. I’ve never been tempted to go for the chop. I had it hacked to shoulder-length when I was 13, but regretted it. I go for a trim about every eight months, and have to stand up so they can cut it. I don’t keep it this length to attract men, although I guess they like it. My boyfriend likes it, but I’d like to think he’s attracted to me and not just my mane.","Most girls grow out of their yearning for tumbling tresses as adults .

"No need to call the cops, the three men caught on camera smoking marijuana in an entertaining new video are actually former police offers themselves - and, of course, the substance that they're lighting up is completely legal. Recorded in the state of Washington, where recreational use of marijuana was legalized in July of last year, the video, created by YouTube channel Cut, sees each of the three ex-cops taking hits from a bong, before offering their thoughts, both funny and thoughtful, on the controversial substance. 'It's like the last piece of prohibition,' says Robert, 73, who worked as a police officer from 1970 to 1986 before performing criminal justice training for another decade. 'I think it should be legal [and] I think it should be more widely available for medical reasons.' Scroll down for video . Doobie discussions: Former police officers Rene, left, Robert, center, and David, right, discuss marijuana while smoking from a bong in a new video produced by Cut . Released on April 20, which is affectionately referred to as 420, a day widely regarded by marijuana users as the national day for getting high, the video shows the three men smoking several times over the course of a few hours while discussing the drug, eating snacks, and playing games, including crude card game Cards Against Humanity. 'I tried it once and I tell you, I was on a waterbed with a very agreeable woman and listening to Rhapsody in Blue, which I know lasts for about 18 minutes and 40 seconds, and it lasted for, oh hell, two or three hours,' says Robert. David, who served as a reserve police officer from 1997 to 2004, says he smoked for the first time at the age 14, but stopped for a while afterward because he got caught. 'The last time I smoked was probably in 1968 when I was in college,' says Rene, 67, who was on the force from 1970 to 1997. Celebrating 420: The video was released on April 20, which is regarded by many smokers as the national day to get high . They've got the munchies: The three ex-cops snacked on chips and cookies while they smoked and talked for several hours . In between bong hits and self-administered field sobriety tests, the trio debates the dangers and benefits of using marijuana. Rene says that one argument for legalizing the drug is knowing what you're getting when you buy it; he explains that when people get it on the street, they don't always know what their marijuana has been cut with. Sometimes it can be mixed with more dangerous substances. While they disagree on whether it's a gateway drug - Robert notes that every heroin addict started out drinking milk, implying that it's difficult to link the use of one product to another - they all seem to agree that legal repercussions for using marijuana do more harm than good. 'It costs more to put someone in prison than it does to send someone to Harvard,' says Robert, suggesting that sending people to prison for marijuana possession or distribution is a wasteful drain on society. 'As far as I can remember, I never arrested anyone for it, but I took a lot of pot away from people and threw it away in front of them,' says Rene, adding that he thought that his personal punishment was a bigger deterrent than writing them a citation. Pot partakers: Rene, left, says he never wrote a criminal citation to someone with marijuana, but would throw out their drugs in front of them; while he served, it was illegal in every state . Special cause: The video links to Shona Banda's GoFundMe page, which is raising money for the Kansas mother's legal defense; her 11-year-old son was taken away from her for discussing medical marijuana . At one point, the interviewer tells the former officers that some people report feeling sexually aroused when they smoke. 'I'm 73 years old, I don't know what the hell you're talking about!' answers Robert. 'It's been so long since I've made love, I can't remember who ties up whom!' While the ex-cops' cracks are certainly meant to elicit laughs, the video also aims to promote the GoFundMe page of activist Shona Banda. The Kansas mother's 11-year-old son was taken away from her late last month when, during a drug discussion at his school, he extolled the benefits of medical  marijuana. Shona, who used cannabis oil to treat her Crohn’s disease, is now raising money for her legal fees.","The video was filmed in the state of Washington, where recreational use of marijuana was legalized in July of last year .

"A young mother and her three children have been found murdered in their home. LaTasha Gosling, 27, of Tisdale, Saskatchewan, and her two daughters, Janyaa, 4, and Jenika, 8, and her son Landen, 7, were discovered early Wednesday one day after they were reported missing. The suspect in the case was found just hours later dead, and while police would not say how he died they did say that it was not a homicide. He also had a six-month-old baby with him who was unharmed. LaTasha Gosling, 27,  and her two daughters, Janyaa, 4, and Jenika, 8, and her son Landen, 7, (above) were discovered early Wednesday . They had been murdered at their home in Tisdale, Saskatchewan (above) 'Very, very devastating finding out my sister and the kids are actually really dead and they're not coming back,' Laura Gross, the victim's sister, told CBC News. 'That's been very, very difficult for me.' Police have yet to release much information at this time, only saying that the suspect and victim did know one another. A woman who lives in the same mobile park as the family said that a man lived with the mother and three children, and described them as a 'hard working, young family.' She added; 'They were very quiet and I had no problems with them at all.' Family of the Goslings are now trying to raise money for their funeral services, and have started a GoFundMe page. 'With the public's help we hope to get nice caskets, headstones and any other cost that may arise,' reads the page. 'Any little bit helps and will be more appreciated than you could ever imagine.' They have already exceeded their initial goal of $5,000. A memorial has also been set up outside the family's home.","LaTasha Gosling, 27, of Tisdale, Saskatchewan, was found murdered in her home early Wednesday .

"From awkwardly handing a beggar some change, to failing at eating a bacon sandwich, it is fair to say Labour spin doctors have so far failed to make Ed Miliband look cool. But now Twitter users are attempting to give the somewhat uninspiring party leader a makeover, by editing his face on to famous men's bodies.

"Jet-setter: Elvis Presley bought both planes in 1975 . They've been one of the biggest highlights of Graceland for 30 years. But Elvis Presley’s planes are to be taken from the grounds of his former mansion after local officials signed off the controversial deal. Memphis City Council agreed yesterday that Hound Dog II and Lisa Marie – named after the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll’s daughter – can be moved from his estate to a site nearby. It means tourists to Graceland will have to pay extra if they want to see the two jets, which are to form a new, separate museum about the dead singer. Graceland visitors can currently buy a ticket that includes a tour of Presley's home-turned-museum and the interiors of the two planes. They have been at the estate since the mid-1980s after Graceland’s managing company, Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE), agreed that the planes’ owner, OKC Partnership, could have a cut of Graceland ticket sales. OKC spokesman Tim McCaskill told Memphis City Council this week that the goal was for construction work at the planes’ new home to be finished in time for them to be moved there for Elvis Week in August. The site is on the same street as Graceland. Big hit: The Lisa Marie, pictured in the grounds of Graceland, was given a major overhaul by Elvis . Hound Dog II: The smaller jet was used by the star during Lisa Marie's refit and was also his back-up plane . OKC has been in a lengthy dispute with EPE, which was bought by New York-based Authentic Brands Group in 2013. Last April, EPE sent a letter to OKC, saying it was exercising its option to end their agreement and asking OKC ‘to make arrangements for the removal of the airplanes and the restoration of the site on or shortly after April 26, 2015’. At one stage, Elvis’s former wife Priscilla stepped into the heated row - telling fans who were outraged at the prospect of the planes being moved to ‘calm down’. Elvis's bedroom: The Lisa Marie had a custom-made, queen-sized bed for the star, who liked to fly at night . Perfectly preserved: A table and chairs in the plane. The seats are now covered in plastic to protect them . Lounge in the sky: There are four TVs in total plus a videotape system in the Lisa Marie . Hot on design: Presley, who oversaw the plane's refurbishment, insisted on gold bathroom taps . Then last September, OKC put them up for sale, saying if they couldn’t stay at Elvis’s former home, they would have to be sold. OKC owner KG Coker, 77, said at the time: ‘I would love to see the airplanes stay where they are forever. ‘Millions of fans have toured those airplanes and there's a real connection between fans and those airplanes. They are part of the Elvis experience.’ The jets were expected to fetch $15million in an auction in January. But they were withdrawn from sale, and OKC made arrangements to have them displayed on land adjacent to Graceland. Hound Dog II was bought by Elvis for $900,000 in September 1975 – less than two years before his death. In November 1975 he paid $250,000 for the larger but secondhand plane Lisa Marie, and spent at least $300,000 having it renovated. He would use Hound Dog II - a Lockheed Jetstar - to fly to Lisa Marie’s hangar to see how the refit was going. When it was finished, Hound Dog II became his back-up jet. Both planes were sold after the singer’s death in August 1977 and bought a few years later by OKC. The Lisa Marie was installed at Graceland in 1984 and the Hound Dog II soon afterwards. Small but comfortable: The eye-catching lime-green and yellow seats in Elvis's Hound Dog II jet . Current home: The jets have been at Graceland since the 1980s, where they have their own entrance (right) Heated debate: Elvis's ex-wife Priscilla Presley joined in the row over whether the planes should stay at Graceland with this tweet to his fans last year. She turned the home into a tourist destination after he died . The Lisa Marie was bought by Elvis from Delta Air Lines in November 1975 for $250,000. It was originally built in 1960, and the singer spent at least $300,000 having the interior overhauled to suit his tastes. He gave it a penthouse-style bedroom with a queen-size bed and in-flight library, an executive conference room finished in teak - and a bathroom with gold sink and taps. The plane also had a bar, four TVs with a videotape system and a state-of-the-art stereo system with 52 speakers. Elvis had the plane painted red, white and blue with his motto TCB - for 'Takin' Care of Business' - on the tail. It was decked out by a team that had previously designed the US president’s plane, Air Force One. During the refurbishment, the Lisa Marie was in a hangar in Fort Worth. Elvis took great pleasure in flying friends there in his smaller Hound Dog II jet to check on the progress of the refit, which he personally oversaw. The Lisa Marie - a four-engine 28-passenger Convair - could fly Presley up to 3,000 miles (4,800km). On each flight there would typically be three crew members. It could hold a maximum of 29 people but usually there would be around eight. The custom-made bed was particularly important to Elvis as he preferred to travel by night. The last journey the plane made for the family was in August 1977 when it transported Elvis's ex-wife Priscilla and his good friend George Hamilton from California to his funeral at Graceland. Priscilla Presley and her then husband Elvis board a private jet in the 1960s. The couple separated in 1972 .","The two jets have been permanent fixtures at Memphis estate for 30 years .

"A jealous boyfriend stabbed his love rival to death after he threatened show intimate photographs of her to her Imam father. Gulam Chowdhury, 24, quoted verses from the Quran before stabbing Mohammed Yasser Afzal 20 times in the east London mini cab office where his victim worked. The court heard that Nargis Riaz, 22, was terrified that Mr Afzal would show intimate photographs to her father who was a strict Imam. Gulam Chowdhury, left, stabbed his love rival Mohammed Afzal, right, 20 times at an east London cab office . The Old Bailey heard that Mr Afzal had threatened to show intimate pictures of Nargis Riaz, to her Imam father . The Old Bailey heard that Ms Riaz had been involved in a relationship with Chowdhury and Mr Riaz for several weeks before the murder on March 24, 2014. Her parents were unaware she was friendly with either man. Chowdhury told Ms Riaz, a second year law student at City University, the attack was justified in Islam claiming: 'Cut the neck of the man who eyed up his wife.' Later he reassured her: 'Don't worry little angel, it's me who's a psycho not you.' Chowdhury showed no emotion today as a jury of seven men and five women found him guilty of the murder of Mr Afzal, 22, on March 24 last year. Riaz, who was also standing trial for murder, faces a retrial after the jury failed to reach a verdict after 21 hours and 37 minutes’ deliberation. Co-defendant Muhammed Khan, 23, was acquitted of assisting an offender. The court heard Ms Riaz had been dating both Chowdhury and Mr Afzal in the weeks before the murder, but kept both relationships from her strict parents. Dramatic CCTV footage showed masked Chowdhury storm the E20 minicab company in Stratford Broadway, east London on March 24 last year. Muhammad Khan, pictured, was acquitted of assisting an offender at the Old Bailey . He vaulted the counter armed with a carving knife as Riaz was stood outside during the frenzied attack. Detectives investigating the murder found a series of texts from Chowdhury to her in the weeks leading up to the attack. In one message, Chowdhury repeatedly asked Riaz if she wanted his rival dead and told her: ‘No one hurts Nargis and lives’. Having converted to a strict form of Islam while held in an immigration detention centre, Chowdhury regularly quoted the Quran in his messages to Riaz. He told her: ‘I’m going to sort this out and sort it proper, I will use the flame from my ancestors to burn the world of this scum.’ He also wrote in another message that his ancestors were ‘fearless lions that would kill for honour’. Chowdhury claimed killing was justified by Islam and included a passage from the Quran which said: ‘Cut the neck of the man who eyed up his wife’. In another text he wrote: ‘I need to kill someone’. Prosecutor Sandip Patel QC said Riaz was treated ‘like a Queen’ by Mr Afzal, but had threatened to show intimate pictures to her parents during a ‘difficult phase’ in their relationship. ‘They had known each other before and had been boyfriend and girlfriend in the past but Mr Afzal was unaware Miss Riaz was at that time seeing Mr Chowdhury,’ he said. Riaz, who also worked at Primark in Hackney, claimed she did not believe Chowdhury would carry out his threats. Chowdhury, from Barking, denied, but was convicted of murder. He was held at Broadmoor secure hospital prior to the trial, and was initially deemed unfit to plead due to mental health problems. Riaz, also from Barking, denied murder. Khan, from Dagenham, Essex, denied assisting an offender between March 24 and March 26, 2014 and was acquitted. Speaking outside the court, Detective Inspector Euan McKeeve of the Homicide and Major Command said: 'Gulam Chowdhury carried out a ferocious assault on Mohammed Afzal. The level of violence used was shocking and ensured that Mohammed would not survive the attack. 'Whatever Mohammed's motives were for the actions he took in attempting to maintain his relationship with a woman, he did not deserve to be murdered. 'It is thanks to the thorough and meticulous work of my officers who have worked tirelessly since Mohammed's murder that we have managed to prove Chowdhury planned, and then executed, this vicious assault which ended in the savage murder of a young man.' Eyewitnesses described how Chowdhury was wearing a distinctive 'JD Sports' shoulder bag shortly before the murder. Officers then were able to place him at the scene using CCTV footage and mobile phone cell data analysis. Chowdhury is due to be sentenced on May 1.

'I have a friend who is a former oncology nurse who tells me that when your hair falls out, it means the chemo is working,' she said. 'That’s the attitude I took into this. I miss my hair, but I took what she said to heart: My bald head means I have a fight and I look at it as being fortunate to have a battle.' For her first assignment back, Smith will head to Hawaii and be with Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota for a feature that will air prior to the draft. Mariota, the winner of this year's Heiman Trophy, is expected by most pundits to go first or second in the draft alongside Florida star, and fellow quarterback, Jameis Winston.

"From the moment I set foot on my terrace overlooking the scenic Douro river to the divine meal I ate at its Michelin-starred restaurant, The Yeatman played a wonderful trick on me. The five-star hotel in Porto celebrates all things wine - Port wine, in particular - and has the feel of a place steeped in decades-old tradition, with a prime location, classic design and unblemished attention to detail. But, to my surprise, The Yeatman has been open for just five years - a fraction of the age of some of the pricier bottles in its wine cellar. In those five years it has been hitting all the right notes, developing a reputation as a haven for wine lovers and one of Portugal’s best luxury hotels. The Bacchus suite at The Yeatman boasts a high-vaulted wooden ceiling, copper Jacuzzi, fireplace and a rotating bed . Portugal's first wine hotel is built into a hill, providing sweeping views of Porto and the Douro river from the indoor pool and guest rooms . When guests arrive at The Yeatman they set foot in a stunning lobby with a statue of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine . For guests like myself, who know little about wine but will never allow it to go to waste, it presents an opportunity to learn and develop an appreciation for the picturesque Douro region’s nectar. Even though the hotel is dedicated to wine, it’s not just for enthusiasts. Regardless of their knowledge or palate, guests can take advantage of two other things that The Yeatman specialises in: relaxation and imaginative food. When I arrived on a Friday night I stepped into the immaculate lobby - accentuated with a statue of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine - to the sound of an acoustic guitar drifting from Dick’s Bar, the in-house bar where couples canoodle on couches and bartenders mix Port wine cocktails. With more than 80 wines by the glass it is the only bar in Porto to remain open 24 hours a day. Public spaces inside the five-star hotel, including the lobby and Dick's Bar, offer a breathtaking view of Portugal's second-largest city . The Yeatman is located in Vila Nova de Gaia; it is separated from Porto by the Douro river, which spills into the Atlantic Ocean . The Yeatman's large decanter-shaped infinity pool is heated and surrounded by a terrace with plenty of space to lounge in the sun . From the statue of Bacchus, guests’ attention usually moves to the large glass doors and windows that offer sweeping views of the river and the Luis I Bridge, which links Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia. Guests are afforded the same luxury when they enter their room and set foot on the private terrace, which has impressive views across the river of Portugal’s second-largest city. The Yeatman, Portugal’s first luxury wine hotel, is built into a hill in Vila Nova de Gaia, with all of its 82 rooms facing the river and almost every one themed after a Portuguese winery. Guest rooms at The Yeatman face the river, and almost all of them are themed after a Portuguese winery (pictured: superior room) Each guest room is decorated in an understated, classic style, with a private terrace where guests can relax outdoors . No visit to Porto in northern Portugal is complete without a sampling of its most famous export - Port wine. Guests at The Yeatman are just a short walk from Taylor’s wine lodges and cellars, where its Port wine ages in thousands of barrels. Owned by Taylor, Fladgate & Yeatman, which owns the hotel, the compound offers informative tours and tastings, with visitors learning about the history of the sweet wine and the House of Taylor’s, which is in its fourth century. After the tour guests are offered three Port wines - chip dry (extra dry white), late bottled vintage and 10-year-old tawny - and they can pay extra to sample premium Port wines. My tour included a stop inside one of the cellars, which houses nearly 2,000 barrels containing Port wine as old as 1880 and a giant barrel capable of holding 100,000 litres. Located next door to The Yeatman, Taylor's Port wine cellars offers affordable informational tours and tastings for visitors . My superior room, themed after the Quinta do Passadouro winery, was decorated with its labelled bottles, photos of its vineyard and regional artefacts, plus vintage-like furniture and lime green curtains, giving it a luxurious but laid-back feel. Like the rooms, each floor has a theme. Floor one, where the outdoor pool is located, is decorated with framed maps of Portugal, while other floors focus on local history or Portuguese discoveries. Wine is front and centre at this polished hotel, owned by centuries-old Port wine producer Taylor, Fladgate & Yeatman, but one could argue that the real star of the show is the Gastronomic Restaurant. The restaurant at The Yeatman is the only one in Porto to carry a Michelin star, offering exceptional service and creative dishes . Tasting menus include dishes such as crispy suckling pig belly (pictured), and codfish with corn bread crumble and chickpea puree . It is the only restaurant in Porto to carry a Michelin star, and during my visit I was treated to a two-hour culinary masterclass with exceptional service and creative dishes from start to finish. The tasting menu included a langoustine broth with crunchy langoustine and Champagne sauce, roasted codfish with corn bread crumble and chickpea puree, crispy suckling pig belly with cardinal prawn slices and herb sprouts, and a chocolate cafe with toffee and caramel ice cream - all paired with Portuguese wines. Best enjoyed before indulging, guests can spoil themselves at the Caudalie Vinotherapie Spa, which offers a number of treatments that stick with the hotel’s wine theme. Guests can spoil themselves at the Caudalie Vinotherapie Spa, which offers a number of treatments that stick with the wine theme . Spa visits include access to a Roman bath (pictured), sauna and The Yeatman’s indoor panoramic infinity pool . Spectacular views are enjoyed from the spa’s private barrel bath rooms, where guests relax in bubbling water enriched with a grape extract . I was treated to the spa’s signature massage - the Caudalie relaxing massage, with grape extract oils - after spending some time in the relaxation room, which offers another impressive vantage point of the hustle and bustle across the river. TAP Portugal (www.flytap.com, 0345 601 0932) flies from London Gatwick to Porto 14 times a week, with return fares starting at £120 including all taxes and surcharges. Porto Airport is just a 20-minute drive from The Yeatman. Spectacular views can also be enjoyed from the spa’s private barrel bath rooms, where guests relax in bubbling water enriched with a conditioning grape extract. The spa has two levels connected by a spiral staircase set within a giant port wine barrel, and guests also have access to a Roman bath, sauna and The Yeatman’s indoor panoramic infinity pool. From the spa to the restaurant and everywhere in between, everything at The Yeatman comes back to wine, with the hotel acting as an ambassador. One of the features that should delight anyone with an appreciation for it is a ‘working cellar’ on the lower level . Open two hours every day, guests can head down with a sommelier to pick out a wine - from Portugal or another wine-producing nation - to pair with their dinner. After my two-night stay at The Yeatman I still consider myself a novice when it comes to the finer points of wine, but I left feeling confident that there will be fewer surprises the next time I pick up a bottle at the supermarket.

"A paralyzed former police officer who advocated for wheelchair users has died after accidentally driving his ATV off an Idaho cliff and plunging 500 feet. Tom McTevia, 42, who was left without the use of his legs following another ATV accident 11 years ago, was traveling with a group and driving his friend Tina Hoisington, 45, near an overlook at Lake Pend Oreille in Bonner County on Sunday. When the group stopped for a photograph around noon, McTevia's ATV got too close to the edge of the 2,000-foot cliff and went over, witnesses told Selkirk Fire Rescue, the CDA Press reported. A firefighter reached the first victim's body after rappelling down 500 feet of rock, and the second victim was found 1,100 feet below the edge, Fire Rescue said. A helicopter recovered their bodies. Loss: 42-year-old Tom McTevia, pictured on a trail he campaigned to make accessible for wheelchairs, has died after accidentally plunging over the edge of an Idaho overlook while on his ATV . Victim: His passenger and best friend, Tina Hoisington, pictured, also died in the accident on Sunday . The news has stunned the community of Coeur d'Alene, where McTevia had long campaigned for wheelchair users to get better access to outdoor activities. McTevia, a Navy veteran and father-of-one, had been left paralyzed in another ATV accident in 2004, when he was an Orofino police officer. He suffered a spinal cord injury that left him without the use of his legs and with limited use of his arms and hands, and he was forced to leave the police department, the Spokesman Review reported. Despite his physical challenges, he continued to live an active lifestyle and enjoyed kayaking, hunting, skydiving and cycling by operating the bike with his hands. He moved to Coeur d'Alene in 2006 and volunteered at the records department of the Coeur d'Alene Police Department. Crash: A fire rescue image shows the damaged ATV after the fall. Both victims fell out of the vehicle . Scene: They were at this scene overlook at at Lake Pend Oreille in Bonner County when they fell . In 2009, he took part in the National Veterans Wheelchair Games in Spokane. Most recently, he pushed for the city to make a section of a 1,500-foot trail at Tubbs Hill accessible to wheelchair users by making the incline gentler. 'He just absolutely felt so passionate about that project,' Orofino Mayor Ryan Smathers told the CDA Press. 'He missed being able to walk in the outdoors, so he at least wanted to still experience the outdoors.' In February, he spoke to Live Well Cda magazine about his outlook on life. 'I don't like the word ""handicap"",' he said. 'I don't like the word ""disability"". Disability is a state of mind, or it's a broken-down vehicle on the side of the road. Active: McTevia was left paralyzed by another ATV accident in 2004 but continued to stay active . Hobbies: He continued to go kayaking, hunting and skydiving despite his physical challenges . 'I'm minorly inconvenienced. Every person on this planet has an inconvenience, and it is all in how you approach it.' McTevia leaves behind one son, who lives in California and graduated high school last year. Friends told KREM that McTevia and Hoisington, from Lewiston, Idaho, were best friends who went on dozens of outdoor trips together. She had worked at the Lewis Clark Credit Union as a loan officer for 15 years. 'Our hearts are breaking,' CEO Trisha Baker said in a statement released on Monday. 'Tina touched so many lives… We will miss her laugh and her awesome sense of humor.'","Tom McTevia, 42, and his passenger and best friend, Tina Hoisington, 45, died after their ATV plunged from an Idaho overlook on Sunday .

"A pub landlord who was convicted of drink driving after claiming he was sleepwalking and was not drunk has vowed to never drink again. James Boase, landlord of the Coppa Dolla pub in Broadhempston, Devon had been drinking with a friend in Torquay on March 13, 2014. The 36-year-old publican told Torquay Magistrates' Court that the last thing he could remember was going to bed at approximately 12.30am and then awoke beside his car which had been involved in a car crash. James Boase, pictured, failed to stop after hitting another car on March 13, 2014 near his Devon pub, pictured . Mr Boase claimed that he went to bed around 12.30am and must have been sleep walking . He insisted he had been 'sleep walking'. However prosecutors insisted he had failed to stop his black Nissan Navara after being involved in a collision with a Citroen Berlingo. Police arrived at Boase's house where they found him standing next to his car. He told the court: 'I remember being confused and slightly frustrated.I honestly don’t know how I got there. 'I remember seeing the car and being completely shocked. I believe I must have gone into my friend’s house and gone to bed. 'At the time I was unaware I had any sort of sleeping disorder. 'There were questions unanswered causing me a lot of problems, I was worried and scared and sought medical help to get some answers.' The court heard how Boase had 75 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, more than double the legal limit. At Torquay Magistrates' Court, District Judge Kevin Grey dismissed Boase’s claims of sleepwalking and found him guilty of drink-driving, failing to stop after an accident, failing to report an accident, and driving dangerously. Boase has been remanded on unconditional bail until May 12 for a pre-sentence report, and was disqualified from driving in the meantime. Boase, who has two previous convictions for drink-driving, said: 'My intention is never to drink again.'","James Boase was twice the drink-drive limit when he struck a car .

"The Zulu king blamed for sparking the violence against foreigners which has seen South Africa's streets turn into battlefields running with blood over the past two weeks is no stranger to scandal. It was just a couple of years ago that King Goodwill Zwelithini - who last month said foreigners should 'pack their belongings' and leave - labelled homosexuals as 'rotten'. The dyed-in-the-wool traditionalist has also courted the wrath of women's rights and HIV/Aids campaigners for his hardline stance on controversial traditional virginity testing. Scroll down for video . Controversial: King Goodwill Zwelithini (pictured) has been blamed for sparking the xenophobic riots which has left at least seven dead in the last couple of weeks as it spreads from Durban to Johannesburg . Horrific: The brutal murder of Mozambican man Emmanuel Sithole in a township near Johannesburg was captured on camera. Zwelithini has been blamed for sparking outbursts of xenophobic violence like this . Xenophobia: The King is said to have told followers in a speech that foreigners were 'lice' and 'ants' and should be expelled from South Africa - a charge he denies, saying it was bad translation . Frenzy: A burnt-out car in the Jeppestown area of Johannesburg. King Zwelithini recently told a crowd of 10,000 that if he had really ordered people to be killed 'this country would be reduced to ashes' Obscene: Zola Mafu arrives at the Ondini Sports Complex in Ulundi in a Rolls Royce for her wedding to King Zwelithini in July. She became his sixth wife at the lavish ceremony . King Zwelithini resurrected the outdated custom, in the face of widespread opposition, by claiming it helped the country's fight against HIV/Aids. But more recently, there was the revelation that he was bankrupt - despite the 54million rand (£3million) handed to him from the South African government to keep the 67-year-old, his six wives and 28 children in the style to which they are accustomed. And, as a man who likes to spend more on his birthday cake than many of his subjects earn in a lifetime, it is quite some lifestyle. While King Zwelithini continues to enjoy all the trappings of his royal status, South African authorities arrested 11 men in Johannesburg late on Tuesday suspected of involvement in violence against immigrants, local television news reported. The men were held during a joint raid by the police and army on a Johannesburg hostel. A wave of anti-immigrant violence has so far claimed seven lives in trouble spots in Durban and Johannesburg, to where the government announced the deployment of defence forces on Tuesday. A speech given by the King in Durban last month, denouncing foreigners as 'ants' and 'lice' who should leave the country, has been blamed for sparking the violence. The hellish scenes across townships in South Africa are a far cry from King Zwelithini's opulent marriage to his sixth wife Zola Mafu, a 28-year-old princess from the neighbouring kingdom of Swaziland, in July, which included a marquee, catering and flowers for 5,000 invited guests. According to South Africa's Sunday Times, the monarch paid out more than £55,000 on catering, around £10,000 on a sound system and £15,000 on decorations and flowers. In total, the extravaganza, attended by 5,000 people, cost an estimated £250,000. Maintaining all six wives, their children and grandchildren in separate palaces, with generous allowances, private school fees and a retinue of personal staff, requires substantial funding, according to reports. And he decided they all needed new, imported military regalia to wear to the opening of KwaZulu Natal's state legislature later this year - at the not insignificant price of £155,000, the Times claimed. Defence: Zwelithini also claimed his words were badly translated in 2012 when he called gay people 'rotten' Nuptials: His wedding to sixth wife Zola Mafu (pictured) in July cost an estimated R4million, or about £250,000 . Opulent: Another scene from Mafu's wedding to the king. She was selected as his bride at the age of 18 while participating in the 2003 Swazi reed dance . Power: Zwelithini's speech last month is said to be the cause of the violence which has turned the streets into a battleground, sending foreigners running for the safety of special camps . Luxurious: But the King - pictured here right at the annual reed dance at eNyokeni Royal Palace last year - more often comes under fire for lavish spending on his six wives, 28 children and numerous grandchildren . Funding: Zwelithini is given R54million (about £3million) by the South African government each year . But that is not to say the King, who became leader of South Africa's biggest tribal group aged just 20 in 1968, does not have previous form on exorbitant expenditure. In 2012, King Zwelithini asked for half a million pounds for a new palace for Queen Mafu - as well as an extra million pounds on fifth wife Queen MaMchiza's home, in Nongoma, which boasts five royal residences. Four years before, the royal family had come under fire for spending more than £16,000 on linen. And just last month, the Sunday Times reported that the King had bought each of his queens a new Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan, in addition to a seventh model 'as a back up'. The monarch's opulent lifestyle is in stark contrast to millions of South Africans who, more than two decades after winning freedom, still do not have access to basic services such as clean water and electricity. But despite opposition politicians hitting out at the huge amounts lavished upon King Zwelithini and his family, it is unlikely to change. As South Africa celebrates 21 years of democracy next week, the largesse enjoyed by the king at the taxpayers' expense appears assured – at least while controversial president and fellow Zulu Jacob Zuma clings to power. Mr Zuma, who himself has four wives and at least 20 children, has relied on the influential leader to deliver political support, both to him personally and the governing ANC. Joy: The new King and Queen celebrate during their wedding, yet Zwelithini is a man who likes to spend more on his birthday cake than many of his subjects earn in a lifetime . Bankrupt: But the King (centre) ran out of money last year following a particularly expensive few months, and had to beg for more funds - which the government, led by fellow Zulu Jacob Zuma (left), approved . Households: The King has also asked for more than a million pounds to build or renovate his wives' palaces . Followers: But despite the extravagances, the King - pictured with Prince Charles in 2011 - is still adored by millions of people, many impoverished, willing to follow his every instruction . Raid: Zulu hostel dwellers on the staircase during a joint South African Police and army raid in Johannesburg yesterday. The raid was aimed at tackling gangs which have been hunting down and killing foreigners . Hands up: Zulus up against a wall waiting to be searched during the police raid on the hostel last night . Fearful: Potential gang members lie face down on the floor during the police and army action at the hostel . In return, the king enjoys a budget far higher than South Africa's other royal households and chiefdoms. Indeed, the South African government waved through an extra two million rand (£110,600) just last month, to help him get to the end of the financial year. What's more, his allowance looks set to rise to R63million (£3.5million) a year by 2017. And none of this takes into account the amount the South African taxpayer is having to shoulder thanks to the inflammatory speech he gave in March. 'We ask the foreign nationals to pack their belongings and go back to their countries,' he said during the speech in Durban. King Zwelithini has blamed bad reporting for his alleged hate speech, yet his attempt to call for calm this week contained a clear, but rather chilling hint at the power the firebrand believes he wields over his predominantly impoverished, young followers. He told a crowd of 10,000 that if he had really ordered people to be killed 'this country would be reduced to ashes'. Even so, the South African government has been forced to declare 'an emergency' over the issue, ordering troops onto the streets of its most volatile townships where disaffected locals have been ransacking shacks in search of migrants they accuse of stealing job and business opportunities. At least 7,000 foreigners are sheltering in camps for their safety and more than 900 have fled, including to Zimbabwe where despot Robert Mugabe's government has likened the monarch's alleged remarks to those made in the run up to the genocide in Rwanda 20 years ago.

"A mother managed to raise £2,000 in just 24 hours to pay a special helmet for her son, who was born with flat-head syndrome. Kate Roberts, 24, noticed her son Miles had a slightly different shaped head when he was born, and at three months, he was diagnosed with brachycephaly, also known as 'flat head syndrome'. This when the back of the head becomes flattened, causing the head to widen and the front of the skull to bulge out. Doctors believe it is caused by babies sleeping on their back, and as it is not medically dangerous, the NHS does not pay for treatment. Instead, parents are advised to move their children on to their stomachs during the day. Scroll down for video . Kate Thomas raise £2,000 in just one day to pay for a special helmet for her son Miles, who was born with flat head syndrome . Flat head syndrome is where the back of the head becomes flattened, causing the head to widen and the front of the skull to bulge out. It is thought to be caused by babies sleeping on their back . But after doing some research Mrs Thomas was shocked to discover the condition can lead to facial disfigurement and even blindness. The mother-of-two visited a private clinic and was told Miles, now eight months, needed cranium orthosis treatment, known as 'helmet treatment', that costs around £2000. She set up a GoFundMe account and wrote a Facebook status describing Miles' situation and in just 24 hours she had raised the money that she needed. The call centre advisor, of Sunderland, said: 'We noticed his head was a slightly different shape when he was born. 'I had twins and his head looked a lot different to his sister Aoife's. 'When he was three months it became a lot more visible and we took him to the doctors. 'They had a feel of his head and felt mine and my husband's and realised it was not hereditary.' Miles was referred to Sunderland Hospital in January 2015, where doctors carried out X-rays to rule out craniosynostosis, a more serious head condition that can cause headaches, learning difficulties and eye problems. They found he did not have this condition and diagnosed flat head syndrome. As it is a cosmetic, rather than medical problem, the NHS said it would not pay for treatment. Doctors say if parents move their babies onto their tummies during the day, as well as changing them from different chairs, so there isn't constant pressure on the back of the head, the condition should improve within eight weeks. Babies sometimes develop a flattened head when they're a few months old, usually from sleeping on their back. It's known as 'flat head syndrome' or 'moulding'. Sometimes the head can be flattened on one side (known as plagiocephaly) or the back of the head becomes flattened, causing the head to widen and the skull to bulge out (known as bracycephaly). The head can be flattened in the womb, and the condition is more common in babies born prematurely because they're squeezed through the birth canal when their skulls haven't fully developed. But the most common cause is because babies now sleep on their backs every night – a position doctors advise to prevent cot death. When they lie on their backs, the full weight of their heads rests on the back of their skulls and the pressure of the mattress on their soft skull causes it to become flat. The conditions is not thought to be medically dangerous. Doctors advise changing the baby's position in the day to relieve pressure on the back of its head, and it will often correct itself over time. However, they warn parents not to change their baby's sleeping position from lying on their back at night. It's very important for babies to sleep on their back, because it reduces the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Source: NHS Choices . But Mrs Thomas became worried about the shape of Miles' head, and began researching the condition online. She said: 'They did reassure me that he would have no further problems but I wasn't convinced. 'I was a bit shocked and felt a bit isolated. 'I got told off by my husband for worrying but after looking around on the internet and noticed the consequences that could happen if Miles did not get the treatment he needed.' 'We went to a private clinic and they said he could have serious facial disfigurement and that he could lose sight in his right eye. 'They said his eye was already set back 16mm and this could cause serious problems.' The clinic recommended a treatment known as helmet therapy, in which babies wear a custom-built helmet which applies pressure to the bulging parts of the baby's skull and relieves pressure from the flatter parts, allowing growth in these areas. The controversial treatment is not available on the NHS as doctors say there is not enough evidence it works if parents change their babies position in the day. Worried about Miles' eyesight, Mrs Thomas decided to raise the money for the special helmet, which costs around £2,000. She decided setup a GoFundMe page online and hosting raffles in her local pub. She said: 'The response was incredible. I needed £1950 so I thought I would have a raffle and a charity night in my local pub to start off the fundraising. 'I then put a Facebook status up describing what Miles needed and set up a gofundme page. 'I started the page at 5.30pm on Thursday and by 9.30pm on Friday night we had the money raised. 'I am stunned by everyone's generosity and can't believe that people would be so kind. As flat head syndrome is considered a cosmetic problem, the NHS doesn't fund treatment. But Mrs Thomas went to a private clinic who warned Miles could lose his sight due to the condition . Thanks to donations from friends and strangers, Miles will be fitted with a custom-built helmet later this month, which he will have to wear for six months to change the shape of his head . 'A man from Newcastle that I don't even know donated £500 and simply wrote ""hope this helps"" as his message on the site.' Miles will be fitted with a  helmet on April 30th and will need to wear it for five to six months to change the shape of his head. Mrs Thomas said she is relieved her son will be treated and believes more research should be carried out into flat head syndrome. She said: 'I'm delighted that he is finally getting his treatment and would again like to thank everyone who donated. 'I don't think there has been enough study into this syndrome but if there are genuine chances of facial disfigurement then it surely needs more attention. 'It was now or never as after 14 months his head would not have been able to be fixed. 'I hope this works as we just want our beautiful smiley Miley to be OK.' Treatment may not be necessary in mild cases of plagiocephaly or brachycephaly. The baby's skull should correct itself naturally over time if parents take some simple measures to take pressure off the flattened part of their head and encourage them to try different positions. Doctors advise: . Parents may need to try these measures for six to eight weeks before they notice an improvement in the shape of the baby's head.

"Firefighters were forced to chisel through a brick wall to free a pet cat who became stuck upside down in between a tiny gap in two garages. Grey and white cat Marv somehow managed to get wedged in a five inch gap in between owner Brendon Veale's garage and his neighbours in Hanham, Bristol and was left dangling for two hours. The RSPCA were called and they too were unable to coax the pet from the gap and eventually firefighters had to tunnel through a garage wall with a chisel to get him free. Scroll down for video . Grey and white cat Marv was left hanging for upside for over two hours and the RSPCA were unable to coax him out . Marv was shaken by his ordeal but uninjured and was eventually reunited with Mr Veale's two daughters Tilly and Bella. The rescue unfolded last Wednesday when a neighbour heard miaowing coming from the side of his garage. RSPCA animal welfare officer Simon Coombs tried to free the puss, but he was so tightly wedged in that he couldn't move him, and called Avon Fire and Rescue Service. Firefighters spent half an hour chiselling a breezeblock free from the neighbour's wall, revealing Marv's tail and back legs so Mr Coombs could pull him out backwards. Firefighters were then called and they were forced to chisel through the wall in order to free Marv, who was stuck . After creating a hole in the wall, Marv's tail and back legs were revealed and an RSPCA officer pulled him free . Marv the cat became stuck in a small gap in between two garages next to his owner's house in Hanham, Bristol . He said: 'We don't know how Marv got into the space, it may be that he fell into the gap and struggled to get free only to get himself well and truly stuck. 'As usual, we are immensely grateful to the fire and rescue service for their help, not to mention grateful to the neighbour, whose garage wall came off the worst in this incident! 'It was great to see Marv reunited with his family after this real team effort to free him.' While owner Mr Veale, a mortgage broker, added: 'My neighbour came round to tell me he thought the cat was stuck. 'He was crying out quite a bit and he was too far stuck down to get out, and also upside down, so he couldn't hold on to anything. He was eventually reunited with his owner's daughters Tilly and Bella and luckily he was uninjured .

"Television personality and author Bill Nye 'the Science Guy' joined President Barack Obama today for an Earth Day excursion, riding aboard Air Force One with the president during his visit to the Florida Everglades. Nye held court with press making the trip before boarding the airliner, telling them, I love the smell of jet fuel, according to an account provided to White House reporters. The White House said Tuesday that Nye, who has degrees in engineering but was made famous by his 90s era television show for school children, 'Bill Nye the Science Guy,' would make the trek today on its behalf to shoot a video of the president. On the road trip  from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to the Florida swamp and back again, a 1,836 mile flight, Nye will have ample opportunity to take a big whiff of the carbon being emitted from the president's jet as it burns up more than 9,180 gallons of fuel. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Television personality and author Bill Nye 'the Science Guy' joined President Barack Obama today for an Earth Day excursion, riding aboard Air Force One with the president during his visit to the Florida Everglades. Nye held court with press before boarding the airliner, telling them that he loves the smell of jet fuel . Global warming triumverate Barack Obama (center) Bill Nye (left) and Neil DeGrasse Tyson (right) shared a selfie moment in the Blue Room of the White House last year . Off to save the planet: Obama flew nearly 2,000 miles round-trip on Earth Day to the Florida Everglades and back . Nye told press it was his first time on the president's private jet, but he once rode AF2 with former Vice President Al Gore. And, while he was working as an engineer at Boeing in 1978, Nye said he designed an anti-vibration tube for the horizontal stabilizer that is used in the company's 747 planes, and likely AF1. In a tweet last night, Nye said he was 'heading down to DC to catch an #EarthDay flight on Air Force One with President Obama. 'We're going to '#ActonClimate,' he wrote. 'That said, the excitement, much like #climatechange, is real,' he added in a follow-up tweet a minute later. The statements were met with puzzled responses. 'Doesn't jet travel leave a big carbon footprint?' user Timothy Grome wrote. 'Hmm, seems ironic. doesn't seem very climate friendly earth day,' Allison B. of Galveston, Texas, said. White House communications director Jen Psaki got some 'cool points' today by posing for a selfie with Nye . Obama used the Earth Day trip to promote his administration's commitment to cutting carbon pollution and preserving Florida's wetlands, taking a tour of Everglades National Park and giving a speech that was first cancelled this morning for the public because of heavy showers, then rescheduled. 'I can’t think of a better way to spend Earth Day than in one of our nation’s greatest natural treasures, the Everglades,' he told his audience, calling the swamp, which he acknowledged is not technically a swamp, 'magical.' Asked on Monday if the president risks 'undermining' his message on greenhouse gases by adding to emissions with his own travel, Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said ,'no, he doesn't' and repeated the administration's talking points on the harmful effects of carbon pollution. 'That is precisely the case that the President will be making at the Everglades. And he’s looking forward to the trip,' Earnest concluded. He then directed the reporter, CBS News' Mark Knoller, to the Department of Defense and the Presidential Airlift Group for information on what the United States Air Force is doing to make the president's travel more environmentally friendly. The White House's official photographer, Pete Souza, posted this image to Instagram today with the following caption: 'It's @billnye (The Science Guy) on Marine One talking science on Earth Day with the President, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz' 'I can say as a general matter that the Department of Defense has acknowledged that climate change does pose a national security threat to the United States,' Earnest added. 'And there are a lot of practices that the Department of Defense has taken to try to reduce their carbon footprint.' Knoller, the unofficial historian of the modern White House, also frequently calculates how much fuel AF1 guzzles up – including during today's trip. Florida's Republican governor Rick Scott lit into Obama and Congress in anticipation of the president's visit. He accused them of not providing his state with what he believes to be appropriate financial resources to protect the Everglades . 'Our environment is too important to neglect and it’s time for the federal government to focus on real solutions and live up to their promises,' he said in a statement. Earnest mocked the GOP executive in comments to CBS DC and noted that Scott had 'outlawed employees in the State of Florida from even uttering the word ""climate change."" ' 'It’s a little rich for someone who has made that declaration that somehow the president has not been sufficiently committed to defending the Everglades from the causes of climate change,' he said.","Engineer-turned-science-TV-host told a White House pool reporter that he loves the smell of jet fuel .

"Philip Garrod, 43, was caught by a speed camera doing 105mph on his powerful Suzuki motorbike . A lying paramedic was struck off for faking a 999 emergency call-out to try and get off a driving ban after being caught speeding at 105mph on his motorbike. Philip Garrod, 43, was on his way to start a shift with the Welsh Ambulance Service when he was caught by a police camera doing the the eye-watering speed in a 60mph zone on his powerful Suzuki motorbike. He pleaded guilty and was fined £650 with six points for speeding  but then began weaving a web of lies after asking the judge to consider special circumstances to try and avoid a driving ban. At Dolgellau Magistrates Court, Garrod had claimed he was rushing to work after a colleague had contacted him before he set off and told him that a cyclist was injured on the A470 at Dolgellau in north Wales. But the judge ordered an adjournment to take various witness statements before making a decision on his driving ban. That's when bosses began their own investigations and discovered the extent of Garrod's lies and opened a special misconduct hearing. Yesterday, the disciplinary hearing was told Garrod filled in a 'patient clinical record' for the bogus call to back up his false story. Garrod - a paramedic for ten years - was caught out when ambulance chiefs checked to find no record of the 999 call on the day of his speeding ticket. The panel heard the ambulance trust had no records of any 999 alert on the A470 at Dolgellau, North Wales, on 25 April 2011 - the day he was caught speeding. A report from the Health and Care Professionals Council said: 'The conduct was deliberate and was designed to mitigate the fact that he had been caught speeding. 'His actions were pre-meditated as he went as far as falsifying documentation to support his story. 'This would be deemed to be dishonest by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people.' Garrod claimed he was rushing to work after a colleague had contacted him before he set off and told him that a cyclist was injured on the A470 at Dolgellau but was caught out when bosses checked 999 records . Father-of-two Garrod did not attend the disciplinary hearing in Cardiff but said in writing he had 'confused the dates'. Garrod denied five allegations relating to providing false statements, creating a false patient clinic record and dishonesty. But he was struck off after being found guilty of misconduct. The disciplinary hearing ruled: 'Such conduct by a health professional falls well below the standards expected of a registered health professional and consequently amounts to misconduct.'","Philip Garrod caught while on way to work with Welsh Ambulance Service .

"Colin Hendry appears at Blackpool Magistrates' Court where he admitted a drink driving charge . Former Scotland captain Colin Hendry has been banned from driving after he was caught drunk at the wheel of his Ford Focus. Hendry, 49, rowed with his then girlfriend Sarah Kinder before embarking on a drinking session which led to him driving through Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, where he was seen speeding, a court heard. Police followed his 10-year-old car as it crossed double white lines while the father-of-four attempted to drive home. Now the former Premier League player who had spells with Blackburn Rovers and Manchester City, must travel around on his bike, a court heard. Hendry of  Lytham St Annes, admitted drink driving on the town's Church Road on February 21. He was almost twice over the legal limit after drinking in a Lytham cocktail bar. His lawyer Gwyn Lewis told Blackpool Magistrates' Court that Hendry's current income was 'meagre' and he asked for extra time for his client to pay fines and costs until he can start taking his offshore pension in mid May. Mr Lewis said Hendry, who is out of work, no longer wished to pursue a defence of 'special reasons' as a forensic report revealed he would have been over the limit at the time he was breath tested and there was no evidence that his drinks had been spiked. Peter Bardsley, prosecuting, said that a police officer in an unmarked car saw Hendry at 1am pulling away from a junction at speed. He followed Hendry who drove above a 20mph limit and then a 30mph limit sometimes going as fast as 50mph. The officer ordered Hendry's car to stop and smelled alcohol on him. He was arrested and a breath test revealed 63 microgrammes of alcohol in his breath. The legal limit is 35. The court heard Hendy, who played for Blackburn Rover and Manchester City, was seen driving at up to 50mph while drunk after a row with his then girlfriend Sarah Kinder . Argument: Hendry said he had rowed with Sarah Kinder, pictured. He has subsequently been arrested for allegedly breaking a restraining order . Mr Lewis said: 'Mr Hendry is a fit man and regularly cycles. He has not drunk for seven weeks before he was arrested. Playing career: Hendry captained Scotland and played for Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, and Rangers . 'He started what some people call a dry January following the death of his wife in 2009.' 'However he was in an emotional state that day-and he decided to take a drink. However he knows what he drank and still cannot accept the reading from the breath test.' 'His finances are to say the least complicated. He was made bankrupt some years ago. His income is meagre until he can start taking his pension in mid-May.' Chair of the Bench Marilyn Padgett banned Hendry for 17 months. He was also offered a drink drivers' rehabilitation scheme which will reduce his ban by one third if he completes it. He was fined £110 and the magistrate said: 'We have based this on the lowest level and it will be deferred for six weeks to allow you to start your pension.' He was ordered to pay £200 court costs and £20 victims' surcharge. In 2010, Hendry was made bankrupt owing £2.2m to friends, family and the taxman. Last weekend he was arrested after allegedly breaking a restraining order which forbids him from contacting his beauty technician former girlfriend Ms Kinder.

"The general in charge of the U.S. Army Recruiting Command has warned that America’s growing obesity epidemic ‘is becoming a national security issue.’ Major General Allen Batschelet says that 10 percent of young men and women who sign up to join the Army are currently refused because they are too heavy. Batschelet warns that current trends mean as many as half of young Americans will be so grossly overweight by the end of the decade that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. Scroll down for video . As many as half of young Americans will be so grossly overweight by the end of the decade that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. Major General Allen Batschelet says that 10 percent of young men and women who sign up to join the Army are currently refused because they are too heavy . 'The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,' he told CNN. 'We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50 percent, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army. It's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.' Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country in 2014, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because they had a criminal background, too many tattoos or a lack of education - but 10 percent didn't qualify because they were overweight. According to the CDC, 81 percent of overweight boys and 71 percent of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. Army recruiters, facing overweight prospective soldiers who are eager to sign up, have become fitness coaches - much like the trainers on NBC's The Biggest Loser. Boot camp: The maximum body fat percentage that the army allows for recruits aged 17-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for females . The recruiters will spend time educating the hopefuls on diet and exercise and encourage them to lose the pounds necessary to qualify for boot camp. Many still fail to make the grade, but some do - such as a female recruit from Kansas who lost 80 pounds in a year so that she could sign up. 'We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,' said Batschelet. 'We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.' The maximum body fat percentage that the Army allows for recruits aged 17-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for females. The maximum a female soldier, aged 17-20, can weigh is 227 pounds, while the maximum for a male soldier in the same age group is 234 pounds and in both instances that is dependent on being 80 inches tall. Obesity rates have tripled in a generation with more than one-third of U.S. adults now considered obese, while 17 percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese. Army recruiters are having to act like the trainers on NBC's The Biggest Loser (ex-trainer Jillian Michaels pictured above) when they met prospective soldiers who are eager to sign up but are too fat to fight .","General in charge of US Army recruiting has warned that America's growing obesity epidemic 'is becoming a national security issue'

"It is a well-known fact that the technology industry is mostly dominated by men, but now, thanks to a new blog by a young female computing student, women in tech have finally been given a platform through which their amazing achievements are being recognized. Stanford computer science student Lea Coligado, 21, created Women of Silicon Valley, a blog based on the people-profiling website Humans of New York,in order to showcase the talents and stories of tech's best and brightest women working within the industry. 'Over the past couple years, I've come into contact with some awesome women in tech through Stanford or work, and I kept thinking to myself, why have I never heard of them before?' Lea told BuzzFeed. Girls on top: Stanford computer science student Lea Coligado features talented women in the tech industry, such as Postmates exec Sara Mauskopf, on her blog Women of Silicon Valley . Relatable: Many of the subjects featured on the blog talk on subjects that many women in the industry will have had to deal with . Looking up: The blog has attracted attention from the best in the business, including women-in-tech advocate Tracy Chou, a software engineer at Pinterest . The blog, like the one that inspired it, features photos and stories of subjects in the industry, often accompanying them with inspirational quotes. In the description for the blog, Lea says that the goal of the project is 'to celebrate these living - and thriving - examples of female success, these rebels against the numbers and the gender norms.' In her 'Letter from the Editor', Lea also describes how an internship she completed at Facebook was viewed as a 'give away' by one of her classmates – who suggested that anyone would be able to secure one of the highly sought-after positions if a woman had been offered one, despite applauding a male friend for being given the very same job. She recounts other moments of horrific sexism she has experienced while working in various offices - from shameless come-ons from married colleagues to blanket, patronizing statements of 'women don't code' told directly to her by colleagues. The brains behind it all: Lea Coligado, 21, created the blog after experiencing the bias against women in the industry first-hand . Underrepresented: The Women in Silicon Valley blog aims 'to celebrate these living - and thriving - examples of female success, these rebels against the numbers and the gender norms' Quotables: The women featured on the blog open up about their own experiences of subtle - and less subtle - sexism in the office . It was after such experiences that, Lea says, she realized the importance of having idols in the industry. Speaking in more detail to Buzzfeed, she added: 'As a woman who's worked in almost entirely male environments, I know being able to look up to someone is crucial for getting through rough patches, for feeling a sense of belonging to your work.' The idea has already attracted some big names, including some of the most vocal advocates for women in tech like Tracy Chou, who joined social media giant Pinterest, where she still works as a software engineer, back when it was still a start-up. Tracy herself has also made strides in bringing awareness to the gender disparity in tech. Inspired: The blog's goal is to is to inspire women to continue on in computer sciences, because it is more possible to succeed than some may think . All together: The blog encourages women to be proud of their own achievements and encourage others in similar circumstances . In a blog post last year on Medium the engineer wrote: 'The actual numbers I’ve seen and experienced in industry are far lower than anybody is willing to admit. This means nobody is having honest conversations about the issue.' With that in mind, Tracy created a GitHub spreadsheet in which tech companies could reveal their demographics to world, and over 200 companies have self-reported on their diversity since. But the numbers don't look good when it comes to some of the world’s most well-known tech companies. Dropbox records that only 26 of its 275 software engineering employees are female, while Etsy records 19 of 149 and GitHub shows only 10 out of 160. In her quest to raise awareness, and with names like Tracy's in her corner, Lea is hoping to one day feature the likes of Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, Marissa Mayer, and Laura Weidman Powers, the CEO and co-founder of  non-profit tech-focused organisation CODE2040. 'I want women who are sitting on the fence about Computer Science to get as inspired as I was by these role models,' Lea told Buzzfeed. 'And hopefully, to see that at its heart tech is exciting, immensely powerful and so, so worth it.'","Lea Coligado, 21, a Stanford computer science student, is the creator of the blog showcasing talented women in tech .

"A controversial anti-vaccination organisation has come under fire for comparing compulsory vaccination to rape in a social media post. The Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network, an anti-vaccinations lobby group, posted an image to their Facebook page on Thursday which shows a man holding a woman with his hand over her mouth in an aggressive silencing gesture. The tag line on the image read, 'Forced penetration. Really- no big deal, if it's just a vaccination needle and he's a doctor. Do you really ""need"" control over over your own choices?'. The Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network has come under fire for comparing vaccinations to rape . The image was posted in response to tough new laws announced by Social Services Minister Scott Morrison earlier in April, which means that parents will no longer be able to access childcare benefits simply by signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on 'personal, philosophical or religious' reasons. However, a president of the Australian Vaccination-skeptics Network said the message had nothing to do with the group. 'I can state categorically that The Australian Vaccination-skeptics Network Inc does not support or agree with the sentiments or messages portrayed in the picture,' she said. 'We do not own the page it was posted on.' 'What the Australian Vaccination-skeptics Network does support and believe in, is the right of ALL parents to make an informed choice in regards to vaccinating their children, whether they vaccinate, selectively vaccinate or do not vaccinate at all,' she said. 'We are pro-choice, pro-information and pro-parental rights. The new federal law, which was in part prompted by the death of one-month-old Riley Hughes from complications arising from whooping cough, means that parents who refuse to immunise their children are set to lose up to $15,000 a year for every child when the changes come into force from January 1, 2016. The post, which has since been removed, caused an instant outcry from followers and opponents of the group alike, with social media users labelling the post 'tasteless', 'disgusting', and a possible trigger for those who had suffered sexual assault. 'Dear rape victims, according to the rabid anti-vaxxers what you went thru is no worse than. Shame,' said one social media user. 'Are you saying that your child being immunised is as bad as your child being raped? This could also be very triggering for victims of sexual assault,' said another. The administrator of the page defended the post, maintaining that is wasn't tasteless, but honest. 'What truly is tasteless is our elected government trying to tell us that we have to vaccinate our children even if we don’t believe it is best for their health,' the administrator wrote. 'That is tasteless. And if you find this post confronting – imagine how you would feel if you were a parent who was being told that they were going to have to vaccinate their children or starve.' Fiona McCormack, the CEO of Domestic Violence Victoria said the comparison was 'so irresponsible and inappropriate'. Social media users labelling the post 'tasteless', 'disgusting', and a possible trigger for those who had suffered sexual assault . The image was posted in response to tough new 'no jab, no pay' laws which was announced by Social Services Minister Scott Morrison earlier in April . 'To compare a doctor injecting a child against something like the measles to rape … it's obscene,' Ms McCormack told The Age. On Wednesday, a post to the page said that the controversial post was made by someone independent to the organisation. 'As written in the about section, the AVN has not owned this Facebook page for some time. This page is open to the public. We sincerely apologise for an earlier post that caused offense to many, including supporters. We are still investigating and have taken your comments on board,' the post said. The Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network has previously used the metaphor of rape to oppose vaccinations, when reports of a child being given a court order to be immunised was labelled by the group as 'court ordered rape'. 'Think this is an exaggeration? Think again. This is assault without consent and with full penetration too,' the post said. 'If you were the doctor ordered to administer this vaccine and the mother was standing there, holding her child under a court order while you prepared the shot and she was begging you to stop and crying that it would hurt and you continued to do it anyway - how different is that from rape?' the administrator later commented on the post. The Network has previously come under fire when it was stripped of its registered charity status last year. The Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network has previously used the metaphor of rape to oppose vaccinations . 'Think this is an exaggeration? Think again. This is assault without consent and with full penetration too,' the post said . New South Wales Fair Trading Minister Stuart Ayres demanded that the group surrender i''ts authority to fundraise, which it has done, under the Charitable Fundraising Act,' he said. 'An investigation has highlighted a number of potential concerns,' he told The ABC. Mr Ayres said that the NSW Government had been collecting information as to the accuracy of facts provided by the group about the dangers of immunisation. 'We will continue to monitor the information that they put on their website. We will continue to ensure that they present themselves as an anti-vaccination advocacy. That's entirely up to them to do that. We want to make sure that they don't ever promote misleading information.' The Health Care Complaints Commission released a statement in relation to the AVN last year, which contained a warning for members of the public when considering the information the lobby group posted on their website. 'AVN does not provide reliable information in relation to certain vaccines and vaccination more generally,' the statement said. 'The Commission considers that AVN’s dissemination of misleading, misrepresented and incorrect information about vaccination engenders fear and alarm and is likely to detrimentally affect the clinical management or care of its readers.' The tough new vaccination law was in part prompted by the death of one-month-old Riley Hughes from complications arising from whooping cough . On Wednesday, a post to the page said that the controversial post was made by someone independent to the organisation . In December 2012, the New South Wales Department of Fair Trading ordered the Australian Vaccination Network (AVN)- which Ms Dorey was then president of - to change its name or risk being shut down. The move followed 'numerous' complaints from both the public and the Australian Medical Association that the AVN name was misleading the public and wasn’t an accurate representation of its activities. The AVN claims to be pro-choice and a 'vaccine safety watchdog' However, t-shirts on the group's website seemed to promote more fierce objectives which rule out vaccinating children at all. One top featured the slogan: 'Love Them, Protect Them, Never Inject Them'.","A statement claiming to be from an anti-vaccination lobby group has compared immunisation to rape .

"A teenager set herself on fire after allegedly being raped by five men from her village in India – and her family reportedly told her to keep quiet about the attack. The 14-year-old is now fighting for her life in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital with 70 per cent burns. She was allegedly gang-raped on Sunday when she went outside her house in Kosi Kalan, in Uttar Pradesh's Mathura district, to relieve herself. Scroll down for video . A teenager set herself on fire after allegedly being raped by five men from her village in India. She is now recovering in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital (pictured) She was allegedly gang-raped on Sunday when she went outside her house in Kosi Kalan, in Uttar Pradesh's Mathura district, to relieve herself (file image) On Tuesday she set herself on fire using kerosene, according to NDTV, to the shock of her brother, who doused her with water. He told the broadcaster: ‘When I woke up, I saw her in flames... I poured water on her to put out the flames.’ The girl was screaming for help, according to a neighbour. The accused men have been arrested. There is a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India at the moment after officials last month banned India's Daughter, a documentary about the gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Recent attacks in India have resulted in street protests with many calling for more protection for women . Officials said the documentary would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Last month an angry mob were seen on video footage beating a man to death in the street who was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl. Video footage has emerged of the brutal prolonged attack on the 18-year-old, which was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd in Nagaland in eastern India. Ibo Cha was said to have been beaten for an hour before he died of his injuries. The footage was shot in September last year after the girl's body was found in woodland, enraging locals. But it only came to light after earlier this year alleged rapist Syed Sarif Khan was kidnapped from prison and dragged through the streets of the same area. He was then stripped naked and beaten to death. He was accused but not convicted of raping a 19-year-old female student multiple times. Later Nagaland Government said he was innocent. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. A minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators.

Plans for a 'rainbow' zebra crossing to support gay rights in Totnes, Devon, could be abandoned amid fears it would cause hallucinations for dementia sufferers . The brightly coloured crossing was due to be installed in Totnes in Devon - the first in Europe - as a mark of the town's pride for its gay community . Fears were expressed to councillors who had been asked to back the plan to install the crossing across an area called The Plains. Councillors told the Proud2Be group, which has launched the campaign, to go away and seek further medical advice from experts. Totnes town councillor Carol Wellwood said: 'Somebody who works with the elderly is concerned that people with Alzheimer's might find a rainbow crossing very troubling. 'The claim is that it would cause them to have hallucinations.' Mat Price, who runs the the Proud2Be group revealed that a trained dementia champion had contacted the group warning of the serious health impact. But he said: 'I don't understand why it is any different from putting a rainbow-coloured display in a shop window or Christmas lights up at Christmas.

There have been temporary crossings in London and Brighton but the one planned in Totnes is hoped to be the first permanent one in Europe. The estimated cost of £15,000 to set it up would be found through an international fund raising campaign, grant funding and commercial high-profile sponsorship. It was temporarily installed to mark Pride celebrations last year. The crossing was removed but gay rights project Proud2Be has been fighting to create a permanent version ever since. Mr Price, who set up Proud2Be with his twin brother, said that he hoped the crossing would send a strong and positive message. Mat, 32, said: 'Totnes is a brave and courageous town, which likes to do things first. We want to celebrate diversity and encourage people to be proud of who they are.' His brother and co-founder Jon Price, 32, said: 'Growing up in a rural community as LGBT, I know how important it is to feel supported as it is easy to be isolated. 'The rainbow crossing is a great way to increase the visibility and awareness around these issues. This has brought the community together to do something positive.'","The brightly coloured crossing was due to be installed in Totnes in Devon .

"The IRS' overloaded phone system hung up on more than eight million taxpayers this filing season as the agency cut millions of dollars from customer services. For those who weren't disconnected, only 40percent actually got through to a person. Many of those people had to wait on hold for more than 30 minutes, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said Wednesday. Dead line: The IRS' overloaded phone system hung up on more than 8 million taxpayers this filing season as the agency cut millions of dollars from taxpayer services . A new staff report by Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee says the IRS diverted millions from taxpayer services and other areas to pay for President Barack Obama's health law. At a hearing Wednesday, Koskinen blamed budget cuts approved by Congress. The agency's budget has been cut by $1.2 billion since 2010. 'Customer service, both on the phone and in person has been much far worse than anyone would want,' Koskinen told a Ways and Means subcommittee. Speaking out: Many of those people had to wait on hold for more than 30 minutes, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said Wednesday (pictured above) 'It's simply a matter of not having enough people to answer the phones and provide service at our walk-in sites as a result of cuts to our budget.' Koskinen said the agency is required by law to implement the health law, leaving him with few other places to cut. He said the agency requested a total of $600 million over the past two years for computer upgrades to implement the health law as well as a new law requiring foreign banks to report information about U.S. account holders. 'In both years the Congress gave us zero dollars so we had no choice but to look elsewhere,' Koskinen said.","For those who weren't disconnected, only 40percent actually got through .

"Yet another scientific study has found no link between autism and the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) - even among high risk children. The findings, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), are based on a study of about 95,000 young people. All those in the study had older siblings. Some of the elder children had autism and some did not. Numerous studies over the last 15 years have ruled out a link between the MMR vaccine and autism . Since autism can run in families, researchers decided to look at whether vaccines could make autism even more likely in children who had siblings with autism. They found that vaccines had no effect on autism risk, whether or not a sibling in the family was diagnosed. 'Consistent with studies in other populations, we observed no association between MMR vaccination and increased ASD risk among privately insured children,' said the study, led by Anjali Jain, a doctor in Falls Church, Virginia. 'We also found no evidence that receipt of either one or two doses of MMR vaccination was associated with an increased risk of ASD among children who had older siblings with ASD.' Autism is on the rise, and affects as many as one in 68 children in the United States, but its causes remain poorly understood. Fears about vaccines and autism began to spread after the publication in 1998 of an article by Andrew Wakefield. He was later stripped of his medical license . Fears about vaccines and autism began to spread after the publication in 1998 of an article by Andrew Wakefield that purported to find a link between the MMR vaccine and autism in 12 children. It was later found to be fraudulent and was retracted by the journal that published it. As the author, Wakefield was stripped of his medical license. But concerns over vaccine safety, particularly in the Internet age, have proven difficult to quell. 'Although a substantial body of research over the last 15 years has found no link between the MMR vaccine and ASD, parents and others continue to associate the vaccine with ASD,' said the JAMA study. 'Surveys of parents who have children with ASD suggest that many believe the MMR vaccine was a contributing cause.' Children who have an older sibling with autism are less likely to get vaccinated, the study found. The MMR vaccination rate for the children with unaffected siblings was 92 percent by age five. In contrast, the MMR vaccination rates for children with older siblings with ASD was 86 percent by age five. An accompanying editorial by Bryan King, a doctor at the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital, said the data is clear. 'The only conclusion that can be drawn from the study is that there is no signal to suggest a relationship between MMR and the development of autism in children with or without a sibling who has autism,' King wrote. 'Taken together, some dozen studies have now shown that the age of onset of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, the severity or course of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, and now the risk of ASD recurrence in families does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children.'","The findings, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, are based on a study of about 95,000 young people .

"Five nursing students tragically died early on Wednesday in a chain-reaction crash in southeast Georgia that authorities said began when a tractor-trailer failed to slow down and smashed into stop-and-go traffic. Those killed were traveling on Interstate 16 near Savannah in two passenger vehicles mangled by the crash. The tractor-trailer plowed into an SUV, then rolled over a small passenger car that burst into flames, said Sgt. 1st Class Chris Nease of the Georgia State Patrol. The big truck came to a halt after slamming into the back of a tanker. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: A Georgia state trooper works the scene of a deadly crash in which five nursing students from Georgia Southern University died Wednesday morning . Victims: Abbie Deloach (left), of Savannah, and Emily Clark, of Powder Springs, (right) were among the five young women killed in the horrific crash . Sad: Caitlynn Baggett (left), of Millen, and Catherine McKay Pittman, of Alpharetta, (right) were also killed . Terrible loss: Leesburg woman Morgan Bass was also killed in the horrific crash . All five of the dead were nursing students at Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, about 30 miles from the crash site. St. Joseph's/ Candler Health System said the students were commuting to St. Joseph's Hospital in Savannah for their last day of clinical training of the school year. 'The loss of any student, especially in a tragic way, is particularly painful,' Brooks Keel, president of Georgia Southern, said in a statement. 'Losing five students is almost incomprehensible.' The Georgia State Patrol said three people also were injured and seven vehicles were damaged. The crash occurred at about 6 a.m. in Bryan County, about 20 miles west of Savannah. Traffic was heavy at that hour because an unrelated wreck about a mile ahead that forced motorists to slow, Nease said. 'Traffic was sort of stop-and-go when the tractor-trailer came along and struck one of the passenger vehicles in the rear,' Nease said. 'We're still trying to piece it all together. It's a terrible day.' The university said the students were all Georgia residents in their junior year - Emily Clark of Powder Springs, Morgan Bass of Leesburg, Abbie Deloach of Savannah, Catherine Pittman of Alpharetta and Caitlyn Baggett of Millen. Ages weren't given. Hospital officials said they were wrapping up clinical training for the year. Mangled: The five women, all of them juniors, were driving separately in two vehicles that were both mangled in the accident . Terrible accident: The Georgia State Patrol said three people also were injured and seven vehicles were damaged . 'You could tell they really loved what they did,' Sherry Danello, the hospital's chief nursing officer, said in a statement. 'They didn't just go through the task, they really connected to the patients.' The crash halted some motorists for more than six hours as road crews and tow trucks cleared the wreckage. Even when traffic began moving again, troopers kept a 6-mile stretch of eastbound I-16 closed as they investigated. Nease said the driver of the tractor-trailer had not been cited as investigators worked to determine exactly what happened. The driver's name was not immediately released. State troopers said weather didn't seem to be a factor. 'There was no fog or smoke. It was clear as a bell,' said Sgt. Chris Rodewolt of the State Patrol. 'We did have heavy, heavy traffic.' Two mangled passenger vehicles rested Wednesday at the bottom of an embankment beside the interstate. In front of them, just off the highway, was a tractor-trailer with its cab smashed into the back of a tanker truck. It is with a heavy heart that I inform you of a tragedy that took place this morning. Several Georgia Southern students died and two were injured in an early morning crash on I-16 eastbound near Savannah. We are unable to release the names of these students at this time because we are awaiting notification to families. Every one of our students contributes in no small measure, to the Eagle Nation. The loss of any student, especially in a tragic way, is particularly painful. Losing five students is almost incomprehensible. Our hearts go out to the families, friends and classmates of these students. The University flag will fly at half-staff Thursday in their memory. Memorial arrangements are pending. Let me urge those particularly touched by this tragedy to avail themselves of counseling services, and I urge all members of the University community to support each other during this time.

"In a retweet on Thursday, a staffer to real estate magnate Donald Trump managed to capture the coarsest background conversations Americans are having about former secretary of state Hillary Clinton's personal baggage. He may now be looking for a new job. 'If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband,' a Texas-cowgirl college student tweeted, 'what makes her think she can satisfy America?' When someone retweeted the quip two hours later and included Trump's Twitter handle in the message, one of the billionaire's staffers retweeted it for him – to his audience of 2.8 million people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . THE INTERNET IS FOREVER: A social media staffer to Donald Trump retweeted an off-color jab at Hillary Clinton on Thursday before the boss deleted it . Trump, a multibillionaire who's considering a presidential run, will be in New Hampshire on Saturday – where the episode will likely come up . SATISFIED? Bill Clinton (left) was a famous lothario during his presidency, even carrying on one affair with a White House intern . Time elapsed: Less than three hours. His office confirmed on Friday that it was a Trump employee, not a fat-fingered CEO, who was responsible. 'Mr. Trump was not responsible for this tweet,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Online. 'It was retweeted by one of ten staff members that periodically help execute on Mr. Trump’s various social media platforms.' 'As soon as Mr. Trump saw the tweet he deleted it,' the spokesperson added. Hillary Clinton's once-strained relationship with her philandering husband isn't likely to be the stuff of TV ads in the 2016 presidential race, but the tweet suggests an undercurrent of crude jokes are being made at her expense. Sawyer Burmeister, a Texas equestrian champion, originated the line about Hillary Clinton's alleged inability to 'satisfy' her randy husband Bill . Bill Clinton, the 42nd U.S. president, had an affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. He also famously caroused with other women who were not his wife, going back to his days as the governor of Arkansas. A recent book about the staff who run the White House residence recounted a butler's story about hearing HIllary throw an object at him during the height of the Lewinsky saga. Taylor Burmeister, who wrote the tweet about Hillary failing to satisfy Bill, deleted it just before noon on Friday, along with a second message. 'Sry to those offended by me merely making a political joke,' she had tweeted in a follow-up. 'Get some rest, there are more important things in the world to be worried about.' She assured Daily Mail Online in an email that no one fro, the Trump camp had asked her to delete the tweets. 'I deleted them by choice because of the negative backlash I was receiving,' she said. 'I didn't even know Donald Trump had retweeted it until about an hour ago.' Burmeister confirmed to Daily Mail Online that she had deleted her tweets because of a nasty backlash . She originally offered an apology to people who were offended, but it apparently wasn't enough for some . Burmeister is no stranger to media attention. A world champion equestrian, she also had a bit part last year in an episode of the reboot of the 'Dallas' TV drama. And she's a pre-law student studying criminal justice at Tarleton State University in Texas, according to her social media profiles. Trump's retweet might have disappeared if a snarky Twitter user hadn't made a screen capture on his phone. 'Hey @RealDonaldTrump – In case you're looking for that tweet you deleted,' he wrote, 'I got it right here.'

"This is the heart-rending moment a teenage boy learnt that he could be adopted by his caseworker two years after making a desperate plea for a family. Davion Navar Henry Only, 16, had spent his entire life in foster care after his mother gave birth to him behind bars. In 2013 he stood before his Florida church to beg for someone to adopt him, and now he has a permanent home with the woman who first met him as a seven-year-old when she became his caseworker. Scroll down for video . Emotion gets the better of him: 'Thank you all for being my family,' Davion (above) said during the adoption proceedings . Finally found his forever home: Davion Only was formally adopted by his former caseworker Connie Going (above) on Wednesday . End of a long road; 'I've always loved him, the same as my other children. My commitment to him is for his whole life,' said Going of Davion (above with Going's daughter Carly) Throughout Davion's search for a family, and his years in the system, Connie Bell Going, had been by his side - and on Wednesday she officially became his mother. 'This is a special day for a lot of people. This room is a testament to all the lives you have touched,' Judge Raymond Gross told Davion in a Clearwater courtroom Wednesday according to the Tampa Bay Times. 'Not just your new mom and siblings, but so many, many people. When you were given a bad hand, you didn't accept it. You stood up and said, ""I'm worthy. I want you to hear me."" You've waited a long time for this day.' When asked why she wanted to adopt the teenager, Connie put her hand on Davion's shoulder and said: 'I've always loved him, the same as my other children. My commitment to him is for his whole life.' A number of people were said to be in tears in the courtroom. Before coming to his decision the judge had asked Connie's daughters if they agreed to the adoption, to which her eldest, 17-year-old Carly, replied 'it feels right'. Going said of Davion; 'When it was Davion's turn to speak he remained silent, but did say at the end of the process; 'Thank you all for being my family.' Firm family bond: Davion, 16, who captured hearts in 2013 when he made a plea for a family to 'love him forever' Davion plays on the Xbox in his bedroom with his  mom Connie sitting behind him together with her daughter Carly, 17, and her adopted son, Taylor, 14 . Going has admitted that it has not always easy integrating him into her existing family, but she said it was worth it. Since August, Davion has been spending weekends with Connie and her daughters, Sydney, 21, Carley, 17, and with her adopted son Taylor, who is now 14. Then in December, Going took the steps to begin the adoption process and Davion moved with the rest of the family into a larger home. Since then there have fights and tables have been flipped, but in the end everyone loves one another, and she is prepared for the challenges. 'I'm okay with messy and difficult,' she told the Tampa Bay Times. 'You just have to have your armor on all the time, but it's more than worth it. And every day things get a little bit better.' Davion became an example of the struggle faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up and told worshipers at his church: 'My name is Davion and I've been in foster care since I was born. I know God hasn't given up on me, so I'm not giving up either.' He then said: 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be.' Davion Only, 16, has been adopted by his old case worker, Connie Bell Going in Florida (above). She has known the teen since he was seven years old. Davion had been in the foster care system his entire life . Davion (above) captured hearts  in 2013 when he made a plea in front of a St Petersburg church congregation for a family to 'love him forever' Most of all, Davion said he just wanted a family that would 'love him forever'. Millions of people around the country soon heard about Davion's story, and the young boy was even interviewed by Barbara Walters on The View, which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in Ohio and his family. That is until Davion got into a fight with one of the other children, and the minister sent him back to Florida, and back to live in the foster care system. After Davion returned, people kept asking Going what it was that went wrong and caused him to be sent back after just three months. 'That boy spent his whole life in the system, that's what went wrong,' she said. Making matters worse, Davion and Miss Connie, as he calls her, did not speak when he came back to Florida. Davion had cut himself off from other people, playing video games as he quickly went through four different homes and four schools in less than year. Davion Only (pictured above with Connie Going at the church where he made his speech in 2013) was adopted by a minister in Ohio but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister's children . Going says she had begun to call him numerous times, but he always hung up the phone. Then, one night last July, Davion called up Miss Connie and asked her the question he had been asking since they first met when he was only a little boy. 'Do you remember what I asked you before?' he said. 'Well, how do you feel about adopting me now?' For the first time since he had asked, Going was finally able to give him the answer he wanted to hear. The 52-year-old case worker has three children of her own, one adopted and two biological daughters, and was a single mother, but she was no longer Davion's case worker, which made the process easier. From August through December he started spending more and more time with the family, a perfect fit as he was already close to Going's adopted son Taylor. Then, in December, Going got a lawyer and began the process of adopting Davion. Davion Only (pictured above in church three years ago) called and asked Miss Connie if she would adopt him last July . Davion got his first bedroom, his first set of siblings, and, most importantly, the one thing he had been hoping for all along. 'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion said to Going last December. 'Only now I get to call you that for real, right?' Davion officially became part of the family in February however, when after he and Going celebrated their birthdays, which fall on the same date, they went home and sat around the table for cake with his three siblings and signed the court papers. After 16 years Davion was finally home. What's more, because of that day in September 2013 when Davion stepped up on the pulpit, hundreds of others have been adopted as well. 'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion (above in 2013) said to Going last December .","Davion Only won US hearts in 2013 with plea for family to 'love him forever'

"A controversial pro-Israel advocacy group known for publicly criticizing Islam can display its political advertisement containing the phrase 'Killing Jews is Worship' on New York City's buses, a judge ruled this week. Judge John Koeltl said in a decision made public Tuesday that the incendiary ad is speech protected under the First Amendment. He said he was sensitive to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's claim that the poster could incite violence and appreciates the efforts necessary to prevent violent attacks targeting Jewish people. AFDI 1, MTA 0: A federal judge has ordered the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to run on its buses anti-Islam ads featuring the phrase 'Killing Jews is Worship' created by the pro-Israel lobby American Freedom Defense Initiative . But he noted that substantially the same advertisement ran in San Francisco and Chicago in 2013 without incident. He added that examples of violent attacks cited by the MTA show that individuals may commit heinous acts without warning. Koeltl also noted that the MTA and Chairman Thomas Prendergast 'underestimate the tolerant quality of New Yorkers and overestimate the potential impact of these fleeting advertisements.' 'Under the First Amendment, the fear of such spontaneous attacks, without more, cannot override individuals' rights to freedom of expression,' Koeltl said in a ruling dated Monday. He delayed enforcing his order to run the ads by a month so it can be appealed. MTA spokesman Adam Lisberg said the agency is disappointed in the ruling and is preparing a response. It came in a lawsuit filed last year by the American Freedom Defense Initiative, an organization headed by firebrand blogger Pamela Geller that's behind the advertisement. David Yerushalmi, a lawyer for the organization, said the decision 'sends a strong message both to government bureaucrats who would restrict our freedom of speech based upon what they perceive to be a global jihadist threat, and it also sends a telling message to our enemies abroad and at home: Their threats of violence will not prevent the courts from upholding the First Amendment.' The lawsuit said Geller's group buys the advertisements to express its message on current events and public issues 'including issues such as Islam's hatred of Jews.' An ad from the pro-Israel American Freedom Defense Initiative is seen on an articulated Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) bus featuring a 1941 photograph of Hitler and supporter Hajj Amin al-Husseini, a Palestinian Arab nationalist, Wednesday, April 1, 2015, in Philadelphia . The lawsuit was filed after the MTA notified the group in August that it would display three of four proposed posters but not an ad with the quote 'Killing Jews is Worship that draws us close to Allah' because it could incite violence. In the ad, a man's menacing face wrapped with a checkered scarf is shown next to the quote, which is attributed to ""Hamas MTV."" It is followed by the words: 'That's his Jihad. What's yours?' It also includes a disclaimer that the ad's display does not imply the MTA's endorsement of its views. The MTA, whose buses and subways have been forums for policy debates, has accepted other ads from the American Freedom Defense Initiative. In September 2012, subway stations in New York featured AFDI posters that read: 'In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad.' Two years later, Pamela Geller's group agreed to pull an ad from the subway system showing captive journalist James Foley with the masked militant who decapitated him in the moment before the beheading. In a September statement, the MTA said it recognized that the 'Killing Jews' ad was a parody of 'MyJihad' ads sponsored by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which said it was promoting the concept that jihad is an individual and personal struggle rather than a violent conflict or terrorism. Koeltl said he recognized that the MTA believes it would be far more difficult to counter the advertisement because it has parodic aspects. Past ads: A man stands next to ad in the New York Subway saying: 'In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad' in New York on September 24, 2012 . But he said he believes the agency underestimates 'the power of counter-advertisements to explain that the MTA does not endorse the ad and that the ad is not to be taken seriously.' Monica Klein, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, noted in a statement that the mayor has said 'these anti-Islamic ads are outrageous, inflammatory and wrong, and have no place in New York City, or anywhere.' 'These hateful messages serve only to divide and stigmatize when we should be coming together as one city,' she added. 'While those behind these ads only display their irresponsible intolerance, the rest of us who may be forced to view them can take comfort in the knowledge that we share a better, loftier and nobler view of humanity.'

"A gang of six men have been jailed for a total of 31 years after being convicted of a string of sexual offences against teenager girls. The offences, which ranged from inciting sexual activity with a child, to rape, happened in cars, woods or at the defendants' homes in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Oxford Crown Court heard how they lured victims to parties organised on social media and then began sexually abusing them. The men were found guilty in March and have now been handed sentences of between three and nine years in jail. Jailed: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21 (left) was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, (right) was imprisoned for four years and nine months . The girls, aged between 13 and 16, were targeted by the gang  at under-18s parties organised by Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, known as 'Fiddy'. One child described the parties as 'a place where girls would go and the boys would choose their targets'. The victims, who were described in court as 'emotionally immature' were abused from 2009 to 2014. Sentencing Hassan-Sule and the others in a court packed with friends and relatives of the defendants and victims yesterday, Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You put on charity events to raise money for your football club. 'This raised your profile among young people in Banbury and you saw yourself as a celebrity. 'Your friends helped put on these events and you became a sexually promiscuous group, not with your own girlfriends, but with girls who were young, vulnerable and lacking in maturity.' The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence, who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag'. Behind bars: Kagiso Manase, 26, (left) was jailed for four years and Said Saleh, 20, (right) was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute . One of the victims told the Oxford Mail: 'When I used to go missing I would swear at my mum and I didn't realise I was being really nasty to her. The men put me against my family – it was really clever. When I started hanging around with them I felt important. 'I had no friends and they were the only people left to talk to. It was a big part of my life and I was scared. I felt like all my friends were making new memories and I wasn't part of them. 'Calling people ""slags"" as the defence did in this case stops other girls from coming forward. I would say to other girls to think about the future. I never wanted to do it. I never wanted to have sex with them but I thought that's what friends did.' Thames Valley Police launched Operation Reportage after receiving a tip-off about the men's activities and eventually tracked down numerous teenager girls who had been molested. Detective Inspector Steve Raffield from Banbury Force CID said: 'This result would not have been possible without the bravery of the victims. 'I would like to thank them for coming forward and giving evidence in this case. As in all trials without their testimony we would not be where we are today. 'As a result young people will be safeguarded while these men will have time to reflect upon their actions in prison.' Convicted: Takudzwa Hova, 21, (left) was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, while Zsolt Szalontai, 18, (right) was sentenced to three years' detention in a Young Offenders' Institute after being found guilty of rape . Justice: The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence at Oxford Crown Court (pictured), who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag' Those jailed on Friday afternoon at Oxford Crown Court were: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, of Banbury, who was found guilty of 13 counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of assault by penetration. He was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years and nine months' imprisonment. Said Saleh, 20, from Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute. Takudzwa Hova, 21, of Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of rape. He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. Kagiso Manase, 26, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of sexual assault. He was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Manase had also pleaded guilty to possession of identity documents with intent. The offence related to being found in possession or control of a false South African passport and UK residence permit. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment to run consecutively.

"A busy town centre was brought to a standstill this afternoon after a mysterious 15-foot sinkhole opened up in the road without warning - almost swallowing a number of cars in the process. Motorists had to swerve out of the way of the giant hole after it appeared on the residential Earl Street in Northampton at around 2pm, just hours after part of a London pavement collapsed, swallowing a pedestrian. Shocking pictures show the gaping chasm - which was around eight foot (2.4 metres) wide - with a section of surrounding road also looking on the verge of collapse. Scroll down for video . Enormous: The hole opened up on Earl Street, Northampton, at about 2pm on Thursday . Blocked: Police quickly sealed off the road to avoid anyone falling into the hole, which is about eight foot wide . Police quickly closed off Earl Street, causing traffic chaos and leaving locals without water following damage to a water main. A barmaid from the Charles Bradlaugh pub, opposite the hole, who did not wish to be named, said: 'We saw it from inside the pub. 'It was weird. It just collapsed but it gave way really slowly. It was gradual. 'I am not at all sure why it happened. It was really strange.' Eyewitness Matthew Green, 24, was in the pub when he heard a loud bang. He said: 'I was just having a drink with my mate when there was this loud crashing noise. 'I thought there had been an accident but when I went outside, I saw the road had collapsed. 'The hole is massive. It must nearly cover half of the width of the whole road. 'Police were here pretty quick but cars had to swerve out of the way until we went out and stopped them . 'It is incredible. It is like something you would see in a disaster movie.' Gradual: One eyewitness said the road 'gave way really slowly' as people watched on . Unbelievable: Another person watching it collapse was 'like something you would see in a disaster movie' Van driver Chris Williams, 30, who was stuck in the traffic which backed as a result of the hole, added: 'I couldn't believe it. 'There was loads of traffic. It was horrendous. It backed up for a good few miles.' He added: 'It was very inconvenient.' A Northamptonshire Police spokesman said the incident had been handed over to Anglian Water from the Highways Authority and they were no longer involved. An Anglian Water spokesman added: 'We are still working to get the problem resolved. 'We do not yet know what caused it but fortunately nobody was injured. 'There were six properties without water in the area and it could be days or a couple of weeks until the road is reopened.' Coincidence: The five foot wide by two and a half foot long hole which suddenly appeared in London today . Meanwhile, investigations are continuing into how the pavement outside a cafe in Fulham, south-west London, came to collapse at about 8.50am. A woman, said to be in her 40s, had to be hospitalised after she fell through the hole into the basement of a cafe. Passers-by reported hearing a loud scream before the woman fell into the gap and early reports suggested she had been pushing a pram - although it's now thought it was a shopping trolley. Hammersmith & Fulham Council said that it is investigating claims that the cafe owner raised the issue with the council two months ago and the causes of the collapse. A council spokeswoman added: 'The council’s structural engineer has carried out an initial investigation of the basement collapse in North End Road and secured the site. 'The freeholder of the property is legally responsible for the structural integrity of their basement but we are carrying out a full review of what’s happened and will ensure the site is made safe and all necessary actions are taken once we have a full understanding of how this occurred.'","Cars forced to swerve to avoid street collapse in Northampton today .

"A confident young fox picked the wrong foe to steal his lunch from. The animal is pictured vying for a large deer bone as he crosses a frozen lake in Furen in Japan. While the fox appears to have some success fending off a flock of crows, when a pair of eagles turn up he soon finds out he has taken on more than he can handle. Scroll down for video . A bold red fox spots a deer bone on a frozen lake in Japan and begins to fight both a flock of crows and an eagle for the tasty lunch . The fox proudly holds the bone tight in its jaws as an eagle descends to challenge the animals over possession of the lunch . The large birds were photographed by Japanese businessman Sanin Alexander as they swooped down with their claws bared at the fox as he boldly grasps the bone in his jaws. At first the fox attempts to fight back, growling viciously at the advancing eagle. But as he is joined by a second the fox begins to lose the fight and realise he has possibly taken on more than he is capable of managing. The animal takes a tumble and lands on his head, losing the dispute over the bone. The Steller eagle advances, crowing at the fox as a warning to keep away from the bone, but the animal continues to keep trying . The result looks more desperate for the animal as a second eagle swoops in to challenge him over possession of the bone .

Mr Alexander, of Nemuro in Japan, said: 'Two young Steller's sea eagles and a group of crows were quarrelling which a red fox had also noticed.' Steller sea eagles are large birds of prey which live in coastal areas of north eastern Asia. It usually preys on birds and fish but the deer bone would have been a particularly good catch for the two birds who are likely to have moved in land to feed. In winter the eagles, which are the heaviest in the world, will also frequent slaughterhouses to try and get hold of bits of offal. Both animals faced off to each other, with the small red fox growling viciously at the advancing Steller eagle, often found in Japan .

And he will pledge to embrace the EU in a bid to secure reforms. ‘We will be rebuild our influence, and that starts with the EU,’ he will say. ‘I want a clear message to be sent to our European partners that an incoming Labour government will be serious about leading once again in Europe and serious also about reforming Europe. ‘Leaving Europe would be profoundly damaging to the lives of our people and the future of our country. We will never put the national interest at risk by threatening to leave.’ His comments echo a controversial intervention this month by Tony Blair, who said Britain’s membership of the EU was ‘too important’ to put to a public vote. Ukip's Nigel Farage . He was a foreigner thought to have been born in Turkey. But Ukip has insisted St George would be welcome in Britain today because of his skills as a dragon slayer. Yesterday on St George’s Day, the party announced that it would make it a Bank Holiday in England. At the policy launch, economic spokesman Patrick O’Flynn faced questions over whether England’s patron saint would have been welcomed by Ukip. In its election manifesto the party has said it would have a five-year moratorium on unskilled migrants moving to the country. Mr O’Flynn said: ‘Well, I guess dragon-slaying is a skill but whether it is one that’s in short supply for the needs of the British economy, we will leave to our migration commission.’ The party said it wanted to end a ‘cultural self-loathing’ about being proud to be English. Nigel Farage yesterday celebrated St George’s Day at a working men’s club in Ramsgate, in the South Thanet constituency he is hoping to represent. Asked whether Ukip would have welcomed St George, Mr Farage said: ‘I think there’s room within our immigration policy for heroes.’ Mr Miliband’s decision to turn his back on a referendum has angered some senior Labour figures, who fear it leaves the party looking dangerously out of touch with public opinion. But he will claim today that Britain’s hopes of achieving reform in Brussels have been weakened by Mr Cameron’s pledge to hold an In/Out referendum by the end of 2017. ‘This government’s approach to Europe means that even when Britain’s interests are shared by other member states, EU leaders are reluctant to support us because they think we already have one foot out of the door,’ he will say. He will accuse the Prime Minister of backing a referendum because he is ‘too weak’ to take on his party’s Right-wingers and his fear of Ukip. In an incendiary claim he will warn that Mr Cameron ‘has presided over the biggest loss of influence for our country in a generation’. Mr Miliband’s claim to statesmanship will anger Tory high command, who point out he withdrew his support for strikes on Syria for its use of chemical weapons in 2013 under pressure from Left-wingers in his shadow cabinet. But the Labour leader will accuse the Tories of failing to learn the lessons of the Iraq War. He will also commit to putting climate change ‘at the core of Labour’s foreign policy’, including pushing for costly targets to cut carbon emissions to zero. Former business secretary Lord Mandelson last night admitted voters were still spooked by the economic record of the last Labour government. He told Channel Four News: ‘People like Labour’s values and feel they are more in touch, but they have a problem about their record from the last government, and the last two years where people feel, fairly or not, that we allowed debt, borrowing and the deficit to run away from us.’ Lord Mandelson also acknowledged there was ‘quite of lot of fear’ among business leaders about the prospect of a Labour government. But he insisted it was ‘misplaced’. Mr Miliband (pictured above) is accusing David Cameron of ‘taking Britain to the edge of European exit’ With only David Cameron or Ed Miliband in a position to be Prime Minister after the election, voters face a stark choice on immigration policy. Here, JAMES SLACK examines the key differences between the party manifestos. NET MIGRATION . Tories: Re-state commitment to cut net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ from current level of 300,000. Make it harder for non-EU citizens to get marriage visas to enter the UK. Cap number of non –EU work visas at 20,700. Labour: No upper limit on net migration. Last Labour government presided over a deliberate open door policy which saw the foreign-born population rocket by 3.6million. Ed Miliband has said sorry for the calamitous underestimate of the number of Eastern Europeans who arrived – but, crucially, he refuses to accept unprecedented levels of non-EU migration were a mistake. MIGRANTS FROM EU . Tories: No in-work benefits for four years. Benefits for jobseekers stopped. Residency requirement for social housing. Citizens of poor countries which join the EU denied free movement. Labour: Prevent migrants from claiming handouts for two years. Support open borders with the EU. Would block in/out referendum or attempt to curb free movement. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS . Tories: New system of ‘deport first, appeal later’ to dramatically increase number of removals. Fit electronic tags on foreign criminals so they can be monitored by satellite pending deportation. Scrap Human Rights Act. Labour: Ideologically-wedded to HRA. Vague promise to ‘deport those who commit crimes while they are here’. Last Labour government released 1,000 overseas convicts without even considering them for deportation. FOREIGN STUDENTS . Tories: Clamp down on satellite campuses opened in London by universities based elsewhere in UK. Since 2010 party has closed 850 of the bogus colleges which proliferated under Labour. Labour: No mention of bogus colleges. Under last Labour government, wholesale abuse saw number of student visas issued more than triple. The National Audit Office found that in the 2009 as many as 50,000 bogus students may have entered the UK to work rather than study.","Labour leader has vowed to 'never' walk away from the European Union .

"We've all inadvertently put our foot in it while trying to be helpful to a fellow human at some point or another, but what's it like being on the receiving end of this day-in, day-out? Pretty irritating according to a new Ask Reddit thread, which invited members of the disabled community to list all the ways able-bodied people think they are being supportive, but  end up being just the opposite.

This was a popular theme. '[Don't tell me] how brave or strong I am,' one submitter wrote. 'I'm pretty sure I didn't say ""Hey, universe, make me handicapped."" 'There's nothing brave or strong about it. I exist. My strength and courage comes from what I do. Not what I am.'

'What am I supposed to do, sit on my a** all day and wait to die?' one posed. Another common complaint, particularly among wheelchair users, was people insisting they 'help', and not taking no for an answer. 'I have cerebral palsy,' wrote one. 'I love when people help me, but please always ask first, and I if I say, ""No thanks, I've got it"" then go on with your day.' Another raised some people's tendency to take charge of their wheelchair. '[The] situation would be similar to seeing someone who looked tired at the bottom of a hill, and offering to carry them up.

Perhaps the most obnoxious habit mentioned was people recommending 'diets', 'remedies' or 'cures'. 'Believe me, unless you are a researcher who specialises in my condition, you probably don't know more about treatments than me,' one advised.

"The anonymous waitress who publicly shamed the New Zealand Prime Minister for repeatedly pulling her hair while she was at work has been revealed as Amanda Bailey. The waitress told the New Zealand Herald that she published the details of John Key's behaviour, which she experienced while she was working at a cafe in Auckland, as she 'expected more from him' and wanted 'the public to be aware'. The 26-year-old, an employee at Rosie cafe which is frequented by Mr Key and his wife, recounted on The Daily Blog how the Prime Minister kept playfully pulling her hair despite being told to stop during election time last year. But following the publication of the blog on Wednesday, Mr Key defended his pranks as 'a bit of banter' and said he had already apologised for his actions, Stuff.co.nz reports. Scroll down for video . Amanda Bailey (right) with Jackie Grant and Scott Brown, whose company Hip Group owns Rosie cafe in Auckland where Ms Bailey works. The 26-year-old had her ponytail pulled by Prime Minister John Key while she was working in the cafe . While the waitress took to an online blog to detail how Mr Key pulled her hair in the cafe on six occasions, owners Jackie Grant and Scott Brown have spoken about their disappointment with Ms Bailey as she had never notified them of her concerns . A waitress has revealed how the New Zealand Prime Minister had repeatedly given her unwanted attention while she was working at a cafe in Auckland frequented by him and his wife Bronagh (pictured together) Ms Bailey told the Herald that she felt Mr Key's behaviour was inappropriate. 'I didn't feel I should have to put up with that,' she said. 'I expected more from him and I want the public to be aware. 'John Key feels he is untouchable.' However Jackie Grant and Scott Brown, whose company Hip Group owns Rosie cafe, told the Herald of their disappointment with Ms Bailey as she had never notified them of her concerns. They further stated that Mr Key is popular among the staff at Rosie cafe in Parnell, east of Auckland. The waitress had reportedly been working at a cafe called Rosie (pictured) in Parnell, east of Auckland . The waitress wrote how Mr Key kept being persistent with his hair-pulling antics, despite being told by his wife Bronagh to stop . In the blog, Ms Bailey wrote about how she made it very clear that she was unimpressed by Mr Key's gestures. 'He was like the school yard bully tugging on the little girls' hair trying to get a reaction, experiencing that feeling of power over her,' she wrote. Mr Key kept being persistent with his hair-pulling antics, despite being told by his wife Bronagh to stop. After dealing with the practical jokes over the six months he had visited the cafe, the waitress finally lost her cool. 'As he made his way out the door I said after him ""Please STOP or I will actually hit you soon!"",' she wrote. 'Everybody knew that I didn't like it, I really didn't like it. I felt powerless and tormented and I stepped out the back and I cried frustrated tears.' Key, who was en route to the Anzac ceremony in Gallipoli on Wednesday, told reporters he has a very 'warm and friendly relationship' with staff at the cafe. 'When I realised she took offence by that I just sort of immediately went back, gave her some wine, apologised and said I was terribly sorry,' he said according to Stuff.co.nz. 'It was all in the context of a bit of banter that was going on, and so obviously I immediately apologised for that. 'She thanked me for that and said ""that's all fine, no drama"".'

"A young mother who killed herself days after telling police she had been kidnapped and raped has given evidence in the trial of her alleged attacker from beyond the grave. A jury watched a distressing video interview in which the 20-year-old told officers how she flagged down a car belonging to Iranian Masood Mansouri believing he was a taxi driver. But instead of taking her to a nightclub with her university friends, it is alleged the 33-year-old drove off without them and took her to his home where he sexually assaulted and raped her. Masood Mansouri, 33, from Saltney, Flintshire, is accused of kidnap, rape and sexual assault . The woman, mother to a three-year-old girl, managed to escape by hiding in bushes, before getting another taxi to the club. Initially she tried to forget about the attack, the second sexual assault she had suffered in her short life. But she became so distressed the next day she broke down and told her mother. In a text message the woman, who had a history of depression, told her mother to make an appointment with her doctor, saying: ‘I really can’t handle being alive any more.’ She was interviewed by police, but five days later took an overdose of her mother’s blood pressure tablets and died. In her interview the alleged victim told officers: ‘I felt worthless and helpless and that I needed to tell someone. ‘I don’t feel like this is something which someone should be able to get away with.’ Judge Raj Shetty, sitting at Chester Crown Court, told the jury that the woman’s suicide made the case ‘unusual’ but stressed that it should not affect their judgment. The court heard that the alleged attack took place in the early hours of Sunday, August 10 last year. Nicholas Williams, prosecuting, said the woman, of Mochdre, North Wales, had been to a party with two Chester University friends at their halls of residence. A jury at Chester Crown Court was today shown a video-taped interview which the woman gave to police two days after the alleged incident. Five days later, the woman took a fatal overdose of prescription tablets . The group then decided to go to a nightclub around ten minutes’ drive away. After struggling to get a cab, the woman flagged down Mansouri’s BMW 3 series, believing it to be a taxi, and asked him to wait for her friends who were still inside. But he allegedly sped off and drove to his home in the suburb of Saltney, Chester. The woman became frightened and sent three chilling text messages to one of her friends, saying she had been ‘kidnapped’ and that she was ‘not joking’. The final one added: ‘Literally scared.’ When they arrived, the woman repeatedly said she did not want to go inside but told police she felt ‘trapped and intimidated’ so agreed. Mansouri, it is alleged, started trying to kiss her, before carrying out the ‘rough’ sexual assault and rape. After she reported the alleged attack, the woman was examined and Mansouri’s DNA was discovered. He was arrested but claimed the sex was consensual. In a statement, the girl’s mother, a college support assistant, told officers that her eldest daughter had been the victim of a sex assault when she was 15. The man was later prosecuted and jailed. The court heard that following the first attack, the woman became depressed and started suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. She had a baby but could not cope with looking after her daughter. Six months before her death, the court heard, the woman was hospitalised nine times after trying to commit suicide. But her mother said that immediately before the alleged rape she had appeared happier. Mansouri denies three counts of kidnapping, sexual assault and rape. The trial continues.

"Australia's most notorious serial killer could have been caught before he murdered seven backpackers, had the 'wrong man' not been sent to prison, a new investigation has claimed. Channel Seven's Sunday Night will tell the story of Ivan Milat's first violent crime and how he escaped police prosecution, before going on to butcher seven backpackers. The revelation includes first-hand evidence from Milat's older brother, Boris, into the killer's 'secret victim'. Scroll down for video . A new report claims Ivan Milat, Australia's most notorious serial killer, could have been caught before he murdered seven backpackers . Boris Milat shares a secret he has kept for 52 years, which details how Australia's bloodiest butcher was responsible for the shooting more than two decades before the first backpacker murder in 1989, according to the report. The program also puts Mr Milat face-to-face with the 'wrong man', who was jailed for the first crime his brother committed. 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man, who Channel Seven has not yet named, tells Mr Milat, as they shake hands. According to the timeline presented by the program and Mr Milat, his murderous brother would have been a 19-year-old when he claimed his first victim. Former Detective Paul Gordon tells the program the evidence uncovered is 'unbelievable' and 'incredible'. Boris Milat tells the program a secret about his brother he had kept for more than 52 years . Milat was later sentenced to life in prison, but if the 'wrong man' (right) had not been jailed for his first crime, Milat's victims could have been saved, the program claims . 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man imprisoned for Milat's first violent crime told the killer's brother, Boris . Milat, 70, was convicted of butchering seven young people between 1989 and 1992 and burying their bodies in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW. He has been locked up in Goulburn's Supermax jail for almost 20 years. The first two bodies of Milat’s victims were discovered on September 19 and 20 1992, when two runners found a decaying corpse in the Belanglo State Forest. According to claims made by the program, Milat would have been about 19 when he claimed his first victim . The daughter of Milat's first victim (left) is told her father was shot by the serial killer. Former Detective Paul Gordon (right) tells the program the evidence uncovered is 'unbelievable' and 'incredible' The report claims Milat's seven victims could have been saved if he had been been held accountable for this first chilling crime . Police later confirmed the bodies were of missing British backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters. Walters had been stabbed 35 times and Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head. The grim finds were just the beginning of a long and extensive search which resulted in the bodies of Australians Deborah Everist and James Gibson being found in October 1993, followed by Simone Schmidl’s stabbed body in November of the same year. The decapitated body of German backpacker Anja Habschied was then found along with her boyfriend Gabor Neugebauer on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart. British backpacker Caroline Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head when police found her body . First victims: Australians James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both aged 19, were Ivan Milat's first known victims after they disappeared in December 1989 and their bodies were found in the Belanglo State forest almost four years later . Simone Schmidl's body was found in November 1993. She had been stabbed to death . Milat was convicted of the seven backpacker murders on July 27, 1996 and for the attempted murder, false imprisonment and robbery of Paul Onions. He kept the shirts, sleeping bags, a water bottle, portable stove and backpacks of his victims hidden in roof and wall cavities, in what was described as an 'Aladdin's Cave', in the house he was arrested in 20 years ago. Boyfriend and girlfriend German backpackers Gabor Neugebauer and Anja Habschied were found dead on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart . British backpacker Joanne Walters, is another one of the victims of backpacker murderer Ivan Milat . Sinister souvenir: In this photograph police seized from the house of Ivan Milat's brother William, the serial killer is seen carrying the sleeping bag which belonged to Deborah Everist who with boyfriend Jame Gibson was the first of Milat's victims killed in the Belanglo State Forest . The evil killer has penned a series of rambling letters while behind bars, according to a book released by his eldest nephew, Alistair Shipsey. The Milat Letters, is a compilation of 94 notes from Milat to his eldest nephew Alistair Shipsey. Milat is serving seven consecutive life sentences for the murders of seven backpackers in  NSW between 1989 and 1992. In the letters, he tells Shipsey about his 'fair share' of 'sheilas', who write 'some frightening things' - and one woman who has even proposed. Australia's worst serial killer Ivan Milat kept trophies to remind him of each murder . Milat butchered and buried the bodies of seven young people between 1989 and 1992 in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW . 'Every month someone new writes; the latest one was from Texas. She tells me she’s 25, white. I ought to ask her “why” as she only knows me from a website, and there’s nothing nice about me on it,' one of the letters reads. 'As you know there are a lot of wackos out there as well. A lot of them write to me at times. I tell you Al, there are some real crazy people out and about.' Milat has been a troublesome inmate during his time in prison, and it is believed he planned at least one escape and swallowed metal objects in an attempt to get out of jail. An extract from one of the letters from Milat, written before he chopped his own finger off with a plastic knife in January 2009, affectionately refers to Shipsey as 'Al . In prison, Milat, has been a troublesome inmate, having planned at least one escape, swallowing metal objects and cutting off his own finger to send to the High Court in an envelope .

"Overcoming terminal cancer through healthy eating - that statement in print appears dubious at best.

Belle cast a spell through her endearing vulnerability and charming personality, collecting an enormous social media following who were enamoured with her brave account of reclaiming her health. Wellness warrior Belle Gibson has admitted that she never had cancer and does not want forgiveness . Now that Belle has admitted she made her story up, we ask ourselves, how could we have fallen so hard for an account of what many have called a medical miracle, without a shred of supporting evidence? The answer is very simple. We wanted to believe. And we did not so much believe in Belle´s story, as we believed in Belle. Everyone loves a heart-warming account of overcoming the odds. We were enchanted by Belle´s journey, as well as by Belle herself. A beautiful, young, inspirational woman, we fell in love with her story as well as with her—which caused us even to downplay the rumours and suspicions of sceptics within the medical community as the fabric of her brave fight against cancer began to unravel. Here are five ways that the Belle´s of the world win us over. She founded the Whole Pantry - a book and app which over 300,000 people have downloaded . Appearances are Reality—and Seeing is Believing . Believe it or not, studies show that people cannot distinguish between behaviour that is honest and behaviour that is deceptive. This causes us to make the easier judgement—that other people are truthful. To make matters worse, when we like someone, we are likely to believe they are truthful, even when they are lying. How do we overcome the truthfulness bias? One way is to closely examine a person´s motives. When someone relays a heart-warming story, as Belle did, what is she getting out of it? While many people do not want to spoil a happy ending with a cloud of suspicion, examining prospective outcomes for the storyteller often raises suspicions about potential ulterior motives that might otherwise never come to light. Wendy L. Patrick PhD says we fell for Belle Gibson because 'we love heartwarming stories—especially comeback stories' Born to Bond - There is a Bit of Belle in All of Us . We love heart-warming stories—especially comeback stories. Especially when we feel an affinity to the heroine. We were Belle´s cheerleaders as she recounted her fight against cancer—using a weapon we all have at our disposal: healthy eating. Every one of us could be Belle in the future, because cancer strikes without warning. We loved walking along side her in her journey, recognizing there is a bit of Belle in all of us. We identified with her vulnerability, celebrated her success in regaining her health, and felt empowered by the recognition that although we each face different hurdles, if she could beat the odds, so can we.

Belle released a whole foods recipe book and top-rating food app, which thousands of people bought. Why? Because she was a certified nutritionist? Because the medical community validated her recipes? Nope. Simply because we liked her, and therefore viewed her as credible. When we view someone as credible, we rely on their guidance and believe what they say. Unfortunately, this blind trust can create emotional blinders that cause us to miss, misinterpret, or discount red flags. Credibility is not a speaker trait, but a perception created in an audience. Credible, likeable, well-spoken communicators are believed to possess a wide range of positive traits including reliability, trustworthiness, goodwill, and expertise. Believe it or not, we also view such people as an authority, even when we do not have any personal knowledge of their credentials.

Belle Gibson is an attractive young woman with an endearing personality. We can´t help but smile as we watch the video footage documenting her journey, including her hopes, dreams, and bright plans for the future.

"Accused: Patrick Fredricksen, 30, in a police photo . A known child sex offender has been arrested on suspicion of stealing a school bus and driving it around to pick up youngsters. Patrick James Fredricksen, 30 - who has previous convictions for unlawful sexual activity with a minor and impersonating a firefighter - was stopped on his way to one child's home in eastern Utah, police say. He had already used the bus's on-board list of children's names and addresses to try and abduct a young girl, they added. Fredricksen has now been booked into Emery County Jail for investigation of theft of a vehicle and attempted child kidnapping. He is also expected to face a charge of damaging a prison after breaking a sprinkler pipe inside his cell and flooding the booking area, said sheriff spokeswoman Janalee Luke. Fredricksen's crime spree is alleged to have started while he was laying turf for a landscaping firm at a baseball complex in Huntington on Monday. An employee at the site phoned the local sheriff's office to report a worker 'was acting strange' and had left on foot with a set of master keys to the complex. Shortly afterwards, a nearby funeral-parlor worker reported that his car had been stolen from the company car park. Audacious: Fredricksen is said to have taken an American school bus and driven it to youngsters' homes . He told police he had noticed a 'suspicious' person around the building' but was talking to a bereaved family at the time so 'wasn't too concerned', according to the sheriff's office. They claim Fredricksen was the thief and that he drove the car to an empty school bus, which had its keys inside. 'After stealing the bus and using a list he found in the bus containing names and directions [to children's houses], Fredricksen attempted to pick one child up at her home and was asking directions to a second child's home,' said the sheriff's office. He had been foiled in his first attempt to a child after parking the bus on the family's driveway, according to KSL News. The girl's father got to the vehicle first and would not let her board after quizzing the driver. Fredricksen was eventually stopped by a sheriff's lieutenant following a report of a suspicious person driving a school bus in the Cleveland area of Emery County. The lieutenant said he halted the slow-moving vehicle by pulling in front of it. The empty school bus, thought to be identical to the ones seen here in Utah, reportedly had its keys inside . Fredricksen, who has also used the names Pat Shelton and Patrick Fredrickson, is on Utah's Sex Offender Registry after pleading guilty in 2004 to unlawful sexual activity with a minor. Court records show he was separately charged in 2005 with sexual exploitation of a minor and dealing in material harmful to a minor but the case was dismissed as part of an apparent plea bargain that resolved another case against him. The following year, Fredricksen was living in Salt Lake County when he pleaded guilty to impersonating a fireman. He had previously worked as a volunteer firefighter for the Huntington Fire Department but was dismissed in 2003 for stealing clothing and equipment. After his dismissal, he pinned on a stolen badge and lent a hand at emergencies, the court was told. He discovered where the real firefighters were working by listening to a police scanner. He also stole firefighting equipment and used his fake status to rent an apartment and get credit, according to newspaper reports from the time. He was sentenced to 36 months of probation and ordered to have counselling.","Patrick James Fredricksen was stopped on way to child's home, say police .

"Taxes will be £12billion a year higher under Labour than the Tories, independent experts warned yesterday – equal to £1,052 for every working household. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said Ed Miliband's 'vague' promise to balance the books would allow Labour to borrow £90billion more than the Tories by 2020. This would rise to £280billion in extra debt by the end of the next decade if Labour remained in power. Institute for Fiscal Studies said Ed Miliband's 'vague' promise to balance the books would allow Labour to borrow £90billion more than the Tories by 2020 and this would rise to £280b in extra debt by the  next decade . David Cameron said the assessment showed Labour was 'a risk to our recovery, a risk to our economy, a risk to jobs' The think-tank warned that Labour's failure to control borrowing would leave Britain 'less well placed to deal with future adverse events', such as another recession or the costs of an ageing population. But it was also highly critical of the lack of detail in the Conservatives' plans, saying the party had failed to spell out where it would find tens of billions of pounds in cuts. In a withering verdict, it said all the main parties were keeping voters 'in the dark' about what they would do, adding: 'None of the parties has provided anything like full details of their fiscal plans for each year of the coming parliament.' IFS director Paul Johnson said: 'All the parties have told us where they are going to increase spending on things like health, but none have said much about where the pain is going to fall.' He said the gap between the parties' plans was 'bigger than any time since 1992' – giving voters a clear choice between more taxes, spending or borrowing. Conservative plans require Whitehall cuts of £30billion, while Labour could get away with savings of just £1billion. Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, added: 'The electorate has a real choice, although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice.' The IFS said Labour's plans were broadly compatible with those of its potential post-election partners in the SNP. The Scottish nationalists want to spend an extra £4billion on benefits. But in an unflattering assessment, the IFS said there was a 'significant disconnect' between its anti-austerity rhetoric and its plans. Labour said the think-tank had made 'wrong assumptions' about its plans. Ed Balls said: 'The IFS has confirmed that the Tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party, with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years' One in ten cancer sufferers need care at home but do not get any support, figures revealed today. It means there are around 160,000 cancer sufferers in the UK left housebound by a lack of support. The shocking statistics were released by Labour as they attacked the 'crisis' in elderly care. Separate figures show three-quarters of councils are subjecting vulnerable pensioners to care visits lasting only 15 minutes. Labour said it would end 'time-limited' 15-minute visits by changing the system of paying for care by taking into consideration all of a patient's health needs, rather than costing them separately. The party is also committed to allowing the terminally ill with the 'greatest care needs' to have the right to die in their own homes. The cancer figures were taken from a report by Macmillan cancer support which warned of sufferers left housebound, unable to wash or dress themselves – even at risk of soiling themselves – because of a lack of care. The Daily Mail has highlighted the scandal of hundreds of thousands of frail, elderly people facing 'clock-watch' care visits with its Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said he is developing new commissioning standards which will discourage 15-minute visits. Mr Miliband has promised to balance day-to-day government spending by 2020 – leaving Labour free to continue borrowing around £30billion a year for 'investment'. By contrast, the Conservatives want to clear the deficit in three years and start paying off Britain's £1.5trillion debt mountain. David Cameron said the assessment showed Labour was 'a risk to our recovery, a risk to our economy, a risk to jobs'. But the IFS also raised major questions about the Tories' spending plans. It said they involved 'substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases', and warned they could mean 'further real cuts to unprotected departments of around £30billion'. Tory plans for £12billion in welfare cuts have also not been spelled out in any detail. The IFS said the Lib Dems deserved a 'small tick' for being the most transparent – although they were also criticised for failure to spell out £12billion of planned spending cuts. Chancellor George Osborne said: 'Saving money means taking the difficult decisions so we reduce our debt and keep our economy out of crisis and on an even keel.' But Mr Balls said: 'The IFS has confirmed that the Tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party, with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years.' Nick Clegg said it confirmed the Tories plan a 'cuts bombshell', adding: 'We will cut substantially less than the Conservative plan to cut many public services to the bone and borrow less than the reckless plan from Labour.' All three of the main parties' education spokesmen revealed they would have no problem with the next education secretary sending their children to private school. The BBC's Daily Politics presenter Andrew Neil asked the trio if such a choice would be 'acceptable for an education secretary'. Labour's Tristram Hunt, who was privately educated, said: 'Yes. In certain circumstances.' Two of his three children go to a state primary school in North London, with the third expected to go to the same school. But he has not ruled out switching them to independent schools. Privately educated Schools Minister David Laws – who has no children – immediately said 'yes' to the question. And Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who was privately educated but sends her son to a state primary school, replied: 'Yes, you do what's right for the child.' Ukip's Jonathan Arnott and the Green Party's James Humphreys also agreed there was no problem with a future education secretary sending their children private – though Mr Arnott added it would be an 'indictment' of the quality of state schools. Only 7 per cent of children in the UK are privately educated. Ukip has pledged to bring back grammar schools by converting some comprehensives, but Mrs Morgan said it would be a 'step backwards'. The rare frankness about whether they would opt for a private education for their children is in stark contrast to the controversy sparked by Labour Left-winger Diane Abbott sending her son to the exclusive fee-paying City of London School. Miss Abbott had previously criticised Harriet Harman, now Labour's deputy leader, for sending her children to a selective grammar school. Many politicians on the Left have managed to get their children into elite state schools. Both Tony Blair – who converted to Catholicism after standing down – and atheist Nick Clegg, bagged places at leading London Oratory for their children. Both men are married to Catholics.","Institute for Fiscal Studies says taxes will be £12b higher under Labour .

"A 36-year-old father in Los Angeles has been arrested and charged over the abduction of a two-year-old girl from a car wash earlier this month, who was sexually abused and then dumped in a restaurant parking lot hours later. Police say the key to tracking down the suspect, Michael David Ikeler, of Torrance, was a tip from his observant neighbor, who noticed Ikeler altering the appearance of his car. Investigators had released CCTV footage of the car - a white Nissan Altima - from the crime scene at the self-serve carwash in Gardena on April 2. The mother was washing her car when she heard the toddler scream 'Mommy', only to turn around and find her daughter gone. At the time police described the driver of the vehicle as a serial predator, KTLA reported. Predator: Michael David Ikeler, 36 - seen here in previous booking photos from 2013 - was arrested April 9 and has pleaded not guilty to three felony counts of sexual assault in relation to the abduction of a little girl . Wanted: This CCTV footage of a white Nissan Altima was the way police were able to track Ikeler down, after a neighbor saw it on the news and then noticed Ikeler trying to alter his car, which looked the same . Scene: The little was found alone and naked in this parking lot at Jim's Burgers. She was crying and had obvious injuries on her body, witnesses said . The girl, who has not been identified, was found just over two hours later in the dark parking lot of Jim's Burgers, 13 miles away, after being spotted by concerned customers next to a dumpster. She was naked, alone and had obvious injuries. Witnesses say there were scratches on her legs and that she was screaming and putting her hands over her eyes. Detectives worked around the clock to find the kidnapper responsible for the “horrific attack,” A tip came in on April 5 from a man who had seen the footage on the Nissan Altima on TV, and said his neighbor, Ikela, had been making changes to his car, which fit the description. Ikela was switching the number plates, removing the tint, and doing other cosmetic alterations like adding stickers, the neighbor said. Undercover officers began investigating. DNA evidence was gathered that linked Ikela to the horrific attack. Arrest: Undercover Gardena police officers Ikela's house in Torrance (pictured) and his car on Regina Street near 183rd Street . Father: Ikela lives with his 18-year-old daughter and also has other children. He is being held on a $1 million bond . Ikela was arrested at his home in Torrance  and charged with one count of lewd act upon a child with a kidnapping allegation, and two counts of oral copulation or sexual penetration with child 10 years old or younger, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office said. He entered a not guilty plea on April 13. Police have only just released the information about Ikela's arrest, saying they are doing their best to protect the family of the victim. 'I haven’t seen a crime like this in the 20 years I’ve been in Gardena,' a police lieutenant said. 'Our detectives are so thankful to the public and the person who called us,' Gardena Police Lt. Steve Prendergrast told CBS. Ikeler has been arrested previously in Northern California and Arizona but not for crimes involving children. He also has children of his own. Neighbors say his 18-year-old daughter lives with him, and his social media accounts show more kids that appear to his as well. Investigators initially said the person responsible for the kidnapping was a serial predator. Police said Ikeler circled the car wash and as soon as the little girl wandered away, he snatched her. After the little girl was found, the frantic 911 call her mother made was released. The two-year-old girl from Gardena, California,  disappeared from this car wash on April 2 . On the 911 call, the mother can be heard saying: 'I heard a scream and then when I cam around to see her…I heard her say ‘Mom’ and that’s when I turned around to see her washing and she was gone.' Claudia Robles, who was heading into the burger joint where the child was found around 7.15pm, said that the little girl had scratches on her legs and was afraid of going toward the male police officers. The little girl, whom Gardena police have asked not to be identified, repeatedly covered her eyes and screamed after she was found. Police, who originally said she was OK, kept mum on the extent of the girl's injuries and the extent that she had been abused, according toKTLA. The girl's mother was too distressed to speak to media. 'She's a pure little innocent baby,' her aunt Grecian Alvarez said. Police would not describe the extent of the young girl's injuries. Above, the white Nissan was also seen driving in a Gardena neighborhood . Caesar Alvarez, the girl's uncle, said that she was doing well. She was taken to St Francis Medical Center for examination.","Girl disappeared from a car wash in Gardena, California, on April 2 .

Sociology professor Mario Gaviria, the force behind the application, argues that Benidorm should be praised for being one of the few places where beach holidays are accessible for all.

"Until now, Tom Sturridge has been best known as the long-haired hipster who finally tamed Sienna Miller. Yet this year it looks as though the 29-year-old actor, who counts Robert Pattinson and Andrew Garfield among his best friends, could be set to become more famous than his A-list fiancee. Not only is the London-born actor wowing the West End  in American Buffalo, he's about to step into the costume drama void left by Aidan Turner's Poldark, when he plays Sergeant Troy to Carey Mulligan's Bathsheba in the hotly-anticipated new adaptation of Far From The Madding Crowd. Scroll down for video . Tom Sturridge the fiance of Sienna Miller could be set to overtake his partner in the fame stakes this year as he stars in the West End play American Buffalo and is set to release a film with Ryan Gosling . And the classically tall, dark and handsome thesp will no doubt earn himself a legion of female fans as the red-coated miliary man who courts Bathsheba Everdene. However up until now it was his relationship with Sienna Miller - which began in March 2011 - which had everyone talking. Those who have met the actor say he is shy and reserved - a far cry from Sienna's previous conquests Jude Law and Daniel Craig. But despite his laid back demeanor Tom - described by Richard Curtis as 'handsome, but also quirky and charming - is slowly but surely making a name for himself as a talented young actor. His first big film break came in 2013 when he starred in the movie adaptation of Jack Kerouac's On The Road alongside Kristen Stewart and Garrett Hedlund. And he is  currently treading the boards in the West End, starring alongside Damian Lewis and John Goodman in the David Mamet play American Buffalo which opened this month. And later this year he will feature alongside Ryan Gosling, Rooney Mara and Natalie Portman in the new film Weightless. Sienna and Tom have been dating since 2011, the pair got together in 2011 shortly after she split from the actor Jude Law for a second time . However he says he is careful not to spread himself to thin when it comes to his work: 'I choose carefully,' he said, 'I'm not afraid of not working.' And it is this slow and steady approach that seems to be making him the critics' favourite. In 2013 when he starred in the Broadway play Orphans he was nominated for a prestigious Tony Award. The reviewer for the Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney, singled out Tom's 'killer Broadway debut' performance, writing: 'He shows astonishing athleticism and expressive physicality, leaping from one surface to another with simian agility or shrinking into a huddled ball. 'But he also conveys the alert mind ticking away behind the stuttering words and the twitchy, obsessive behaviour. 'There's a distinct sense here of a docile but unpredictable caged animal, literally about to burst with pent-up energy.' Tom counts Andrew Garfield (left) and Robert Pattinson (right) among his close friends . In 2012 Tom starred alongside Rob's then on / off girlfriend Kristen Stewart and is thought to have been close friends with the actress . But his sheer talent and growing reputation may come as a surprise to those who knew Tom growing up, as unlike many of his peers, he never planned to be an actor. Born into a thespian family - his father Charles Sturridge directed the original Brideshead Revisited series as well as A Handful Of Dust, and his mother is actress Phoebe Nicholls - Tom told The Telegraph: 'As children, my siblings and I were actively discouraged from acting. I have no memories of going on set with my parents – aside from Gulliver's Travels.' His father cast him in the TV special starring Ted Danson because he wanted a child actor he could talk to. The actor remembered: 'All I remember is occasionally having conversations with my father and then someone filming me.' But  he began to rebel against the acting world he knew so well and struggled with life at the elite £13,500-a-year Harrodian School in west London (where he met best friend Robert Pattinson). He said: 'I left school early in my last year before I took my A-levels. I wasn't expelled. It was just a mutual understanding. I wasn't interested in going to school and they said, ""You're not turning up"", so we severed ties. Both sides appreciated it.' That rebellious streak certainly shows up in his distinctive scruffy, trendy style - his penchant for skinny jeans, pork pie hats, lumberjack shirts and skinny ties - and earned him the notice of fashion house Burberry who cast Tom and his fiancee Sienna in a moody black and white ad together. Sienna and Tom  got together in 2011, not long after she split from Jude for the second time. The pair became engaged soon after and they welcomed their daughter Marlowe  on July 7, 2012. Sienna says that being with Tom and having their daughter Marlowe - born in 2012 - has changed her life . Although discreet about their life together, the short clip filmed by Mario Testino provided a touching insight into the couple's strong bond as they flirted, laughed, gazed into each others' eyes and kissed passionately. Creative director Christopher Bailey said: 'This was a shoot full of love and laughter. It was such a treat to work with Sienna and Tom, and to capture their magic together.' That 'magic' is something Sienna is profoundly grateful for. In December, the 33-year-old told Vogue: 'Tom is a grounded, intelligent, kind, and intact person. That's amazing to be around. That's the father of my child. There's no drama.' Of having their daughter Marlowe in July 2012 she said: 'I was overwhelmed by how normal it felt. It was like, ""There you are - that's what I have been missing"". 'Like we're both in on something only we know. An amazing sense of being complicit with a little being.' Tom attended the 2015 Oscars Vanity Fair party with his fiance Sienna and his best friend Robert Pattinson . Today the pair are one of the most sought-after on the party circuit but keeping their life low-key is a priority. Sienna said: 'We go to the country. I like to cook and go to Whole Foods. I have a [Newfoundland] dog - not a dog but a bear - who when I walk pulls me over flat on my face into the mud. 'My baby pukes on me. It's life. It's very much a normal life. I really don't want to sound boring. It's completely crazy and illicit behind closed doors.' In a 2009 interview Tom revealed that he carried a private journal everywhere with him in which he wrote stories and musings. He said: 'I write constantly, about everything.' Now as Tom prepares for big screen stardom, the question now is not whether he has enough to jot into his diary, but whether he has the time.","Tom Sturridge, 29, will star in American Buffalo alongside Damian Lewis .

"It's every interviewer's worst nightmare. Ask the wrong question and you find your interviewee walking out on you mid sentence. Which is exactly what happened when Channel 4 news presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy tried to ask the actor Robert Downey Jr about his drug-taking past. After questioning the 50-year-old actor as to whether he had managed to fight his demons the actor said: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out of the interview. Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy looks bemused as Robert Downey Junior walks out on an interview with him after the journalist asked him about his personal life . In the footage of the short-lived chat Krishnan is then seen looking dumbfounded as Robert goes to head out of the room. The American star is in London to promote his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron but became aggravated when the chat took a turn for the personal. Seemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy is then seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone. At that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].' The horror was clear to see on Robert's face as he questioned Krishnan about where he was trying to take their chat . But Robert isn't the first celebrity to lose his cool in the face of an awkward line of questioning. Naomi Campbell, Robert Pattinson and Peter Andre have all cut their chat time short - especially when, like with Mr Downey Jr, the conversation has turned to their private lives. Justin Bieber was once angered by a radio show host asked him about his friendship with One Direction and compared him to Justin Timberlake. And Rihanna became annoyed in Australia and cut off a chat about her film Battleship when questions began to focus on her love life. Here are the celebrities who couldn't stand the heat so they got out of the interview: . The model Naomi Campbell is known for her firey temper and stormed out of an interview - breaking a camera in her wake - after being asked about a blood diamond she had apparently been given . NAOMI CAMPBELL . In April 2010 Naomi Campbell, who is known for her fiery temper, stormed out of an interview with ABC news kicking their camera over on the way. The reporter had asked the supermodel about whether she had received a blood diamond from the deposed Liberian despot Charles Taylor. Naomi said: 'I didn't receive a blood diamond and I'm not going to speak about that.' The interviewer continued to push the 44-year-old until she ended the chat curtly saying: 'Thank you very much,' and walking off. In court Naomi later admitted that she had been given, 'a few dirty rocks,' by Taylor when she testified against him. Robert Pattinson became incredibly awkward whilst, when promoting Twilight: New Moon, he was asked about his relationship with Kristen Stewart . ROBERT PATTINSON . When Robert Pattinson was promoting the Twilight film New Moon in 2009 he had an awkward run-in with Ryan Seacrest. Ryan starts the interview by asking Rob about how he is finding fame but the conversation quickly turned to his then relationship with his co-star Kristen Stewart. Ryan quizzed the actor on what he tells fans when they ask about their relationship at which point his PR swiftly interjects and reprimands the Radio host. Rob becomes visibly awkward and is ushered out of the interview as a stunned Seacrest reveals that it's the first time he's ever been cut off. As Rob leaves he jokes that he would tell his fans to watch this film but it doesn't do anything to ease the awkward tension. Justin Bieber might be close friends with One Direction but he didn't like it when a radio host asked about whether Harry Styles would flirt with his mum . JUSTIN BIEBER . In 2012 pop singer Justin Bieber did an incredibly awkward interview with the online American radio show, MOJO In The Morning. The host describes how the interview went 'horribly wrong,' saying that Justin initially got offended when he compared him to Justin Timberlake. Justin says: 'That's crazy 'cos our voices sound nothing alike... saying I sound like someone is not really a compliment.' He then got upset when the interviewer started asking him about One Direction, in particular Harry Styles. The presenter questions him: 'Do you worry about Harry around your mum as he seems to like older women?' to which Justin retorts, 'I think you should worry about me round your mum, so...' The radio host then informs Justin that his mum is dead and the pop star hangs up on him. An awkward chat with Justin's 'people' ensued in which MOJO are told the singer won't be calling back. Peter Andre tried to keep his cool when he was interviewed by Kay Burley in 2010 but when the conversation turned to his children the TV presenter managed to reduce him to tears . PETER ANDRE . In 2010 Peter Andre joined Kay Burley on the coach for Sky News and she proceeded to prod him on his ex-wife Katie Price's recent marriage to Alex Reid. In particular the TV presenter was keen to know whether Peter and Katie's children were aware that their mother had re-married. Which lead them on to the subject of the model's first son Harvey. Harvey was the child of Price and footballer Dwight Yorke - although he was largely bought up by Andre, who still plays a role in his life to this day. During the segment Kay played Peter a clip of Dwight insinuating that the singer should never have said that he wanted to adopt the boy with whom the footballer has very little contact. An understandably defensive Peter went on to question whether Yorke had seen his son and to question why he Dwight would find Peter disrespectful when all he did was love his son. Kay then asked Peter how he would feel is Alex Reid wanted to adopt his two children Junior and Princess at which point the singer became upset asking for the interview to be terminated.

"When rural farmer Ashley Stewart and his wife Felicity found a baby male kangaroo on the side of the road in 2013, they had no idea that the little joey would quickly become part of their family. Two years on, the curious and friendly joey they have dubbed 'Dusty' is now so comfortable living with the couple and their dogs Lilly and Rosie on their farm, near Esperance in Western Australia, that the Stewart's are convinced he actually thinks he is a dog too. Dusty rides around the property in the back of Mr Stewart's truck along with the dogs, sleeps with them on a dog bed, eats with them, asks for scratches, and even tries to sneak dog treats when he can. Scroll down for video . Dusty the kangaroo (right) has convinced himself that he is a dog, and spends his days with Ashley and Felicity Stewart's dogs Rosie and Lilly, on the couple's farm in Esperance, Western Australia . His unique behaviour began when Mr Stewart decided to drive down to a dam on the couple's property in Wittenoom Hills, 60 kilometres from Esperance, and loaded Lilly, a golden retriever, and Rosie, a border collie, into the truck bed. 'I loaded the dogs in and he was hanging around and looking up at the truck and so I just picked him up and put him in the back with them,' Mr Stewart told Daily Mail Australia. 'I didn't think too much of it, we drove down and came back together,' he said. 'He's been fine sitting on the back, as I don't drive too fast because I'd be worried about him jumping off. He doesn't jump in, I lift him in and out.' While the adventure down to the dam has only happened a few times, Dusty, who the couple often call 'Skip', has also picked up some very canine-like habits. 'He's either eating or sleeping. He's a very placid creature, and every time you walk out the door if he's not laying in his bed he comes up and wants a pat and a scratch,' Mr Stewart said. 'He even puts his arms up and wraps them around you like he's giving you a cuddle,' he said. And just like most dogs, while Dusty gets along well with Lilly and Rosie, he doesn't care much for the couple's cat. Dusty the kangaroo sleeps and eats with the dogs, and often tries to sneak their food as well as his own . Mr Stewart said that Dusty will hold his arms up and wrap them around like he is trying to give a cuddle . 'He just likes to hang out with the dogs, probably because he thinks he's a dog. He eats and sleeps with them, and will wander down to the shed with them and lay around if I'm working there,' Mr Stewart said. Dusty also has a collar, like many dogs, as a protective measure to ensure he can be found at nighttime. 'When he was little we used to let him out during the day and he'd go off grazing and wouldn't come back at night, so we'd have to go looking for him,' Mr Stewart said. 'We just couldn't find him as kangaroos don't make any noise and are very still,' he said. 'Once we found him he would always come back with us, so we decided to wrap some reflective tape around a collar so when we shone a torch at night we could see him'. While Mr Stewart said that there are 'plenty of people around who look after orphaned joeys', their situation is a bit unusual. 'In a rural area like this there are always kangaroos around who unfortunately get hit on the road and for various reasons orphaned joeys are found, and so we weren't sure when we took him home what would happen,' he said. But by the time the couple had started to feed him, and weened him off milk, he was part of the clan. Now, instead of milk, Dusty eats a mixture of grains, and guinea pig/rabbit food, his favourite treats are an apple or bread. 'Although when we feed the dogs he often wants what they're having,' said Mr Stewart. Unsurprisingly for a joey who has convinced himself he's one of the pups, he often  tries to get some of the dog biscuits too.","Dusty the kangaroo was adopted by the Stewart family from Esperance .

"A young woman who thought she was doing her grocery alone made a surprising discovery after finding a mildly venomous snake curled up in her shopping trolley. The unnamed woman, from the Sunshine Coast, found an empty trolley in an underground car park at the supermarket giant Coles in Caboolture, north of Brisbane on Wednesday. She pushed the trolley up the escalator to do her shopping before realising the slithering brown tree snake had curled itself in the corner and was hitching a ride to the store. Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7 Richie Gilbert was called to remove the snake and release it back into the bushland just kilometres away. A young woman made a surprising discovering after finding a mildly venomous snake in her shopping trolley . Snake catcher Richie Gilbert came to the rescue and safely removed the sleepy little snake outside the store . 'The woman found it through a pile of trolleys downstairs and pushed it up the escalator before realising the sleepy little snake was there the whole time,' Mr Gilbert told Daily Mail Australia. 'She quickly alerted staff and they had a security guide standing 10 metres around it to keep an eye on it because they didn't know what type of snake it was. 'When I arrived, it wasn't causing any trouble, especially when I untangled it from the trolley.' As the weather begins to drop to cooler temperatures in Queensland, Mr Gilbert said brown tree snakes are nocturnal so they try to hide in warm areas. 'They usually try to find somewhere warm to sleep,' he said. 'It probably wanted to stay away from trouble and thought the trolleys were a good place to climb inside and hang there - it had no idea it was a trolley. Mr Gilbert later joked on his Facebook page: 'I told the snake to next time try coming through the delivery door out back. Haha.' The brown treet snake was safely removed from the trolley after it had a little adventure up an escalator . While brown tree snakes are known to kill their prey by chewing to inject venom, Mr Gilbert said they are not regarded as dangerous to humans. 'They're mildly venomous and I still don't advise anyone to pick it up,' Mr Gilbert said. 'Brown tree snakes are not a threat and won't react in a threatening way but if you do get bitten, a pressure bandage should be applied and seek medical attention - as a precaution as with all suspected snake bites. 'We had one situation where a dad thought it was a good idea to catch a snake inside his house and give it to his seven-year-old daughter to play with the next day because he thought it was harmless. 'Even though she was bitten and didn't show any signs of venom - I still advised him to take her to the hospital as a precautionary measure. 'But please, if you're not 100 percent certain about a snake - don't do what this person did.' Mr Richie said while they release venom on its prey, the snakes are not regarded as dangerous to humans . Mr Gilbert said brown tree snakes are harmless and nocturnal, so they try to hide in warm areas . When it doubt about spotting a snake, Mr Gilbert suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance. 'Send it to us and we can identify it for you and if it’s venomous or not - or whether we need to come out to catch it ourselves and relocate them,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'If the snake is found inside a home in one of the rooms, it's best to close the room and pop a towel underneath the door and then call us - nothing worse than having someone run out and lock their entire house and then tell us that ""the snake is somewhere inside the house"". 'If you're in the garden and you step on a snake and it's in between your legs, just stand still because it'll eventually slither away. ‘Be smart about it because 90 percent of the time, people who are bitten are often trying to kill it or scare it away. ‘All snakes want to do is get away but if it doesn’t feel it can escape, it’ll strike – so be sensible when you spot them.’","A woman discovered a tree snake curled up inside a shopping trolley .

"Most brides spend months searching for the perfect accessories on their big day - but a knee-high cast and NHS-issue crutches aren't exactly on the list. However, Kimberley Donoghue, 28, from Ponthenri near Carmarthen, was forced to hobble down the aisle after breaking her leg and a bone in her foot just four days before her wedding. Wearing the heavy white cast beneath her fairy tale dress, her father wheeled her into church and she sat down to say her vows.

"A woman who has undergone  15 separate brain operations has slammed  Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson after falling for her fake cancer survival story. Ashton Taylor, 21, from Perth, who was diagnosed with a severe brain condition called dural arteriovenous fistula in July 2013, said not even an apology from Gibson would cut it for her. Her comments follow the admission from the lying health guru and wellness blogger that she had made up her story about having brain cancer. ‘How dare you stand up on national television and say you've changed your lifestyle and survived a brain tumour?’ Miss Taylor said of Gibson to Daily Mail Australia.

The Whole Pantry gained media attention because of Gibson's remarkable story about cancer survival . ‘My family has had it pretty tough and they've worked hard to keep it together but for you to come in and take away millions of dollars from people is just disgusting. ‘I don't think she'll ever redeem herself. A simple sorry will not cut it.’ Gibson, whose Whole Pantry app was downloaded by more than 300,000 people, triggered international outrage when it emerged she had failed to pass on donations to various charities. ‘I thought if she could do it then I could do it too,' Miss Taylor said. ‘At first I was sceptical about the app but Belle seemed to have gone through so much. 'Even though my brain condition was more severe – I thought the app would be good so I wanted to take a shot and see how things go. I even used some of the recipes in an attempt to help improve my health. ‘But after reading the article, I'm infuriated beyond belief. She needs to refund everyone who ever bought her app and believed her lies. 'It's people’s lives she’s meddling with and she gave us so much hope.’ Miss Taylor, who is studying a degree in communications and marketing, has undergone 15 brain surgeries, numerous angiograms, hundreds of blood tests and several MRI scans in two years.

"A nursing assistant stuffed a wet wipe into 96-year-old Phyllis Hadlow's (pictured) mouth to silence the dementia patient's screams . A hospital nursing assistant stuffed a wet wipe into a 96-year-old woman's mouth to stop her screaming. Deborah Roberts, 53, forced the tissue into Phyllis Hadlow's mouth in an attempt to silence her in front of other nursing staff at Kent and Canterbury Hospital. She also poured water over the dementia patient, telling other staff: 'My son said if they do it to you, you can do it to them.' A court heard how Roberts, 53, mistreated Mrs Hadlow when the elderly widow was being treated at the hospital. Roberts was found guilty of one count of ill-treatment or wilful neglect of a person without capacity following a two-day trial - but avoided a prison sentence. Mrs Hadlow, who has since died, needed extensive medical care and would occasionally lash out and shout, Canterbury Magistrates' Court was told. Staff nurse Janet Nelson said she heard screaming coming from her bed and went to investigate, only to see Roberts shove the wet wipe into the elderly woman's mouth. Roberts told her she did it to stop the patient screaming and Mrs Nelson  told her: 'I don't want to see this again.' In a separate incident, Mrs Hadlow threw water at Roberts so she retaliated by filling a plastic cup with water and pouring some on her head. Healthcare assistant Lisa Ross said Roberts told her: 'I have had enough of this. My son said if they do it to you, you can do it to them.' Roger Davies, defending, said Roberts had wrecked a lifelong career and was now unemployable as a nursing assistant. Roberts, who worked at Kent & Canterbury Hospital, also poured water over the elderly widow, telling other staff: 'My son said if they do it to you, you can do it to them.' He said: 'She didn't think about the consequences of her actions. She will be reminded every week of what she has done and the price she has paid.' Roberts, from Deal, Kent was suspended after the incident in October 2013 and then sacked. Julie Pearce, chief nurse and director of quality for East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We are very sorry for the care Mrs Hadlow received whilst in our hospital and for the distress this would have caused to herself and her family. 'As soon as we were made aware of these allegations in October 2013 we suspended Mrs Roberts, referred the incident to the police and subsequently dismissed her following a disciplinary hearing.' Mrs Hadlow's son, Dennis, 71, who was too upset to face sitting through the trial, said: 'We know people with advanced dementia can be difficult to handle but the staff are supposed to be trained. 'I am glad the witnesses who saw what happened had the courage to speak out. 'We were told the sentence was one step below being sent to prison, but it will also have ended her career.' Roberts was given a one-year community order, which includes 120 hours of unpaid work, and was ordered to pay £750 costs.","Nurse Deborah Roberts forced a wet wipe into Phyllis Hadlow's mouth .

"A Labour parliamentary candidate says she felt no shame in accepting a £1,000 donation from Tony Blair, despite campaigning heavily against the Iraq War. Rupa Huq, who is standing for Ed Miliband’s party in a key marginal seat in west London, said fellow candidates who had turned down the cash were ‘sticking their noses up’ at Mr Blair. Ms Huq - the sister of former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq - even accused MailOnline of ‘picking on her’ when she was quizzed about the donation at a hustings debate last night. Labour parliamentary candidate Rupa Huq (left) says she felt no shame in accepting a £1,000 donation from Tony Blair, despite campaigning heavily against the Iraq War . Mr Blair made £1,000 donations to 106 local campaigns in target seats across the country in March, only for some Labour candidates to reject the money, with one saying she could not accept the money because of her moral objections to the Iraq War. University lecturer Ms Huq, who is running to be MP for Ealing Central and Acton, actively campaigned against the war, boasting about the fact on a page of pledges on her website - but has not returned the money to Mr Blair. When asked whether she felt any shame for accepting the money from the Prime Minister that led Britain into war, she said she was ‘not in a position’ to be able to return the cash. She said: ‘He gave the donation to all the key seats. What we want to do is defeat the Conservative government, the Conservative government that has closed A&Es. ‘He wrote a cheque for £1,000 to the Labour Party, to 106 key seats in the whole country, and I think three people stuck their noses up. ‘But elections cost money, if he gives money to good causes then why not? ‘Tony Blair won three elections, maybe you’re too young to remember. You know what, elections cost money. And he’s the most successful Labour Prime Minister that we have ever had in our country.’ Rupa Huq (pictured, right, campaigning with Eddie Izzard, left) said fellow candidates who had turned down the cash were ‘sticking their noses up’ at Mr Blair . Former minister Sally Keeble (left) and the Labour candidate in Dundee Lesley Brennan (right) have rejected Mr Blair's donation . As members of the public at the hustings at West Acton Primary School started to heckle Ms Huq, she could be heard saying: ‘That was a question designed to pick on me.’ In March, three Labour parliamentary candidates turned down their £1,000 donations from Mr Blair. Sophy Gardner, who is standing for the party in Gloucester and served in the Iraq campaign as a Wing Commander, declined the money. She said: ’I have taken a personal decision that given my criticism of the Iraq war, in which I served, it would be hypocritical of me to accept it. ‘Therefore, I can confirm I would decline this money.’ She joined Lesley Brennan, standing in Dundee East, and Sally Keeble, in Northampton North, who both turned the money down. Speaking at the debate last night, Ms Huq’s Lib Dem opponent Jon Ball said her decision was ‘completely hypocritical’. Labour candidate Sophy Gardner, who served in Iraq with the RAF, declined the donation as she thought accepting it would be 'hypocritical' Ms Huq is the sister of former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq (pictured), who is married to columnist Charlie Brooker . He said: ‘Rupa has said that Ed Miliband and Tony Blair are completely different. But at the same time she’s accepting money from Tony Blair. ‘It’s completely hypocritical. Some Labour candidates have refused the money. She isn’t one of the the three [who have rejected the donation].’ The incumbent candidate in Ealing Central and Acton is Conservative Angie Bray, who was not at the debate, however polls suggest the seat could swing in the favour of Labour. Ms Huq is the sister of former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq, who is married to television presenter and columnist Charlie Brooker. In March, former Downing Street spin doctor Alastair Campbell publicly attacked Labour candidates turning down donations from Mr Blair, calling them 'attention-seeking'. Writing on Twitter he said: 'To attention seeking candidates rejected TB money 1. He won more Labour seats than anyone 2. Tories are loaded 3. Do you want to win?'","Labour candidate Rupa Huq accepted £1,000 from Blair earlier this year .

"All of a sudden, it seems that everywhere we turn there are suncream ads and the shops are filled with offers on summer essentials. So should we be making the most of the bargains to restock the bathroom cabinet — or can we ignore the marketing ploys and dig out supplies that have been lurking at the back for years? Alice Smellie asked industry experts to find out if it’s really vital to buy new supplies for summer . . . Scroll down for video . Out-of-date sun lotions may separate and not spread evenly, say experts, meaning you may not be completely covered with vital UV filters, even if the active ingredients in the sun cream remain stable . SUNSCREEN . There can be few of us who haven’t dug out half-full bottles of SPF30 from the previous year or, indeed, many years past, and wondered whether it’s still OK to slather on. But a recent survey revealed that almost three-quarters of UK holidaymakers are at risk of UV exposure because they use out-of-date sun cream. Many experts recommend that we wear sunscreen every day all year round for anti-ageing purposes. Certainly now the weather is heating up, damaging UVA and UVB rays will be stronger. So, can we use old suncreams? ‘Sun cream contains UV filters which fall into two main categories: synthetic or organic filters, which absorb UV light; and mineral or inorganic filters, such as titanium dioxide, which mainly reflect UV light. Frequently, both types are used in combination,’ says Dr Chris Flower of the CTPA (Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association). The issue is that out-of-date lotions may separate and not spread evenly, meaning you may not be completely covered with those vital UV filters, even if the active ingredients remain stable. When it comes to sun cream, experts advise playing it safe and restocking your supllies to ensure skin is properly protected from damaging damaging UVA and UVB rays . Out-of-date lotions are also more likely to cause skin irritations. Ingredient specialist and product developer Tammy Hollis says: ‘Look at how we treat our suncreams — carrying them from sandy beach to sunny bar and air-conditioned hotels. This gives plenty of opportunity for bacteria to breed.’ So experts recommend you don’t use a sun cream beyond the recommended period after opening. This is represented on the packaging with a picture of an open jar and a number of months (usually 12) in most popular brands of sunscreen. Meanwhile, Dr Flower advocates: ‘Chances are it will probably be OK if it’s just over a year old, although older bottles should definitely be binned.’ VERDICT: Play it safe. Restock. AFTER-SUN . In an ideal world none of us would get sunburn, but occasionally we underestimate the heat of the sun. While it can’t reverse the damaging effects of the sun, after-sun contains soothing ingredients such as water, aloe vera and silicones, which evaporate quickly from the skin and cool it down. Dr Flower says: ‘The main effect is to cool and reduce the effect of over-heating and to help avoid skin peeling.’ While after-suns may seem innocuous products, people forget they are applied to vulnerable, damaged skin. For this reason it’s vital that you adhere to the recommendations regarding when you should discard lotions . While after-suns may seem innocuous products, people forget they are applied to vulnerable, damaged skin. For this reason, it’s vital that you adhere to the recommendations regarding when you should discard lotions. ‘Damaged skin may be more prone to developing irritations, allergies or infections anyway,’ says Dr Flower. ‘So the older the after-sun, the more likely it is to contain bacteria. If a pathogenic organism — a disease causing bacteria — was applied to damaged skin, then it’s possible you might develop an infection of the skin.’ VERDICT: Restock. MOSQUITO REPELLENT . No one wants to be the person on holiday who is stung from top to toe, and in tropical countries where malaria is a risk then an effective repellent is vital. But can you keep using the same spray year after year? ‘Insect repellents work in two different ways,’ says Howard Carter, CEO of Incognito mosquito spray and a mosquito bite prevention expert. ‘Many brands use Deet as their active ingredient. This is a neurotoxin which interferes with the mosquito’s nervous system. They become confused and are prevented from biting.’ When it comes to bottles of insect repellent, experts say you're probably ok to use the same bottle for a couple of years, but keep a close eye on the use-by date, especially if travelling to far-flung countries . Howard says that if any bottle of Deet is open it must be replaced after two years because the active ingredient may stop working as effectively. He adds: ‘Be aware that it can corrode through plastic bottles and cause damage to surrounding items.’ He says that those containing natural ingredients such as citronella or bergamot, may only last a year – this is because oil may lose certain components of its scent and potency, though others, including Incognito, can last for up to two years. VERDICT: You’re probably ok for a couple of years, but keep a close eye on the use-by date, especially if travelling to far-flung countries. FAKE TAN . The sun is shining but your legs are as white as the winter snow. Who hasn’t shaken up that bottle of fake tan mousse that’s been lurking at the back of a cupboard for an indeterminate number of years and looked despairingly at the green tinged product that emerges? ‘The DHA which creates the brown colour is a derivative of fermented sugar beet,’ says ingredient expert Tammy Hollis. ‘When it goes on the skin it’s not stimulating melanin production (which is what happens when you’re in the sun), but reacts with proteins on the top layer of skin known as the epidermis to turn brown. Fake tan usually lasts 12 months once opened. The active ingredient DHA is usually in water-based solutions without many preservatives, say experts.  Once it is past its use-by date it oxidises and goes green . ‘This active ingredient is usually in water-based solutions without many preservatives. Once it is past its use-by date it oxidises and goes green. The smell may become slightly metallic or stronger.’ Fake tan usually lasts 12 months once open. VERDICT: If it looks ok, you can probably go ahead. BITE CREAM . This is a medicine cupboard staple which is probably used little more than twice a year, so it can take a long time to finish a tube. ‘Anti-histamine, hydrocortisone bite creams and crotamiton itch creams are the three common forms of treatment for stings and bites,’ says pharmacist Sultan Dajani, spokesperson for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. ‘Once open, these creams will go off more quickly if they aren’t stored properly — they must be in a cool, dark place otherwise bacteria may be introduced or they simply won’t work as well. If you store it properly it will last up to the expiry date, which may be as much as two years.’ VERDICT: Restock as soon as it is out of date, or if it is runnier than normal or smells funny. HAIR COLOUR PROTECTION SPRAY . UV exposure is extremely damaging for coloured hair. Scientists have found large amounts of cysteic acid (usually found in badly permed hair) in the ends of lank locks which had had a great deal of sun exposure. This causes hair to lose strength and snap. Protection in strong sunlight is highly recommended. Most hair protecting sprays recommend you discard after 12 months. Consultant trichologist Iain Sallis. ‘If you store it in a cool dry cupboard with no light they may last longer than 12 months but once the heat and light of sunshine get in, as is likely on holiday, the ingredients will start to degrade more quickly.’ The result is that hair will no longer be protected. VERDICT: If stored away from the light, you don’t need to restock.","Will out-of-date sun lotion protect your skin from sun damage?

"This is the moment two grinning conmen were caught on camera stealing an 80-year-old's savings from a cash machine after tricking him into handing over his bank cards and PIN. The smiling fraudsters were unaware they had been caught by a pin-hole camera in the ATM as they withdrew the pensioner's cash on March 17. The crooked pair had earlier posed as bank staff on the phone and convinced their vulnerable victim his debit cards needed to be recalled for security reasons.

They talked the man into divulging his security details and persuaded him to leave the cards in an envelope on the doorstep of his home in the village of Walsgrave-on-Sowe, Warwickshire, for 'couriers' to collect.

"Militants fighting for Boko Haram in West Africa have released the first images of their terror activities since pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Taken somewhere in the forests of north-eastern Nigeria, the images show the jihadis casually posing in front of the terror group's sinister black and white flag while brandishing assault rifles. The slick photographs carry all the logos and artwork typically seen in official ISIS releases, suggesting the Middle East-based militants have taken full control of Boko Haram propaganda. The release came as Nigerian soldiers backed by warplanes invaded the Islamist's final stronghold in the country - the Sambisa forest - in an effort to finally defeat the six-year-old insurgency. Legion of death: Taken somewhere in the forests of north eastern Nigeria, the images show the Boko Haram jihadis casually posing with assault rifles . Pledged allegiance: A Boko Haram militant casually poses in front of the Islamic State terror group's sinister black and white flag while brandishing an assault rifle . Over the last six years, Boko Haram have killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds in a battle to establish an Islamic caliphate in Nigeria. Earlier this year the group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, released a video saying the group had pledged allegiance to ISIS and would be dropping the name Boko Haram. Instead they now refer to themselves as Wilayat al Sudan al Gharbi, which is commonly translated into English as the 'West African Province' of the Islamic State. Since their ISIS allegiance video earlier in the year, Boko Haram has not released any official propaganda photographs or video footage. Typically ISIS and their affiliates release shocking images of mass executions or the brutal enforcement of Sharia law after similar periods of silence. The fact Boko Haram have returned with little more than a series of group shots and pastoral scenes is perhaps symptomatic of the group's rapid decline in influence over the past months. Influence: The slick photographs carry all the logos and artwork typically seen in official ISIS releases, suggesting the Middle East-based militants have taken full control of Boko Haram propaganda . Preparing for war: The fact Boko Haram have returned with little more than a series of group shots with amateur weapons is perhaps symptomatic of the group's rapid decline in influence over the past months . This morning Nigerian soldiers retreated from Boko Haram's last known stronghold in the country amid concerns the militants had booby-trapped the area before fleeing. Three pro-government vigilantes were killed in the area by a landmine this morning. A vigilante and a security source both confirmed the pullback from the Sambisa forest, a day after an offensive aimed at rooting out the insurgents. A spokesman for the military was not immediately available for comment. 'The soldiers have retreated to Bama because of mines. They had been on the road but that made them vulnerable, so they moved to the bush but there are mines planted there (too),' one soldier, who did not want to be named, revealed. The Sambisa forest, a former colonial game reserve, is about 60 miles from the village of Chibok, from where Boko Haram abducted more than 200 secondary school girls a year ago. 'Three of our boys were killed by a landmine as we progressed into Sambisa. We've suspended going farther,' Muhammad Mungonu, a member of a pro-government vigilante, told Reuters. Boko Haram - which means 'Western education is sinful' - forced the girls to convert to Islam and marry . Horrified: Michelle Obama, holds a piece of paper with the simple message #BringBackOurGirls following Boko Haram's kidnapping of more than 200 secondary school girls in Chibok, Nigeria last year . Protestors marched through Abuja with red tape over their mouths, carrying a poster with pictures of some of the missing girls. It is now a year since more than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants . Muhammadu Buhari said his government will do 'everything in their power' to find and return around 220 missing schoolgirls to their families, as young girl joins the rally outside the Nigerian ministry of education . Intelligence officials believed the girls kidnapped in Chibok are being held in the Sambisa forest, but U.S. reconnaissance drones have so far failed to locate them. Boko Haram controlled an area the size of Belgium at the start of the year, but have since lost much of that ground after a concerted push by militaries from Nigeria and neighbours Chad, Niger and Cameroon in the past two months. Yet they remain a deadly threat to civilians, as illustrated on Friday when they slit the throats of 12 people in northeast Nigeria as the army was trying to evacuate the area around the former Boko Haram headquarters of Gwoza. Failure to crush Boko Haram or protect civilians was one reason President Goodluck Jonathan lost an election on March 28 to Muhammadu Buhari, who has pledged to spare no effort in battling the militants after he is sworn in on May 29. Chadian military source said a joint military operation involving armies from Niger and Cameroon was expected to begin to encircle the Sambisa forest next week. Chadians will go in from the Cameroonian border where they have been massing troops.","Boko Haram jihadis posed for photos somewhere in north-eastern Nigeria .

Francis recently bought an impressive  white Dodge Charger with black trim and will use the car to ferry passengers around Fort Lauderdale when he becomes a certified Uber driver. Uber is one of a number of apps people can use to book and pay for taxi journeys. Launched in 2009 and currently in operation in more than 250 cities across 55 countries, the app makes cities more accessible for people by ‘seamlessly connecting riders to drivers’, according to the company website. The app detects the GPS on a mobile device and finds the nearest available driver. Users can track the vehicle, pay with their phone, and even split the fare with friends using a credit card system.

"Penny Davison, 59, the ex-wife of a professional gambler and racehorse trainer, has launched a bid for a bigger slice of his legacy, claiming he avoided a huge tax bill by dying . The ex-wife of a professional gambler and racehorse trainer has launched a bid for a bigger slice of his legacy, claiming he avoided a huge tax bill by dying. Albert Davison made a fortune by landing a series of six-figure bets on his own horses. When he died, aged 73, he owned a seven-bedroom country estate in Surrey which had been valued at £4.25million. But before he died, in 2011, he and his second wife Penny Ann Davison, 59, fought a bitter battle through the divorce courts for four years over his fortune, before she was awarded just £750,000. A judge found that Mr Davison had squandered millions of his winnings through 'wasteful expenditure' and 'bad decision making.' But now his beautician ex-wife has now appeared back in court, seeking to boost her slice to more than £1million by claiming his death has freed up more of his cash by allowing him to avoid a huge tax bill. Lord Justice Patten, Lord Justice Briggs and Lady Justice King, sitting at London's Appeal Court, heard that the couple met in 1989 and enjoyed a relationship for five years before marrying in 1994. They had two children before separating in 1999. Divorce proceedings were started by Mrs Davison in 2005 and the battle over the division of the matrimonial assets dragged on for four years. Mr Davison had put the family racing stables, and seven-bedroom detached former matrimonial home at Tillingdown Farm, near Woldingham, into a complex structure of offshore companies and trusts and denied that he had any stake in the property. His lawyers argued that the farm into which he had sunk his gambling fortune was all held in trust for Zoe Davison, his daughter from his first marriage, and his two children from his marriage to Mrs Davison. However, divorce judge, Mrs Justice Baron, ordered the trust controlling the farm to pay out a £756,000 lump sum to Mrs Davison. In her ruling, the judge said the divorce had 'a tragically long history' and had run up 'mammoth' legal costs. She said the late Mr Davison was a 'very successful gambler' and 'excellent' trainer in the late 1970s early 1980s. Hawthorne Glen with Albert Davison after winning at Folkestone. Mr Davison made a fortune by landing a series of six-figure bets on his own horses. When he died, aged 73, he owned a seven-bedroom country estate in Surrey which had been valued at £4.25million . 'I found the husband to be a charming rogue. I liked him', the judge said, but added: 'Despite that I consider that he is a shrewd and manipulative individual who told me many untruths. 'His habitual modus operandi is to ignore authority and do things his way and on his terms'. She also dubbed Mr Davison 'a master of the betting coup', saying that, in December 1978, a gamble at Leicester was alleged to have netted him the equivalent of £1m in today's money. 'There were other six-figure betting coups and he became notorious as a successful punter', she said. The judge said Zoe, also a racehorse trainer, was 'a devoted daughter who was very supportive of her father', who had been generous to her, assisting her with money and advice. Mrs Davison she described as 'bright and amusing' and 'a resourceful woman'. However the judge limited her payout because her ex-husband faced multi-million-pound tax demands and had devalued the property by over £1m by allowing its use for illegal tipping. Mr Davison had put the family racing stables, and seven-bedroom detached former matrimonial home at Tillingdown Farm, near Woldingham, (pictured) into a complex structure of offshore companies and trusts and denied that he had any stake in the property . His lawyers argued that the farm (pictured) into which he had sunk his gambling fortune was all held in trust for Zoe Davison, his daughter from his first marriage, and his two children from his marriage to Mrs Davison . Lynsey Cade-Davies, for Mrs Davison, today told the Appeal Court that the gambler's death had massively reduced his tax liability. She told the judges that a deal had been done with HMRC by one of the companies controlling the dead man's fortune, which had reduced a £2m-plus tax demand to just £850,000. She argued that meant his ex-wife was entitled to an 'uplift' in her lump sum of up to £260,000, taking her payout above the £1m mark. Lawyers representing the trusts which hold the dead man's wealth, told the judges that the property was sold to new owners in 2013 for £3.1m. But they said that only £200,000 now remains in the fund after his debts - including the payout to his wife - had been covered. In an angry outburst outside court, Zoe Davison, who is not a party to the case, accused her former step-mother of trying to mine out the last remains of her inheritance from her father. The mother of four, who runs training stables near East Grinstead, in East Sussex, told Mrs Davison and her lawyers: 'That's all I've got left now, a measly £200,000. 'I hope you people are proud of yourselves.' The judges reserved their decision on Mrs Davison's appeal, to be delivered at a later date, yet to be set.","Albert Davison made a fortune through six-figure bets on his own horses .

"An police officer who rammed his police car into a suspect told investigators it was either 'shoot him or run him over.' Shocking dash cam footage emerged last week which showed Marana police officer Michael Rapiejko mounting the curb and mowing down armed robbery suspect Mario Valencia. The video sparked fierce debate on the use of deadly force with some accusing him of misconduct and others labeling the cop as a hero. Scroll down for video . Deliberate act: Valencia (pictured, left, in his mug shot) remained in hospital for two days before being booked into jail. Police have since spoken out in defense of Rapiejko's actions in the town of Marana, Arizona . But officer Rapiejko said that Valencia had left him with no other choice than to use potentially lethal force, according to a recording obtained by NBC station KVOA. 'He's refused commands, he's holding what I believe to be a locked and loaded rifle,' said Rapiejko in the inquiry recording, who had also warned there were two officers on the street and business nearby. 'This is what I deem at this point to be a lethal force encounter.' 'I have two thoughts that go in my mind, I need to shoot him to stop the threat or I need to run him over to stop the threat.' Rapiejko said he had slammed his patrol car into  Valencia after he allegedly fired a shot from a rifle into the air and was walking towards other officers in Marana, northwest of Tucson, Arizona on February 19. Target: The police officer in the other vehicle warns  Rapiejko that the suspect is loaded and tells him to 'stand off'. But in apparent defiance of his advice, Rapiejo drives straight toward unsuspecting Valencia (pictured) Horrific: Seconds later, Rapiejo's vehicle mounts the curb (pictured) and smashes into the suspect's body . Hit: In this screen grab, from the dashcam video, Valenica appears to turn toward the car as it strikes him . In the inquiry recording he added that he was 50 yards away from Valencia, and felt that was too great a distance to safely take a shot. In the two videos, recorded on dash cams in Rapiejko's and another police officer's car, Valencia is captured walking along the street carrying the weapon. He then points the loaded weapon into the air and a shot rings out. A police officer in one of the patrol cars says: 'One round just went out. He's definitely loaded.' He then tells his colleague, Officer Michael Rapiejko, in the other vehicle: 'Stand off, the gun is loaded.' But apparently ignoring his advice, Rapiejko overtakes the officer's car, before speeding straight toward Valencia. Seconds later, his vehicle mounts the curb and smashes into the suspect's body. Valencia is sent flying into the air, while the car crashes through a concrete wall before coming to a halt amid debris. The other officer can be heard shouting in shock: 'Oh! Jesus Christ, man down.' At the end of the footage, obtained by KOLD, Rapiejko is captured emerging from his vehicle and approaching Valencia, while other cops exit their own cars with their guns raised. Valencia was rushed to University of Arizona Medical Center in serious condition following the crash outside a self storage facility. He was eventually booked into jail two days later. Smash: Valencia is sent flying into the air, while the car crashes through a concrete wall (pictured) before coming to a halt amid debris. The other cop can be heard shouting in shock: 'Oh! Jesus Christ, man down' High-speed: Bits of concrete can be seen sailing through the sky as Rapiejko's patrol car continues traveling . He faces charges that include armed robbery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, arson, burglary and theft. Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen Metzger, has called the incident an excessive use of police force, and said it was clear that Valencia was suicidal. Local police chief Terry Rozema has since spoken out to defend his officer and argue that deadly force was necessary. Speaking to CNN, Rozema was asked if Officer Michael Rapiejko was fortunate not to kill suspect Mario Valencia, 36. 'That very well may be... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,' Rozema said. 'So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,' the chief added. Pozema argued that Rapiejko may actually have saved Valencia's life because we don't know what he would have done next. Cracked: Valencia, was rushed to University of Arizona Medical Center in a serious condition following the crash outside a self storage facility on February 19. Above, Rapiejko's car window appears to be cracked . Another view: Despite the shocking footage of the crash, Marana Police Chief Terry Rozema has defended Officer Rapiejko's actions. Above, this dashcam video was taken from inside the other officer's car . 'We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,' Rozema said. 'And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?' Rapiejko was cleared by the prosecutor's office and returned to work after a three-day leave, police said. An administrative review is underway. In February, Sergeant Chris Warren also appeared to support the deliberate crash, telling KOLD that Valencia 'was a dangerous felon who'd been on a crime spree throughout the morning'. This crime spree allegedly involved theft at a convenience store at Columbus Avenue and 29th Street, vandalism and burglary at the Tucson Baptist Temple, a home invasion and theft of a car. It culminated in the alleged theft of a rifle from Walmart at 8280 North Cortaro Road. From there, the suspect fled to 5650 West Coca Cola Place, where he was struck and injured by Rapiejko's vehicle. Swerving: The second video shows Rapiejko's car swerving across the road and heading toward Valencia . Life-saving? The vehicle smashes into the suspect (the black shape in the air, between the tree and the car) Apprehended: At the end of the footage, obtained by CBS affiliate KOLD-TV, Rapiejko can be seen emerging from his vehicle and approaching Valencia (under the tree), while other cops emerge with their guns raised . 'He'd just stolen a weapon, loaded it, was not obeying commands from officers and walking toward occupied businesses. It's a busy time of morning, a lot of employees at work,' said Sgt Warren. 'We had to take immediate action and make sure he didn't get inside those businesses.' Rapiejko was put on standard administrative leave after the crash, because it was considered use of force. However, the Pima County Attorney's Office cleared the officer of any wrongdoing and he is back on the force, Sgt Warren said. Valencia, meanwhile, is facing several felony charges for his 'spree'. Valencia had already been approached by police near a post office following the alleged Walmart theft, it is reported. There, he had apparently threatened suicide, before firing the gun and fleeing.

This is the third litter sired by 11-year-old, Foli, since 2012. Gestation for tigers is about three-and-a-half months which means the cubs were conceived just weeks before Foli left for another facility in Kansas on February 25. He has been retired from breeding.

"Hillary Clinton's newborn presidential campaign is reeling from new financial links between her family foundation and companies that benefited from her stewardship of the U.S. State Department. On a day when a new Quinnipiac University poll found only 38 per cent of Americans believe she is honest and trustworthy, the leading Democratic Party candidate for president has a mess to clean up. Part of it will involve the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation re-filing some of its annual tax returns to correct errors in how it has reported income from foreign governments. The murky picture also includes tens of millions of dollars Bill Clinton collected in speaking fees from companies that saw their fortunes rise because of U.S. State Department actions while his wife ran the agency. Scroll down for video . Hillary Clinton (seen Wednesday at Georgetown University) was helping approve Russia's purchase of US uranium production as her foundation received millions from executives tied to the deal . Former president Bill Clinton (left) received $500,000 for a Moscow speaking engagement with Renaissance Capital. He also met Vladimir Putin (right), at the time Russia's prime minister, during the visit . In one case a foundation run by the chairman of Uranium One, a nuclear energy company tied to Russia, gave the Clintons' family philanthropy millions while Hillary's State Department gave its stamp of approval to the company's purchase of U.S. uranium. The Russian state atomic agency Rosatom purchased a majority stake in the Vancouver-based company in a years-long process that unfolded from 2009 to 2013 – the same years Mrs. Clinton was America's secretary of state. The executive, Ian Telfer, gave the Clinton Foundation $2.35 million during the same time through his family's Fernwood Foundation. Bill Clinton, the former U.S. president, also received one of his highest speaking fees, $500,000, in June 2010 in Moscow for addressing an investment bank linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin. He earned more than $100 million for his speeches from 2001 to 2013. That number comes from financial disclosure statements filed by Hillary when she was a U.S. senator and, later, secretary of state. Canadian businessman Ian Telfer was only shown as having donated $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation, though tax records reveal that his foundation gave millions when his company was being sold to Russia . An investigation by The New York Times uncovered the connections, based on interviews and public records in Canada, the U.S. and Russia. Chelsea Clinton, the former first daughter whose name is now part of the Clinton Foundation's official moniker, defended the philanthropy on Thursday in New York City. The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation does 'important' work and is 'among the most transparent' of foundations, she claimed during a panel discussion at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'What the Clinton Foundation has said is that we will be even more transparent, even though Transparency International and others have said we're among the most transparent of foundations,' Chelsea, the foundation's vice chair, said. 'I very much believe that that is the right policy. That we'll be even more transparent. That to eliminate any questions while we're in this time, we won't take new government funding, but that the work will continue as it is.' Accepting funds from companies tied to foreign governments presents the appearance of a conflict of interest for the Clinton Foundation, since it's one avenue through which countries could try to influence Hillary and extract sweetheart deals from Washington. The foundation is also under fire for handing the Internal Revenue Service incomplete or incorrect accounting of how much money it received from foreign governments. Chelsea Clinton defended her family philanthropy on Thursday in New York, calling it 'among the most transparent of foundations' Reuters reported on Thursday that the Clinton Foundation and its associated charities will re-file at least five annual tax returns to correct the mistakes. The errors involve under-reporting, over-reporting or misclassifying millions of dollars in donations from foreign governments. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, according to Reuters, the Clinton . Foundation reported to the IRS that it received zero dollars from foreign and U.S. governments. That number stood out because it reported tens of millions in foreign government contributions . in the preceding years. PRESSURE: Likely Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina slammed the Clintons for 'making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep' Foreign governments had continued to give tens of millions . of dollars toward the foundation's work on climate change and . economic development. The foundation listed the donors on its publicly available donor lists, but omitted them in its tax filings. Hillary Clinton is seeing a flurry of new scrutiny applied to her years as secretary of state now that she has announced a 2016 presidential run. Her chief female Republican rival, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, said Thursday that alleged links between the Clinton Foundation, former president Bill Clinton's speaking fees and Mrs. Clinton's leadership at State are disturbing. 'It's the Clinton way: raking in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors while making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep,' Fiorina said in a statement. 'Now they're scrambling to refile their taxes and account for her decisions as Secretary of State.' The Russian uranium story is one piece of a larger puzzle. When Rosatom purchased 51 per cent of Uranium One, which controls a reported one-fifth of the uranium made in the US, the reported $610 million sale needed to be approved by a committee of government agencies, including the State Department. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States approved the majority ownership deal in 2010. Jose Fernandez, a former assistant secretary of state, was the principal State Department representative on the committee, and said that Clinton did not intervene with his work. No one 'has ever produced a shred of evidence supporting the theory that Hillary Clinton ever took action as secretary of state to support the interests of donors to the Clinton Foundation,' according to foundation spokesman Brian Fallon. The Clinton Foundation has become lucrative for one of America's most powerful political families, with Bill Clinton receiving $26 million in speaking fees from donors to the charity. Above, Clinton speaks in January . Approval of Uranium One's sale helped Russian state nuclear agency Rosatom gain control of uranium assets in the US and Kazakhstan (pictured) He said that is was 'utterly baseless' to say that Clinton helped push the deal through while her foundation received a windfall in donations. When Clinton joined the Obama Administration as Secretary of State, she signed an agreement saying that the Clinton Foundation would not receive money from foreign governments and disclose all donors. However, the donations from Uranium One's Telfer reveal that it was still accepting undisclosed donations from private individuals whose businesses and interests aligned with governments such as Russia or businesses. Sixty companies that lobbied the State Department when Hillary Clinton was Secretary donated $26 million to the foundation, at the time run by her husband, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Clinton Foundation only reported that Telfer gave it $250,000, though tax records reviewed by The New York Times show that Telfer's Fernwood Foundation gave $1 million in 2009, $250,000 in 2010, $600,000 in 2011 and $500,000 in 2012. Telfer said that his donations were to support his friend Frank Giustra, who has deep ties to the Clintons and once benefited from Bill's presence on a business trip to Kazakhstan. Up to $5.6 million may have come from other individuals associated with Uranium One. The revelations about possible connections between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary's work in the State Department come as more information has been gathered about how the charity lined the pockets of one of America's most powerful political families. Bill Clinton has made a total of $26 million in speakers fees from donors to the Clinton Foundation, according to a report in The Washington Post. The former president has received more than $100 million in speaking fees since leaving office, though how much of that was from organizations that also donated to his foundation has not previously been known. Some of the biggest donors to the foundation are financial institutions Goldman Sachs, Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup, which personally paid Bill Clinton $3 million in speaking fees. Then-senator Hillary Clinton listens to a briefing from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the organization where she would later help approve Russia's purchase of US uranium assets . Bill Clinton's trip to Kazakhstan and its president Nursultan Nazarbayev (pictured) helped paved the way for a major foundation donor Frank Giustra to start a booming uranium business there . Canadian businessman Frank Giustra (right) got a sweetheart uranium mining deal from Nazarbayev in 2008 with Clinton's help, a year after launching a 'sustainable development initiative' with the Clinton Foundation; Giustra pledged $100 million and half his earnings from mining to the foundation . His June 2010 speech to leading Russian officials at an event for Renaissance Capital netted him $500,000. Clinton met with Vladimir Putin, at the time Russia's Prime Minister, during his visit. All of the business dealings linked to the Clinton Foundation took place during the Obama Administration's 'reset' in US relations with Russia. Bill Clinton also engaged in activities in the post-Soviet world not directly tied to his foundation. In 2005 he flew to Kazakhstan with a Canadian uranium mining financier Frank Giustra and met the country's despotic president Nursultan Nazarbayev. Clinton's appearance is seen as helping Giustra secure a deal to start his UrAsia uranium company in Kazakhstan, which would later merge with Uranium One. Giustra would donate $31.3 million to the Clinton Foundation in 2006 and helped start the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative. Russia would ultimately benefit from the deal and Clinton's involvement, and was able to secure more uranium production in its own backyard when took majority control of Uranium One in 2010 and 100 per cent control in 2013. Rosatom said that it would not export any of the uranium out of the United States, though a rancher at the nuclear material facility in Wyoming said that the uranium is often taken for processing in Canada. News of the Clinton Foundation's ties to uranium executives comes after criticism of the Clinton's ties to additional Eastern European money, from the Ukrainian oligarch that became one of their foundation's biggest donors. Victor Pinchuk, the fourth richest man in Ukraine, was found to have done business with Iranian government despite US sanctions against the Middle Eastern country when he sold their oil and gas pipes in 2011 and 2012, according to Newsweek. Many of the recent revelations have come from a book called 'Clinton Cash', written by investigative journalist Peter Schweizer. Supporters of Hillary Clinton's fledgling presidential campaign say that the book is a partisan conservative attack. A spokesman for the campaign said that the Uranium One deal went through the normal approval process and that Schweizer's book is 'twisting previously known facts into absurd conspiracy theories.' The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States also includes representatives from most large arms of government, such as the Justice Department, Department of Commerce and Department of Defense.","Hillary Clinton seen as honest and trustworthy by just 38 per cent of Americans, new poll shows .

"After his grandfather passed away when he was just 12-years-old, Brendan Cordina resigned himself to the fact that his beloved World War II medals were gone forever. After searching far and wide for two years, the 36-year-old amazingly found the medals in the Northern Territory and drove over 3500 kilometres in four days to be reunited with the family treasures. But on his arrival at the Darwin Military Museum, Mr Cordina was refused the medals and told that they 'were more important to the museum.' Medals include an Airforce Cross, War Medal 39-45 Star, a Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal and others . Brendan Cordina (pictured here with his son Zac) drove for four days to find his grandfather's medals . 'I searched for years and really thought they were lost forever,' Mr Cordina told Daily Mail Australia. 'I started by ringing around RSL's asking if anyone had heard of flight lieutenant Captain Jack Slade.' Mr Cordina then began a national search and found clues that brought him to Darwin after two years of searching. 'After confirming that we had found the medals, we put it to the museum board,' he said. 'It took time to get an answer, but museum Director Pierre Akin responded saying that ""the medals are more important to us and they're going to stay here.'"" The museum instead offered to send Mr Cordina replicas to which he was  outraged. 'I was disgusted about it,' he said. 'It's the sentimentality, if they put replicas in the museum, the public would not know the difference, but I do.' After posting the rejection letter he received on Facebook, Mr Cordina saw the messages of support and decided to start a petition on change.org. 'I never for a moment imagined our family would be left begging for his bravery to be respected – yet unbelievably, that's exactly what NT Museums has done, rejecting our plea for his service medals to be returned,' the petition reads. Captain Jack Slade was a flight lieutenant in World War II and received many distinguished service medals . He has received of 15,000 signatures in under 24 hours and is overwhelmed by the public's support. 'I’m humbled and honoured that people are siding with what’s right,' he said. The medals for Mr Slade's service included the distinguished Airforce Cross, an order of the British Empire, a War Medal 39-45 Star, a Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal among various others. But Mr Cordina's biggest regret is that his ill mother will not get to see her father's medals again. 'She can barely make it to the front door, let alone Darwin,' he said. 'She'll never see them again if we can't get them home.' The Director of the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, Pierre Arpin understands that the family are emotionally tied to these items, but said he has respected the intent of the donor. The donor was Mr Slade's wife, Mel Slade, who has also since passed away. 'Joyce Maden, who is the executrix of the will called us and confirmed that it was very clearly in his will,' Mr Arpin told Daily Mail Australia. Director of MAGNT, Pierre Arpin, said he respected the intent of the donor to have medals benefit the public . 'Both of them detailed what their intent was and it was to have the medals at the museum benefiting the public.' Mr Arpin said that after Mrs Slade's death, it took a year for the museum to receive an offer of donation as it went through the board for a long period. 'A note from Mel Slade herself says, ""let me put these things where they should be because that respects my husband’s wishes,""' Mr Arpin said. Mr Cordina said he never knew about the will as his family did not have a relationship with Mr Slade's second wife. 'I only found out about this last night as it was never mentioned to me, not even my emailing back and forth with the museum,' Mr Cordina said. 'I'm still beside myself why this is coming to light now.' Mr Cordina is still hoping for the museum to override the board's decision. 'If anything were to ever happen I'd give them back to them,' he said. 'I'd just love for the museum to have a heart and hand them back.'","Brendan Cordina found his granddad's WWII medals at a NT museum .

"A teenager who was dragged from a bus stop and brutally raped has broken her silence in a bid to catch the man who tried to murder her in the horrific attack. The 18-year-old was hit over the head 20 times with a rock and dragged into a garden where she was raped by the man and left for dead in the Beeston area of Leeds last month. The unidentified victim will speak out in tonight's episode of Crimewatch in which she tells reporters she is too scared to sleep for fear of reliving the ordeal in her dreams. West Yorkshire police have released a new e-fit of an attacker who left a teenager for dead after a savage attack at a bus stop. The unidentified victim will speak out in tonight's episode of Crimewatch in which she tells reporters she is too scared to sleep for fear of reliving the ordeal in her dreams . In the programme, she describes how she was waiting for the bus home in the Beeston area of Leeds last month. She was grabbed by the man, who is still at large, and pushed into the garden. There she was bludgeoned several times over the head with a large stone before being raped and left for dead . In the programme, she describes waiting for the bus home when she was grabbed by the man, who is still at large, and pushed into the garden. There she was bludgeoned several times over the head with a large stone before being raped and left for dead. The victim told Crimewatch: 'Then it was getting dark. I went to the bus stop. I was waiting for a bus to go home. 'I haven't been able to stop thinking about what happened. I've stopped sleeping because I can see what happened when I am trying to sleep.' He is described as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, in his early twenties and slim with a receding hairline. West Yorkshire Police are treating the crime as a rape and attempted murder, and are scouring the area for clues as to his whereabouts. This is the blood-stained rock used by a rapist to hit his 18-year-old victim over the head 20 times before sexually assaulting her in a harrowing attack . A map showing the areas of Leeds, where the rapist had been stalking women on the night of the attack . CCTV from earlier the same evening on March 6 shows a man of the same description stalking three other women elsewhere in the city. The force have since released a new e-fit of the attacker, based on the victim's description. The morphed image uses the previous e-fit and the description given by one of the women he was caught following. Detective Superintendent Nick Wallen said: 'We believe this new image is the most realistic likeness we have yet had of the man we are still working very hard to identify. 'It has been created from the victim's description of him and from the recollection of one of the women he stalked in the period leading up to the attack. 'I would ask people to study it very closely alongside the other elements of description that we have already released and think hard about whether they know who it is.' In a graphic CCTV sequence the man is seen dragging the woman from the bus stop and into a garden to rape her . This chilling footage was released by West Yorkshire Police in a bid to trace the man who is wanted for rape and attempted murder .

The reconstruction, which airs on Crimewatch at 9pm, will include information from the victim's police interviews and comments made as she tries to recover from her ordeal. Det Supt Wallen added: 'This was an appalling attack on a young woman where a shocking level of violence was used which could so easily have had fatal consequences. 'It has understandably had a very significant traumatic effect on the victim and that clearly comes across in the emotive comments she has made which feature in tonight's Crimewatch programme. 'We are very grateful to the local and national media for all the support they have given our ongoing appeals over the last seven weeks. 'Crimewatch is however a particularly prominent platform for the appeal and we are hoping that among its millions of viewers tonight could be someone who has that crucial information that could help us to identify this man.' The detective added: 'We are hopeful that the woman shown being followed, who we have not yet identified, will come forward as a result of this new appeal. 'Although we are now seven weeks into this investi gation, our resolve to catch this man remains as strong as it was on day one. 'We are continuing to conduct a very wide range of enquiries to identify him and would urge anyone who thinks they know who it might be to contact us immediately.' A reward of £5,000 is offered for any information that leads to the rapist's arrest and conviction.

"Barry Bonds has been cleared legally after 11 1/2 years in court. His reputation remains tainted in the mind of many baseball fans. A federal court of appeals threw out the career home run leader's obstruction of justice conviction on Wednesday, ruling 10-1 that his meandering answer before a grand jury in 2003 was not material to the government's investigation into illegal steroids distribution. 'Today's news is something that I have long hoped for,' Bonds said in a statement. Overturned: In this April 13, 2011, file photo, former baseball player Barry Bonds leaves federal court in San Francisco, after being found guilty of one count of obstruction of justice . On April 22, 2015, reversed the sole conviction against baseball slugger Barry Bonds, pictured in 2011, and said he could not be tried again on an obstruction of justice charge that resulted from a steroids probe . 'I am humbled and truly thankful for the outcome as well as the opportunity our judicial system affords to all individuals to seek justice.' Now 50, Bonds said 'I am excited about what the future holds for me as I embark on the next chapter.' Bonds broke Hank Aaron's long-standing career record of 755 homers in 2007, finished that season with 762 and was indicted that December for his testimony before a grand jury investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, when he answered a question about injections by saying he was 'a celebrity child.' He was convicted of the obstruction charge in 2011, and a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the conviction in 2013. But the larger group, which listened to arguments from prosecutors and Bonds' lawyers last September, concluded there was insufficient evidence his initial evasive answer was material to the grand jury's probe. 'The most one can say about this statement is that it was non-responsive and thereby impeded the investigation to a small degree by wasting the grand jury's time and trying the prosecutors' patience,' Judge Alex Kozinski wrote. baseball player: Pittsburgh Pirates Barry Bonds sits in the dugout at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium before his first major league start against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Pittsburgh, May 30, 1986 . 'Real-life witness examinations, unlike those in movies and on television, invariably are littered with non-responsive and irrelevant answers.' Jessica Wolfram, one of the jurors who convicted Bonds following the three-week trial and four days of deliberations, said she couldn't help but feel the decade-long prosecution was 'all a waste, all for nothing.' 'Just a waste of money, having the whole trial and jury,' she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. In testifying before the grand jury, Bonds claimed he didn't realize substances he used were illegal performance-enhancing drugs. The appellate judges based their decision on legal issues involving witness testimony, not the underlying facts. Despite holding the career and season home run marks - he hit a single-year record 73 in 2001 - Bonds has been denied entry into baseball's Hall of Fame by baseball writers. He appeared on 36.8 percent of ballots this year, less than half the 75 percent needed. 'I think sadly his reputation has been tarnished, not because of the indictment or the reversal, but because of all the PED use,' former baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent said. 'I think the public has made up its mind.' Barry Bonds, pictured in 2011, was sentenced to 30 days of home confinement and two years probation after a jury found Barry Bonds guilty on one count of obstruction of justice . Roger Clemens, whose pitching feats were as accomplished as Bonds' batting achievements, also has been denied Hall entry. Clemens was acquitted in 2012 of criminal charges he lied to Congress when he denied using PEDs. Travis Tygart, chief executive officer of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, called the decision ""almost meaningless for the real issue, which is whether he used performance-enhancing drugs to cheat the fans of baseball."" 'I think at the end of the day America knows the truth and who the real home run record holder is, who did it the right way, and it's obviously not Barry Bonds,' he said. Following the trial that opened in March 2011, a jury deadlocked on three counts charging Bonds with making false statements when he denied receiving steroids and human growth hormone from personal trainer Greg Anderson and denied receiving injections from Anderson or his associates. Bonds was convicted for his response when he was asked whether Anderson ever gave him 'anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with.' 'That's what keeps our friendship,' Bonds said. 'I was a celebrity child, not just in baseball by my own instincts. I became a celebrity child with a famous father. I just don't get into other people's business because of my father's situation, you see.' Thumbs up: In this Sept. 6, 2014, file photo, career home run leader Barry Bonds gives a thumbs up while standing behind the batting cage and watching the Houston Astros take batting practice . Judges divided on their rationale, issuing four separate opinions to reverse the conviction and one to uphold it. The appeals court barred a retrial, citing a prohibition on double jeopardy. Kozinski, writing for himself and four other judges, was concerned the obstruction statute, 'stretched to its limits ... poses a significant hazard for everyone involved in our system of justice, because so much of what the adversary process calls for could be construed as obstruction.' Wolfram remembered there being some confusion among the jurors over the fact that Bonds did answer the question later in his grand jury testimony. Bonds did not testify at the trial. Judge Johnnie B. Rawlinson, the only member of the court to back prosecutors, wrote an opinion filled with baseball references that began 'there is no joy in this dissenting judge,' added the judges who sided with Bonds 'have struck out' and concluded 'I cry foul.' The government could ask the 11-judge panel to reconsider Wednesday's decision or could request that all 29 judges on the 9th Circuit rehear the case - which has never happened since the court began using the ""limited en banc"" panels in 1980. Prosecutors also could petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision. 'I could not be more happy that Barry Bonds finally gets to move on with his life,' BALCO founder Victor Conte said. No crime: Former Major League Baseball player Barry Bonds greets a fan as he leaves federal court following a sentencing hearing on December 16, 2011 in San Francisco, California . 'Let's hope the prosecutors choose not to waste any more resources on what has been nothing more than a frivolous trophy-hunt and a complete waste of taxpayer dollars.' A seven-time NL MVP and the son of three-time All-Star Bobby Bonds, Barry Bonds earned $192.8 million from the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants during a professional career from 1985-07 and could afford a legal team that outnumbered the government's 13-5 in the court room. He was sentenced in 2011 by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston to 30 days of home confinement, two years of probation, 250 hours of community service in youth-related activities and a $4,000 fine. He already has served the home confinement. Illston declared a mistrial on the three other counts, and the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco dismissed those charges in August 2011. The U.S. attorney's office declined comment on the decision. 'I think the 10-1 vote indicates that it was a farce,' said Bonds' appellate lawyer, Dennis Riordan. 'The greatest impact is the damage it undid. We had a panel opinion that said if you're asked a question on page 78 and you digress before you answer it directly on page 81, you're a federal felon.' In 2009 and `10, the 9th Circuit ruled federal agents illegally seized urine samples and testing records of major league players, with Kozinski saying it 'was an obvious case of deliberate overreaching by the government.' The 9th Circuit three-judge panel ruled in 2010 the government could not present positive urine samples at Bonds' trial because Anderson refused to testify and there was no witness to authenticate the evidence.","Barry Bonds has been cleared legally after 11 1/2 years in court .

"The Australian Government has won its bid to ban the boss of the nation's biggest bikie gang from Australia after the Federal Court ruled unanimously against Alex Vella re-entering the country. Three Federal Court judges ruled that Vella, 61 - who is regularly described as a millionaire businessman - be prohibited from returning after the government cancelled the Rebels bikie gang president's visa while he was overseas in his native Malta last year. In a judgement obtained by Daily Mail Australia, the court this week ordered Vella, who has painted himself as a Nelson Mandela-like figure and sold stubby holders and t-shirts to fund his legal battle, pay all court costs. The decision strands Vella in Malta, leaving behind in Australia 24 close family members including a wife, sons and an elderly mother, all of whom are Australian citizens. Known as 'the Maltese Falcon', Vella is the longtime boss of the Rebels, which Federal Court documents obtained by Daily Mail Australia say are involved in drug dealing, money laundering, serious assaults, kidnapping, extortion, firearms offences, threatening law enforcement officers and intimidating court witnesses. Scroll down for video . Banned for life: Rebels bikie gang president Alex Vella (left, dressed for court and, right, in bike gear) says he is a God-fearing, law-abiding family man who just likes riding motorcycles. The Federal Court this week banned him from Australia and police say he led a violent gang involved in kidnapping, extortion and drug dealing . Not welcome: Alex Vella (pictured, centre), millionaire businessman and president of the Rebels outlaw motorcycle gang since 1973, has failed to stop the government's  cancellation of his visa while he was overseas, leaving him stranded in Malta and unable to return to his family in Australia . Police identify the Rebels as 'one of Australia's highest risk criminal threats' and say its exiled president Vella 'continues to to exert significant influence' over the group. In this week's court judgement obtained by Daily Mail Australia, Mr Vella claimed the federal immigration minister had 'failed to afford him natural justice'. But new documents released by the Federal Court reveal that the Abbott Government is not required to say why it opposed Vella's application for re-entry, other than cite his association with a criminal enterprise. This week's order to pay the Federal Government's costs in his failed challenge could run into tens of thousands of dollars. Via his Facebook page and a website dubbed 'Aussie at Heart', Vella has been selling T-shirts and other items emblazoned with his likeness and the motto 'Bring Him Home' to fund his court challenge. Asking $25 for a stubby holder, car sticker and key-ring set, Vella used the quote of legendary South African leader Mandela, 'To deny people their human rights is to challenge their very humanity'. It was under former Immigration Minister Scott Morrison that Vella applied last year to re-enter Australia when Morrison cancelled the Rebels president's visa four days after the veteran biker left Australia for Malta. Peter Dutton took over as minister last December. Former Immigration Minister Scott Morrison last year moved swiftly to cancel Rebels boss Alex Vella's visa under  grounds the bikie gang leader was linked to kidnapping, extortion and drug running . The minister's decision relied on detailed intelligence provided by Australian Crime Commission-led Task Force Attero, established in 2012 to 'disrupt, disable and dismantle criminal activities of the Rebels MC - one of Australia's highest risk criminal threats'.. Attero investigators allege that under Vella's leadership the Rebels have engaged in multiple criminal enterprises. It is believed the gang has more than 2000 members across the country. 'The Rebels MC membership in Australia includes a significant number of individuals with criminal convictions,' a court document states. 'Between January 20012 and June 2013, 718 Rebels MC members, nominees and associates were either reported or arrested in relation to 1211 charges for offences ranging from violence related offences (including serious assault, stalking, kidnapping and affray), firearms and weapons offences, drugs offences, and property, street and traffic offences. 'Rebels MC members have used violence in a premeditated manner to discipline Rebels MC members who have been perceived to have breached Rebels MC rules, in disputes with other OMCGs, threaten law enforcement officers, intimidate court witnesses and extort businesses and individuals.' This week's Federal Court judgement states that Alex Vella was born in Malta in 1953, emigrated to Australia aged 14 in 1967 and has been president of the Rebels Motorcycle Club since 1973. He never became an Australian citizen. Mr Vella has a wife, two sons and two stepsons, nine grandchildren, nine siblings and an elderly mother, all of whom are Australian citizens. The judgement said he left Australia for Malta on June 9 last year and on June 12, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection applied to cancel his visa. Rebels president Alex Vella, second from left, has lost his fight against the Australian government's cancellation of his visa to the Federal Court after a legal battle in which he denied heading a criminal organisation . Catering to all budgets: Supporters of Alex Vella's failed fight to come home were offered a stubby holder, car sticker and key ring for $25 or could just make a donation of any size . Minister Morrison did so the following day on the grounds that Vella did not pass the character test by virtue of his association with a group suspected of criminal conduct. Mr Vella challenged the visa revocation via his Australian lawyers and the case landed in the Federal Court. On Tuesday this week, Justices Robert Buchanan, Geoffrey Flick and Michael Wigney of the Federal Court unanimously dismissed Mr Vella's application and ordered he pay costs. Vella, who has repeatedly denied running a criminal organisation, still has the website alexvella.com.au selling selling $50 T-shirts with the Mandela quotes on the back. Show your Support!' the website states. 'Help Alex funding his legal fees by purchasing some of these cool items. (Of course you can also just make a donation without purchasing any items.)' 'Bring Him Home': Supporters of Alex Vella were asked to help fund the Rebels president's legal fight against the cancellation of his visa by buying $50 t-shirts or stubby, car sticker and key ring sets for a mere $25 . 'To deny people their human rights is to challenge their very humanity': Alex Vella quoted Nelson Mandela on the back of t-shirts he was selling as part of the millionaire bikie gang leader's failed bid to be allowed to return to Australia . The Let Alex Vella Return to Australia Facebook page has received more than 26,000 likes. Wayne West wrote on Wednesday: 'I'd rather have a Rebels clubhouse in my street than a mosque...' Tony Hardacre wrote on the page on April 13, 'Been here 47 years what the f*** is going on he is an Australian citizen he should be let back into Australia'. Vella  has regularly returned to Malta since he moved to Australia and was crowned light heavyweight boxing champion of his homeland in 1978. True patriot: Rebels bikie boss Alex Vella said he was not a criminal and just wanted to return to Australia so he could rejoin his family, run his motorcycle club and continue his charitable good works . Sometimes referred to as 'the Maltese Falcon', he has four sons, says he donates generously to charities and is a regular churchgoer. He describes the Rebels as 'family' and a 'brotherhood', not a criminal organisation. 'I have always worked hard and given back to community,' he states on his website. 'I have always voted and paid tax. All I want is to be able to return to my home of 46 years and be reunited with my family.' The Attero task force sees him differently, according to court documents. 'The Rebels MC presents a high threat to the Australian community,' the court documents state. 'This OMCG has demonstrated an ability to increase its geographical influence, diversify across illicit drug markets and launder illicit profits. 'Alessio Emanuel Vella has been the National President of the Rebels MC since 1973. During this 40 years he has overseen the expansion of the OMCG from three original chapters to the largest OMCG in Australia. He has and continues to exert significant influence over the Rebels MC in Australia. 'Mr Vella acknowledges he is the National President of the Rebels MC. He also acknowledges he is aware that several members of the Rebels MC have been involved in criminal activities. 'The fact that Rebels MC members remain members despite criminal convictions including convictions obtained whilst members of the OMCG contradicts Mr Vella's assertions the Rebels MC does not condone criminal activity by its members, and allow them to remain members. 'The Rebels MC have remained cohesive and disciplined through Mr Vella's strong leadership.' The Rebels has expanded from Australia to include international chapters in 20 other countries: Cambodia, Canada, Costa Rica, Croatia, England, Fiji, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Laos, Lebanon, Malta, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Thailand and the USA. The Attero task force comprises all state and territory police forces as well as the Australian Crime Commission, Australian Federal Police, Customs and Border Protection Service, Australian Tax Office, Australian Securities and Investments Commission and Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre.","Rebels bikie gang boss Alex Vella has been stranded in Malta since his visa was cancelled in June last year .

"Plagued by a feeling something wasn't right, student Yamini Karanam sought medical help. She was struggling to understand things she had read, and felt lost in conversations. But the Indiana University PhD student could never have comprehended the source of the problem - an 'evil twin sister growing' in her brain. Surgeons operating to extract what they believed to be a tumour in her brain, were shocked to discover the growth was in fact an embryonic twin, complete with bone, hair and teeth. Yamini Karanam, 26, a student at Indiana University, was diagnosed with a pineal tumour in her brain after noticing she was struggling to comprehend things she had read, and felt lost in conversations . Known by its medical name, a brain teratoma, the growth is very rare. Indeed, Dr Hrayr Shahinian, the expert at the Skullbase Institute in Los Angeles who operated on Miss Karanam, has removed around 7,000 brain tumours and has seen just two teratomas. In the past, teratomas have been reported to contain hair, teeth, bone and rarely more complex organs including eyes, hands, feet and limbs. And in some cases they have been found to resemble a foetus. Miss Karanam first noticed something wasn't right last September, when she struggled to register things in her mind, NBC reported. 'If a couple of people were talking in a room, I wouldn't understand what was happening,' she said. Frustrated at doctors' apparent inability to find an answer, the 26-year-old launched her own search for answers online. It led her to the Skullbase Institute and Dr Shahinian, who has developed a minimally-invasive way of reaching deep into a person's brain to extract tumours. The procedure, he said, is a type of keyhole surgery rather than traditional brain surgery, which involves opening the skull and using metal retractors to allow him to insert a microscope deep into the brain. Instead, Dr Shahinian makes a half-inch incision in the brain to use fibre-optic technology and digital imagery to gently chisel away at the tumour. Shocked when she woke to learn of Dr Shahinian's discovery, Miss Karanam branded the tumour her 'evil twin sister who's been torturing me for the past 26 years'. Dr Shahinian said he feared the tumour could be cancerous. But surgeons operating on the 26-year-old discovered the growth, indicated just above the red dot above, was in fact a teratoma - a growth containing bone, hair and teeth . WHAT ARE TERATOMAS? A teratoma is a tumour with tissue or organ components from more than one different part of the body. They have been reported to contain hair, teeth, bone and rarely more complex organs including eyes, hands, feet and limbs. In some cases a teratoma has been found to resemble a foetus. They are usually benign masses, though some cancerous forms of teratoma are known to exist. Mature teratomas, which are typically benign, are more commonly found in women. Immature teratoma, which are typically cancerous, are more often found in men. They are thought to be present at birth, but are often not discovered until later in life. Teratomas can occur in the testes in men and ovaries in women, as well as the brain, skull, nose, tongue, under the tongue and in the neck. WHAT ARE PINEAL TUMOURS? Pineal tumours are those that affect the pineal gland in the brain. The gland produces the hormone melatonin, which helps control sleeping. There are different types of pineal tumour, their name depending on the kind of cells from which they develop. The majority are germ cell tumours. Different tumours cause different symptoms. They are generally caused by a build-up of fluid in the brain, which leads to increased pressure, or caused the tumour itself. They include: . But tests revealed the mass was benign, and Miss Karanam is expected to make a full recovery in just three weeks. She said she wanted to raise awareness of Dr Shahinian's technique. 'This has to be mainstream,' she added. 'When they know you have a pineal tumour, they should tell you ""you know what? There's a minimally invasive approach in which they won't kill you, they won't leave you with a disability.' Prior to Dr Shahinian's keyhole approach, he said the only option was to remove half of the patient's skull to reach the tumour. He added: 'We want to be in and out without the brain knowing we were there, and I think that's the beauty of this technique.'","Yamini Karanam, 26, was diagnosed with a pineal brain tumour .

"Google launched a new U.S. wireless service today that switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks . Google is already the world’s most popular phone software provider, and a pay-TV operator - and now it wants to be your mobile network carrier. The company has unveiled a U.S. wireless service that switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks to curb data use and keep phone bills low. The service, called 'Project Fi,' debuted today, about two months after Google revealed its plans to expand its ever-growing empire into providing wireless connections for smartphones. Google is selling the basic phone service for $20 a month and will only charge customers for the amount of cellular data that they use each month, instead of a flat rate. Each gigabyte of data will cost $10 a month. That means a customer could sign up for a plan offering three gigabytes of data and get $20 back if only one gigabyte was used in a month. Most wireless phone carriers allow their customers to roll over unused data into another month of service without refunding any money. Project Wi-Fi initially will only be sold to a narrow US audience that owns the Nexus 6, a smartphone that Motorola Mobility made with Google's help. Google's pricing setup makes Project Fi less expensive than most of the comparable plans offering by the four biggest wireless phone carriers - Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. The monthly prices for a single line of smartphone service with up to one gigabyte of cellular data at those carriers range from $45 to $50 compared to $30 from Google. The major carriers, though, offer a variety of family plans that could still be better deals than Project Fi. Those bundled plans allow several phone lines to share a pool of cellular data. Scroll down for video . Besides trying to bring down the prices of wireless phone plans, Google is promising subscribers that their Nexus 6 model will automatically connect with the fastest network available. Rather than building its own network, Google is leasing space on cellular towers built by Sprint and T-Mobile, which are hoping the deals will boost their profits without costing them too many customers tempted to defect to Project Fi. To use the service, Nexus 6 owners must sign-up to request an invitation, must have a Gmail address, and must live in a US zip code within the coverage area. In this map, the dark green areas are covered by the service's 4G LT, the lime green is covered by 3G and the pale green by 2G . Verizon 4G LTE coverage is pictured for comparison. Project Fi will be hosted through Sprint Corp and T-Mobile's networks . The service will work only on the company's Nexus 6 phones and only in the US . Project Fi will be hosted through Sprint Corp and T-Mobile's networks. Overall, it costs $20 for basic service, which includes unlimited domestic talk, unlimited texting, tethering, and access in 120 countries. Customers pay $10 per GB of data. Data is paid for in advance, and the cost of unused data gets refunded rather than rolled over or lost. Phone numbers will live in the cloud so that consumers can talk and text on any connected tablet. Calls can be made via Hangouts on Android, iOS, and through Gmail on desktops, via the Hangouts widget. Texts can be made and received in the same way. There is no annual service contract required when you sign up . To use the service, Nexus 6 owners must sign-up to request an invitation, must have a Gmail address, and must live in a US zip code within the coverage area. Google is promising Project Fi will automatically switch over to an available Wi-Fi network if that is running at a higher speed than the cellular alternatives. T-Mobile CEO John Legere, whose company already has been cutting its prices and rolling out new options, said it was a 'no-brainer' to work with Google on Project Fi. 'Anything that shakes up the industry status quo is a good thing — for both US wireless customers and T-Mobile,' Legere wrote in a blog post. Google has an incentive to promote cheaper and faster wireless service as a mobile virutal network operator. This is because it operates some of the world's most popular online services, including its search engine, maps, Gmail and YouTube video site. The Mountain View, California, company believes most people will visit those services more frequently if they are enticed to stay online for longer periods, giving Google more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue. Similar motives prompted Google to begin building high-speed, hard-wired networks capable of navigating the Internet at speeds up to 100 times faster than existing broadband services. Although Google is only selling its broadband service in a handful of U.S. cities so far, AT&T and Comcast are now offering options with comparable speeds in a few communities. Price in Dollars: This graphic shows how much Google's new Project Fi will cost for various plans. For Talk and Text only, the Google carrier will cost $20 a month as compared to $35 for new partner TMobile. However the savings really start when 5GB of LTE is consider - with the Internet search giant's plan coming in at $70 and telecom giant Verizon's costing $110 a month .

"The Secret Service took more than a year to replace a broken alarm system at the home of George H.W. Bush, it has emerged. The alarm failed at the former president's Houston residence in September 2013 and even though the Secret Service bought a replacement system in January 2014, it took until December  for it to be installed - leaving the couple without the protection of a working alarm at their home for 15 months. It came despite an agent's recommendation in 2010 that the alarm, which was installed in 1993, be replaced because it 'had exceeded its life cycle'. The request was denied for an unknown reason. The oversight - just the latest in a string of blunders by the agency - was revealed in a report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, which was released on Thursday. Concerns: Former First Lady Barbara Bush and former President George H.W. Bush, pictured watching basketball in March, did not have a working alarm at their Houston home for more than a year . During the time the alarm was out of service, the Secret Service assigned an employee to keep watch over the residence, according to the report,CBS News reported. Some inside the agency contended that the agent was not sufficient to replace the alarm system, the Washington Post reported. Despite the apparently relaxed security measures, there were no breaches at the property, where 90-year-old Bush and his wife Barbara have lived for more than two decades. On Twitter on Thursday, Bush said that he and his wife have 'great respect for, and confidence in, the men and women' of the Secret Service. 'That respect and confidence has never waned,' he wrote. Endorsement: In light of the reports, Bush tweeted that he had 'great respect' for the Secret Service . Property: Their Houston home, circle, was guarded by a Secret Service agent throughout the 15 months . The report also raises concerns about the security at other former presidents' homes, but has redacted their names. Among the concerns, one official reported that safety equipment showed 'signs of impending failure'. In January, the Washington Post reported that the alarm system at Vice President Joe Biden's home was failing so agents had simply switched the system off. They were told that budget constraints meant the repairs would have to wait. The new report, which was addressed to Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy, recommended that the agency reviews all security equipment and looks into how it keeps track of maintenance issues. 'With these fixes in place, we believe the Secret Service will more effectively meet its mission to protect the lives and homes of our former presidents,' Homeland Security Inspector General John Roth, who wrote the report, said in a statement. Blunders: A member of the Secret Service patrols outside the White House last September after a man managed to scale the fence, run across the lawn and enter the property without being stopped . Embarrassment: Last week, a man landed a gyrocopter on the U.S. Capitol lawn in the latest embarrassment for security teams in Washington D.C. Pictured, a member of a bomb squad checks out the aircraft . Clancy agreed with the recommendations and said that the Secret Service had launched a review before the investigations. The report's findings are just the latest embarrassment for the Secret Service, which has seen its reputation tarnished by a string of missteps in recent months. Last year, Iraq war veteran Omar Gonzalez scaled the fence of the White House and managed to enter the residence - running right past agents, who also failed to release a dog in time. Earlier this year, two agents drove through an active bomb investigation, and last week, a protester flying a gyrocopter managed to land on the lawn on the U.S. Capitol in D.C.","The alarm system at the former president's Houston property failed around September 2013 but was not replaced until December 2014 .

"Global warming hasn't happened as fast as expected, according to a new study based on 1,000 years of temperature records. The research claims that natural variability in surface temperatures over the course of a decade can account for increases and dips in warming rates. But it adds that these so-called 'climate wiggles' could also, in the future, cause our planet to warm up much faster than anticipated. Scroll down for video . The study compared its results to the most severe emissions scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Projected temperature change from 2081-2100 by the IPCC are pictured here. The latest study, however, says this climate model may be wrong . The study compared its results to the most severe emissions scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 'Based on our analysis, a middle-of-the-road warming scenario is more likely, at least for now,' said Patrick Brown, a doctoral student in climatology at Duke University. 'But this could change.' The Duke-led study says that variability is caused by interactions between the ocean and atmosphere, and other natural factors. They claim these 'wiggles' can slow or speed the rate of warming from decade to decade, and exaggerate or offset the effects of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations. If not properly explained and accounted for, they may skew the reliability of climate models and lead to over-interpretation of short-term temperature trends. Summary of projected changes in crop yields in a previous IPCC report. Because 'climate wiggles' were not accounted for, the Duke University researchers say the report may have been an over-interpretation of short-term temperature trends . The research, uses observed data, rather than the more commonly used climate models, to estimate decade-to-decade variability. 'At any given time, we could start warming at a faster rate if greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere increase without any offsetting changes in aerosol concentrations or natural variability,' said Wenhong Li, assistant professor of climate at Duke, who conducted the study with Brown. Infectious diseases, such as Ebola and West Nile virus, will rapidly spread to new areas as a result of global warming. This is according to zoologist, Professor Daniel Brooks, who warns humans can expect to face new illnesses as climate change brings crops, livestock, and humans into contact with pathogens. Professor Brooks says it will be 'the death of a thousand cuts' with society unable to keep up with the speed of disease as it spreads around the world. 'It's not that there's going to be one ""Andromeda Strain"" that will wipe everybody out on the planet,' Professor Brooks said, referring to the 1971 science fiction film about a deadly pathogen. 'There are going to be a lot of localised outbreaks that put a lot of pressure on our medical and veterinary health systems.' In his research, Professor Brooks has focused primarily on parasites in the tropics, while his colleague, Professor Eric Hoberg, has worked in Arctic regions. Each has observed the arrival of species that hadn't previously lived in that area and the departure of others, said Professor Brooks, who is affiliated with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The team examined whether climate models, such as those used by the IPCC, accurately account for natural chaotic variability that can occur in the rate of global warming. To test these, created a new statistical model based on reconstructed empirical records of surface temperatures over the last 1,000 years. 'By comparing our model against theirs, we found that climate models largely get the 'big picture' right but seem to underestimate the magnitude of natural decade-to-decade climate wiggles,' Brown said. 'Our model shows these wiggles can be big enough that they could have accounted for a reasonable portion of the accelerated warming we experienced from 1975 to 2000, as well as the reduced rate in warming that occurred from 2002 to 2013.' 'Statistically, it's pretty unlikely that an 11-year hiatus in warming, like the one we saw at the start of this century, would occur if the underlying human-caused warming was progressing at a rate as fast as the most severe IPCC projections,' Brown said. 'Hiatus periods of 11 years or longer are more likely to occur under a middle-of-the-road scenario.' Under the IPCC's middle-of-the-road scenario, there was a 70 per cent likelihood that at least one hiatus lasting 11 years or longer would occur between 1993 and 2050, Brown said. 'That matches up well with what we're seeing.' There's no guarantee, however, that this rate of warming will remain steady in coming years, Li stressed. 'Our analysis clearly shows that we shouldn't expect the observed rates of warming to be constant. They can and do change.' The IPCC has previously warmed that global warming is impacting 'all continents and across the oceans'. This map details some of the predicted affects of climate change in different continents. However the latest study claims that the worst-case scenario is unlikely to take place .","Duke University study looked at 1,000 years of temperature records .

"Three men have today been arrested on suspicion of murdering missing chef Claudia Lawrence . Three men arrested on suspicion of the murder of missing chef Claudia Lawrence have been released on bail. The three men, who are in their 50s are all from the York area. The trio were questioned over night by police investigating the chef's disappearance. Ms Lawrence was 35 when she vanished on March 18, 2009. Her father, Peter, reported her missing after she failed to turn up to work in the canteen of the University of York for her 6am shift. Detectives previously questioned a man in his 50s from York in March in connection with Ms Lawrence's murder. He remains on police bail. A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'Although they have been released from custody, proceedings in this case - as they relate to them - remain active.' Officers confirmed that Ms Lawrence's parents have been kept informed of current developments. Detectives are currently looking for evidence which could lead to the discovery of Ms Lawrence's body. Specialist teams of forensic officers have searched three locations in the York area looking for evidence. Detectives began reviewing the case in 2013 and have since carried out a number of searches, including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence's home, in the Heworth area of York, and a fingertip search of an alleyway that leads to the rear of the house. They have also issued previously unseen CCTV footage of two people walking near the house. The new arrests, and the arrest in March, are understood to be linked to these lines of inquiry. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, head of North Yorkshire Police's Major Crime Unit and the senior investigating officer in the Claudia Lawrence inquiry, said: 'I urge everyone to again show restraint and patience while we carry out these very important enquiries. Your co-operation and support is greatly appreciated by the investigation team.' Miss Lawrence (right) was reported missing by her father Peter (left) on March 18, 2009 . Specialist forensic officers searched the houses of the three suspects and their gardens . Officers completed their searches earlier this afternoon before the three men were released on police bail . There has been a £10,000 reward for information which will lead to the whereabouts of Miss Lawrence . Neighbours said the police arrived at 7am on Wednesday before cordoning off each of the houses . People living around the homes that are being searched said officers arrived just before 7am yesterday. At the address nearest to Miss Lawrence home, uniformed police wearing face masks could be seen carrying out brown evidence bags. Martin Dales, friend of Claudia's father, said the new arrests were a positive movement in the investigation but that progress was a series of ups and downs for the family. Speaking outside the chef's house, he said: 'Peter finds it very hard, going up and down. 'You feel like you might be getting somewhere and then you get let down. 'Three arrests is certainly a big movement for the police though. 'That's four people in the space of one month. Claudia Lawrence, pictured aged 27 in 2001, as a bridesmaid at her aunt's wedding in North Yorkshire . Officers stood guard while the searches continued and potential evidence was recovered from the houses . 'The public has been tremendous in keeping information coming which has helped the police.' Mr Dales added: 'Someone is withholding the truth and that is despicable. 'Imagine if it was your daughter and you were sitting around waiting for answers and somebody, for their own skin, was trying to be obstructive. 'I hope the full force of the law comes down on them.' A resident living near one of the houses said police arrived at around 7am yesterday. Tommy Ward, 81, said: 'It started off with one police car then a few more came. 'It was just around about 7am when everything started up. 'I was outside my house watching the world go by at the time. 'I haven't seen anyone arrested but a few weeks ago some sniffer dogs were there in the same house. We've had dogs a few times now. I don't know the person who lives there.'

"A pilot has blamed one of his passengers for coughing 'incessantly' into his headset during a short flight in the Northern Territory which caused him to forget to put the landing gear down, an air crash report has found. The Australian Air Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) released its report on Wednesday into the 'wheels up landing' on December 12, 2014 at Jabiru Airport, southeast of Darwin. The unidentified pilot was flying a six-seat Cessna 310 aircraft, registered VH-TBE, with two adults and three children on board when he became distracted by one of the passengers. The pilot also reported that the children on board were 'excited and a little disruptive' during the flight. Despite this, the report also found the pilot was 'relatively new to the C-310' and unfamiliar with the plane equipment. A pilot has blamed one of his passengers for coughing 'incessantly' into his headset during a short flight in the Northern Territory which caused him to forget to put the landing gear down, an air crash report has found . The unidentified pilot was flying a six-seat Cessna 310 aircraft, registered VH-TBE, with two adults and three children on board when he became distracted by one of the passengers . 'The pilot of a Cessna 310 aircraft  was completing a charter flight from Oenpelli to Jabiru, Northern Territory,' the ATSB report read. 'During the short flight, one of the passengers coughed incessantly through the headset which distracted the pilot. Once he had the aircraft stable he reached over and unplugged the headset.' The pilot was further told the ATSB that the three children on board were 'excited and a little disruptive, and he had kept a close watch on their activities'. He then reported to have commenced his pre-landing checks and verbalised 'undercarriage down', but made a decision to 'leave this particular action until later on final approach'. The Australian Air Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) released its report on Wednesday into the 'wheels up landing' on December 12, 2014 at Jabiru Airport, southeast of Darwin . When he became aware of that the undercarriage remained retracted when the aircraft touched down, he landed the plane on the runway centreline and heard the propellers contacting the ground. He then steered the aircraft slightly to the left of the runway as he was mindful of another aircraft in the circuit behind him. 'This incident highlights the impact a combination of distractions can have on aircraft operations,' the ATSB report concluded.

'In hindsight, he felt it would have been beneficial to have been familiarised with all the annunciators on TBE prior to flying the aircraft,' the report read. There were no injuries to either the pilot or passengers but the aircraft was 'substantially damaged'. A spokesman for the ATSB was unable to reveal the name of the pilot and the company involved.

"Experts said the rise in the number of reported rapes and sexual offences was due in part to high profile historic cases like Jimmy Savile's . A surge in the number of sex attacks reported to police has fuelled the first rise in recorded crime for more than a decade. Nearly 3.8million crimes were recorded by police last year, an increase of 2 per cent from 2013, figures released yesterday revealed. And a record number of rapes and other sex crimes were logged – up by a third (32 per cent) to 80,200, or 220 a day. But experts say the rise – the first since 2003-04 – was partly because victims were 'more willing' to report sex crimes, including historical ones, and police were more likely to take complaints seriously, in the wake of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. Fay Maxted, chief executive of the Survivors Trust, which represents more than 130 rape and sexual violence charities, said: 'Under-reporting is a real problem in sexual offence cases. 'One of the effects of Operation Yewtree, in the wake of Savile, has been it has brought sexual cases to the fore. The convictions of Rolf Harris and Stuart Hall have encouraged people to feel justified in coming forward.' The Office for National Statistics, which published the data, said the rise was also due to police recording complaints more accurately after accusations of 'fiddling' figures to meet targets. A police watchdog recently found a fifth of crimes were not being logged properly. The latest ONS figures showed that the number of murders and manslaughter cases in England and Wales has fallen to its lowest level for 38 years. Police recorded 515 homicides last year, 37 fewer than in 2013. But the number of rapes recorded was the highest ever at 26,703, which is an average of 73 attacks every day. Rapes at knifepoint were up by 31 per cent to 311 attacks and there were 53,559 other sexual offences recorded. Violent offences also jumped by 21 per cent to nearly 741,000. The ONS report said of the overall rise in recorded crime: 'This is the first increase since 2003-04 but needs to be seen in the context of the renewed focus on the quality of crime recording.' The high-profile convictions of Rolf Harris (left) and Stuart Hall (right) have made victims feel more confident about coming forward, said campaigners . The number of crimes logged by police is still 20 per cent lower than in 2008-09 – under the last Labour government. The picture was complicated by figures from the Crime Survey of England and Wales, which found a 7 per cent fall in overall crime to 6.9million incidents, the lowest level since 1981. The survey, which looks at people's experiences of crimes, includes incidents not reported to police. But some crimes, such as bank and credit card frauds, are left out, distorting the true rate of offending. Home Secretary Theresa May said the data showed 'police reform is working' and that crime 'has never been lower, meaning families are safer'. But her Labour shadow, Yvette Cooper, claimed that the ONS figures 'expose the shocking complacency of David Cameron and Theresa May over crime and policing'.","Nearly 3.8million crimes were recorded by the police last year .

"A woman who is five months pregnant and was fired from her job at Popeyes after an armed robber made off with $400 on her shift says she has been offered her job. Only Marissa Holcomb isn't so sure she wants to go back to the fried chicken chain in Channelview, Texas. The mother-of-three was held at gunpoint on March 31, however she was fired when she refused to pay back the money that was stolen, with the store saying she should not have allowed so much cash to be in the till at one time.

Holcomb wasn't able to access the safes, so the robber made with the cash in the till - totaling $400. Her bosses said it was against there policy to have such an amount in the register and gave Holcomb an ultimatum - pay it back or lose her job. 'I just had a gun to me. I'm not paying the money,' Holcomb told KHOU earlier in the week. 'I don't think it's right because now I'm struggling for my family because what I had to do to keep my life.

"As many as 1.5 million innocent people died at Auschwitz in horrifying conditions: its name a reminder of the atrocities of the Holocaust. But authorities say that the former concentration camp, now the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, in Oświęcim, Poland, is becoming a popular tourist destination - so popular in fact, that they may have to start turning people away. The memorial site today urged potential visitors to book their visits online ahead of time to prevent that from happening. Scroll down for video .

It said there have been more than 250,000 visitors so far this year, a rise of more than 40 per cent compared with the same period last year, which itself hit a record with 1.5 million visitors. 'Going through the Auschwitz-Birkenau space is not an easy experience for anyone,' said Dr. Piotr M.A. Cywiński, Director of the Museum. 'This authentic place has become the symbol of evil for the entire world, which is manifested by an over threefold increase in attendance, interest of the media, internet statistics as well as over half a billion people throughout the planet who watched the 70th anniversary of the liberation of KL Auschwitz live on television.'

Just 30 people are allowed to visit Auschwitz I - the original camp at any one time - for safety reasons, as well to conserve the buildings and create the best conditions for learning about its history.

"She may have all the help that money can buy - but for The Duchess of Cambridge, the prospect of having two children under the age of two will still be a huge challenge. Kate, 33, is due to give birth to her second child in the coming days - providing a little brother or sister to Prince George. William's wife already has a nanny at her disposal as well as her mother Carole, who is moving into the Cambridges' Norfolk home Anmer Hall after the new baby arrives. Scroll down for video . Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge holds Prince George poses for photographers outside St. Mary's Hospital in London shortly after giving birth in 2013. She is currently preparing to give birth to her second child . So just how difficult is it to care for a newborn with a toddler running around? Very, as it turns out. Parenting blogger Emily-Jane Clark, who runs the popular site How To Survive A Sleep Thief, which she describes as 'an antithesis to baby advice', has compiled a list of the ways that a mother can cope with caring for two kids under two. They including avoiding a double buggy, buying several blue bowls and never setting a specific time for meeting people. Read on to catch some of Emily's top tips... Having two children is significantly harder than having one, according to the experts (picture posed by models) 1. Do not bother trying to get anything done ever. While it is tricky to get stuff done with one baby, with two it is practically impossible. I have lost entire days trying to get things done and achieved nothing. You think, 'I know; I’ll write a list, get organised, tick things off as I go along.' Easy, right? Wrong. Five days later you realise you haven’t even managed to finish writing the bloody list. So I suggest doing what you can when you can. Better still just use this list: . Get up. Look after the children. Anything achieved alongside this list is automatically a bonus. 2. Don’t buy a double buggy. You will use it once, realise it is really heavy and annoying and sell it on Ebay. 3. Do not try to get anywhere on time. With two babies on the go, everything takes ages. ‘Popping out’ becomes a distant memory. I remember a time when nipping out for milk simply meant taking clothes out of the wardrobe, putting them on, grabbing my bag and leaving the house. Now it can take hours as I desperately attempt to scrub baby snot from my clothes with baby wipes, clean bums, clean teeth, change nappies, feed baby, break up fights, chase toddler, dress toddler, dress baby, leave house, forget bag, return to house, leave house, forget baby, return to house, get baby, leave house and then when I finally get to shop, I have forgotten what the hell I went for. As a mother of two young children, it is almost impossible to get anywhere on time (picture posed by models) 4. Someone always wants something from you. A banana, a biscuit, a drink, a dummy, a poo, a wee, a wipe, dinner, lunch, breakfast, a snack, toys, clothes. Take me outside, take me home, take me to the toilet, take me to the park? Story, piggyback, Play Doh, song. Your life becomes an endless cycle of getting stuff for small people. Some days you’ll want to quit. Other days you’ll want to scream. But you still get them the stuff. Because at the end of the day, it is far easier than being asked for the stuff, over and over again, ALL DAY LONG. 5. When you are expecting your second baby you will secretly worry whether you will love him or her as much as you love your first. Surely, it must be impossible to love another human being as much as you love your firstborn? There could never be a baby as cute, or as funny, or as beautiful. Then baby two arrives and they are just as cute, just as funny and just as beautiful. And before you know it, you can’t imagine life without them. When children are young, they always want whatever toy the other is playing with (picture posed by models) 6. Get an extra pair of eyes to put in the back of your head because, at one point, your children will try to kill each other. Not intentionally, of course. But toddlers seem to be under the impression that ‘dangerous’ means fun. For example; 'It will be so funny to whack my sister over the head with a mug.' And 'I wonder what will happen if I stick this pencil right up my sister’s nose.' 7. Buy two of everything. They always want what the other one has. Toddler could pick up a dead frog and Baby would still drop whatever she was doing and decide she desperately wants that dead frog more than anything in the world. You can tell them to share until you are blue in the face. But apparently ‘share’ is toddler speak for ‘snatch’. Prince William and Kate with their son Prince George, who will soon have a younger brother or sister . 8. I would also suggest that all the children’s cups and bowls are the same colour. We have a single blue bowl that is currently making my life hell. 9. Having two children close in age can be exhausting and frustrating. It is rare that a day goes by where I haven’t silently sworn about something. But mostly, it is pretty amazing. And there is a great comfort in knowing that no matter what, they will always have each other. When they are not trying to kill each other, they are best friends…at least until they both want the blue bowl.","Kate Middleton is preparing to give birth to her second child this week .

"Ben Thurlow, who has been spared jail after drunkenly attacking a female paramedic who tried to treat him after he sustained a head injury in a fight . A jilted lover who drunkenly assaulted a female paramedic as she tried a treat a head injury that he sustained has been spared jail. Ben Thurlow attacked emergency worker Rebecca Hudson while she tended to his wound that he had picked up after being assaulted on a night out in Driffield, East Yorkshire. The 23-year-old, who was suffering from a suspected concussion, shoved Ms Hudson as he tried to get out of the stationary ambulance where he was being treated. Emergency crews even called called Thurlow's friends and family in an attempt to calm him down. Police were then called and two officers were forced to escort Thurlow in the ambulance while he was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary. But on the journey to the hospital he once again attacked Ms Hudson by knocking her over. At Beverley Magistrates Court, Thurlow of Druffield who had pleaded guilty to common assault, was given a four month sentence, suspended for 12 months. At a previous hearing, the court heard how Thurlow has been drinking heavily in pubs in Driffield town centre after splitting up with his girlfriend. He had planned to propose to her before discovering she had been unfaithful, the court was told. Colette Dixon, prosecuting, told the court: 'When paramedics arrived it was 50 minutes before they had some sort of control over the defendant.' She added that he has caused 'suffering and obvious pain' to Ms Hudson. In a victim statement read out to the court, the paramedic said: 'NHS staff should be able to provide care in a safe environment, free from violence and physical assault. Since the incident, I have been off work sick for weeks. I returned to light duties, but found these too painful and went off sick again. 'I have always been very active with my children, so it has affected my family life an I have found these things difficult.' Rachael Davis, mitigating, said that Thurlow had written a letter of apology to Ms Hudson, expressing remorse at his actions. She said: 'This lady did receive a number of injuries. That is absolutely clear. 'The defendant at the time was in a state of emotional stress as well as being the victim of a very nasty assault and had a nasty head injury as a result. Thurlow had been drinking in pubs in Driffield town centre, pictured, when he was attacked and need treatment for a head injury . 'He was suffering from concussion and didn’t know what was going on. It is completely clear he was not in control of his actions. 'When the evidence was put to him he fully accepted what he has done. 'There was a lack of pre-meditation with this case and a demonstration of remorse that goes above and beyond the normal course. 'He has found himself in a situation that he never wants to find himself in again. 'Because of the state he was in he wasn’t able to accept the help of his family and friends.' But sentencing Thurlow, Anne Farnsworth, chair of the bench, said: 'We have considered the case and found you assaulted a paramedic over a long period of time due to drink. 'You have caused her to miss a great deal of work as a result. 'We accept you are very remorseful however we are very much of the view this incident meets the threshold of a custodial sentence.' Paramedics were forced to call police, who had to escort Thurlow in the ambulance which took him to Hull Royal Infirmary, pictured . He was also ordered to pay £1,750 in compensation as well as pay £85 in court costs and an £80 victim surcharge. A spokesperson for Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust said: 'Ambulance service staff do a difficult job, often in challenging circumstances. 'Physical and verbal attacks on any member of NHS staff are completely unacceptable and we are doing everything we can to prevent them. 'The safety of staff is of paramount importance to Yorkshire Ambulance Service and we operate a zero tolerance policy; action will be taken against those who are violent or aggressive towards our staff. 'Staff are never knowingly sent into dangerous or violent situations, and operate with close support from the police. Every precaution is taken to protect the safety of staff - this includes conflict resolution training.'","Ben Thurlow attacked paramedic Rebecca Hudson while in an ambulance .

"A dominatrix who claims she shared a 'hot, deep kiss' with Prince Harry during his infamous party night in Vegas three years ago says she felt 'overdressed' when she saw him playing strip billiards. Carrie Reichert, 43, who has previously said she kissed the Prince and has a pair of his underpants she hopes to use in a strip-tease show, has now written a book about the night. In an excerpt from the upcoming In the Eye of the Royal Story, she says she couldn't help but notice how 'adorably cute his naked a** was', The Sun reported. Carrie Reichert (left), 43, has released a teaser from her upcoming book In the Eye of the Royal Story in which she recounts the events of Prince Harry's infamous party night . Prince Harry, pictured above in Las Vegas in 2012, was said to have invited 10 women to party with him at his VIP suite at the Encore at Wynn hotel, including Miss Reichert . She wrote: 'I'm only in my bathing suit and feeling overdressed, wondering if I too should strip down and join him in his royal buff.' Ms Reichert went on to claim that alcohol gave her the confidence to approach the Prince before they shared a kiss. She said: 'This surreal moment felt more like a dream: I'm kissing a Prince! Tasting his lips and feeling his tongue, encouraging what is now a hot, deep kiss, both of us excited, anticipating what is yet to come.' In January, England-born Ms Reichert said she planned to use a pair of the Prince's underpants for a strip tease act. She remains the only woman to have ever spoken out about the prince's wild night in Vegas, following which pictures of him were leaked showing him playing naked billiards. Ms Reichert claims she was one of 10 women picked to party with him in the penthouse suite of the Wynn Hotel in August 2012. However, Kensington Palace has previously denied she was one of the women invited back to the Prince's VIP suite and dismissed her story as 'untrue'. Kensington Palace this evening declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline. Just weeks after the 2012 party, Miss Reichert spent a month in Harrison County Jail in Mississippi after being arrested for cheque fraud. And not long after she rose to prominence for her outrageous claims, it was revealed she was a dominatrix who charges $1,000 an hour for BDSM sessions.

"Gareth Blanks was attacked as he walked back from the shops near his home in Truro, Cornwall, because he has autism and looks vulnerable . A community is rallying around a defenceless man who was viciously beaten in a sustained and sickening attack by a gang of thugs - because he's autistic. More than 1,500 people have come out in support of Gareth Blanks after the attack that saw him kicked and punched more than 20 times. Mr Blanks, 31, was walking home after buying a chocolate bar when he was approached by a group of three men and one woman at around 8.30pm on April 17. He was taunted by the group before snatching the hat from his head. When he tried to retrieve the garment,  he was pushed to the ground, and one of the males punched and kicked him 20 times in the head and across his body. Mr Blanks is now recovering at his home in Truro, Cornwall, but his family say it will take him a long time to recover, and he has been left with deep mental scars. An online support group called Support Gareth, which has already attracted over 1,500 likes on Facebook with several leaving messages of support. His mother, Sandra, 54, who works as a dinner lady  said: 'He's still very distraught, he's shook up and it's going to take him some time before he can go out on his own again. 'They clearly targeted because of his condition. He does look vulnerable and walks around in his own little world. They didn't take anything about from his hat so their intention was clearly just to take the mickey out of him. 'When he came in, he was crying and really upset. 'As a mum, it was horrific to see. I am now just spending all my time trying to get my son sorted out. 'All the support he has got has been a tremendous help and we are so grateful. 'But this will take him a long time to get over. The physical scars will heal a lot quicker than the mental ones.' Mrs Blanks, who has five children Kelly, 33, Samantha, 27, Lyndsey, 29, and Roy, 34, added: 'I really think need the people responsible need help themselves. There is a lot I would like to say about them - but I can't. 'I don't think they would have liked to have got the beating they gave to my son.'

Investigation office PC Kim James, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said: 'It was a vicious and unprovoked attack by a female and three males in their late teens or early 20s.' Sergeant Marc Sayers, from Truro police, said: 'This is clearly a cowardly attack on a vulnerably young man going about his normal business. It was almost pack activity. 'We take all attacks extremely seriously but this is exceptional, it was completely unwarranted and unprovoked.

"Everybody knows that New York is called ‘The Big Apple’, that London is known as ‘The Old Smoke’ and that Paris is referred to as ‘The City of Love’ – but do you know why? Some nicknames refer to the ancient heritage of the city, some refer to the industry found in the city, some refer to the cities’ environment – there are a variety of reasons these cities have earned their unique monikers. Flights company Just The Flight have researched city nicknames all over the world, finding out the real stories behind each and every one of them to produce a handy infographic. Taking a wild guess at why Las Vegas is often referred to as ‘Sin City’, for example, might seem incredibly obvious - but the nickname actually came about before the Las Vegas was even built. In fact, it stemmed from a street known as Block 16 that became famous in the early 1900s for selling alcohol and for offering prostitution. Harry Peters, from Just The Flight, told MailOnline Travel: 'Block 16 and the surrounding area was demolished after the Second World War, and Las Vegas as we know it today was built up around it – but the ‘Sin City’ nickname has stuck, and is still rather relevant today.' Singapore, or ‘Lion City’, is another interesting one. ‘Singapura’ literally translates to ‘Lion City’ but the reason for the name came about as the founder, Sir Stamford Raffles, supposedly saw a merlion – a mix between a mermaid and a lion – despite lions not even being native to the city at all. Some nicknames come from terms journalists have used to describe the city and some, such as Dallas being known as ‘Big D’, don’t quite have the same history to them. Las Vegas is known as Sin City now for it's gambling and temptation - but the nickname dates back to a building used by prostitutes . The history of Philadelphia is recognised by its nickname of 'The City Of Brotherly Love'. English Quaker William Penn founded the city in 1682 and wanted it to be a place of harmony and substance. Amsterdam in the Netherlands is known for its great number of canals, and so even if you didn't know, you could understand why it is known as 'The Venice Of The North.' Venice, however isn't known as 'The Amsterdam Of The South'. The northeastern city has the tag 'The Bride Of The Sea,' that relates to a ceremony where the doge (leader) throws a ring into the sea so that Venice is 'married.' And Paris might be known as 'The City Of Love' for its romantic architecture and stunning landmarks, but it is tagged 'The City Of Light' after it became the first in Europe to use electric street lamps.","Las Vegas' nickname of Sin City relates to a building prostitutes used .

"Barclays chairman Sir David Walker defended the bank’s decision to pay out £1.86billion in bonuses . Furious Barclays shareholders vented frustration at the generous pay packages handed to hundreds of its top traders yesterday – with one investor asking: ‘What has their “talent” ever done for us?’ The scandal-hit lender faced a barrage of criticism from long-suffering investors, many of them pensioners, at its annual general meeting in London. Shareholders are reeling from big losses in their investments and pension funds as Barclays’ share price has plunged since the financial crisis. Last year its profits dropped again by 21 per cent to £2.3billion after it was hit by huge bills for wrongdoing. But yesterday chairman Sir David Walker defended the bank’s decision to pay out £1.86billion in bonuses, including packages of more than £1million to 359 employees. Group chief executive Antony Jenkins saw his pay package more than triple to £5.5million, after opting to accept a £1.1million bonus. Facing criticism over the pay package, Sir David claimed the bank needed to pay ‘competitively’ to attract the best talent. But the argument received short shrift from investors who have seen Barclays fork out billions for various scandals while the share price has fallen from £7 to just under £2.60. During the height of the financial crisis in 2009 they fell to 47p, leaving many savers who sold their shares with huge losses. Shareholder Phil Clarke said: ‘Employees should share the wealth created by great companies. My problem is what happens when there is no success – and there is limited success in this company.’ Referring to Monty Python’s ‘what have the Romans ever done for us’ sketch, Mr Clarke said: ‘I’d like to paraphrase Monty Python and ask what has all this “talent” done for us? ‘The answer is this talent has made losses for shareholders, destroyed value and dragged our reputation through the mud to the extent that banker has become a dirty word. Yet these people have enjoyed massive salaries and we’ve paid for it.’ At the meeting, Barclays’ bosses referred repeatedly to the moral values of the bank’s Quaker founders, with chairman Sir David describing how they ‘relied on their own hard work, pioneering spirit and moral code to become trusted figures in their communities’.

Rogue traders in London orchestrated a worldwide conspiracy to rig interest rates, landing Germany’s biggest bank with a record £1.7billion fine. Several banks have already been penalised after traders were caught manipulating Libor interest rates, which are used to set the cost of mortgages and are linked to trillions of dollars of investments around the world. So far total fines against banks including Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland have hit £5.6billion. But the latest settlement dwarfs the £1billion levied against UBS in 2012, which was previously the biggest fine issued for rigging Libor rates. At least 29 employees were involved in the wrongdoing, which lasted between January 2005 and December 2010. Most of the rogue staff were based in London, but they also worked in Frankfurt, Toyko and New York – showing the global nature of the conspiracy. So far just 12 of the people involved in rate-rigging have been sacked, but US regulators have now ordered Deutsche Bank to fire another seven staff, including six senior employees in London. Richard Lloyd, executive director at consumer group Which?, said: ‘Rigged markets will ultimately hit people in the pocket, so the regulator must continue to take tough action.’ Jurgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain, co-chief executive officers of Deutsche Bank, said: ‘The Bank accepts the findings of the regulators. We deeply regret this matter but are pleased to have resolved it.’ But the comments incensed one pensioner – who pointed to the ‘criminal’ behaviour of Barclays in the 21st century. Barclays is currently waiting for a huge fine for manipulating the £3trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, and has set aside almost £1.3billion so far for the scandal. Last year it was also forced to set aside £1.1billion for mis-selling payment protection insurance, taking its total bill so far to £5.2billion. Michael Mason–Mahon said: ‘The men who started it were honourable. But you seem to have lost your way.’ He added: ‘Our society cannot longer cope with bankers that are hell-bent on criminal acts, leaving shareholders to pick up the tab.’","Barclays shareholders angered by generous pay packages for top traders .

"Two best friends who shed an impressive amount of weight and scored top modelling careers prove that with a little determination and self-belief, you can achieve your dreams. Jamie Jewitt, 24, and Henry Rogers, 22, both admit that when they were in their teens, their self-esteem was at rock bottom. Henry, from Ealing, reached eighteen stone at his heaviest. Before he made his foray into modelling, Henry, 22, was a student and working part-time as an electronic salesman. Scroll down for video . Henry Rogers, 22, hit 18st at his heaviest, left, but went on an intense two-year diet, including going vegan for a year, and now he's a sought-after model, right . At this point, he was keen to pursue a career in rugby, which was his passion. However, after reaching 18st, he decided to embark on a strict diet and after shedding the pounds and slimming down to 12st, he landed a job at Abercrombie & Fitch, where he was scouted by top agency, Models 1. His best friend Jamie Jewitt, 24, from Essex, weighed 15st before his 15th birthday. Jamie was so self-conscious with his looks, he barely posed for any photographs and has hardly any snaps from his teen years. Before he made his foray into modelling, left, Henry was a student and working part-time as an electronic salesman. After shedding the weight, he landed a job in Abercrombie & Fitch and his career sky-rocketed from there, right . The men are using their new-found platform to speak out in a bid to break the 'shame' around body image and insecurity amongst men . After two years of intense and solid training - which included following a strict vegan diet for a year - he shed the excess weight and now weighs 12st. After he shed the weight, his family urged him to go to a casting following years of taunts about the way he looked. The first casting was unsuccessful and he focused on his education. But fearing that he'd feel defeated, his parents encouraged him to go to a second casting. He was successful and moved out to New York alone to pursue his career in modelling. Despite initial setbacks, the pair  have since fronted campaigns for Tom Ford, Armani, Prada and Dolce & Gabbana. Jamie Jewitt, 24, from Essex, pictured left, at school, weighed 15st before his 15th birthday and was so self-conscious he would hardly ever pose for photos. After two years of intense and solid training - which included following a vegan diet for a year - he shed the excess weight and now weighs 12st, right . The duo have even ventured into the world of reality TV, starring on New York's answer to Made In Chelsea, Taking New York. The boys have, however, left the show to focus on their modelling careers. And now, they say they want to use their new-found platform to speak out in a bid to break the ’shame’ around ‘body image’ and ‘insecurity’ amongst men. So why do some men struggle to talk about body insecurities? Jamie and Henry think it is a 'masculine thing'. Discussing the topic, Jamie said: 'This year we have seen women leading the way. The likes of the Spice Girls encouraged the ""feel good"" movement. They encouraged women coming together and celebrating ""body beautiful"". 'But, for men, we are all too cowardly to talk about body image and insecurities. Even though we are all feeling it, we are not having those discussions down the gym. You don’t want to be that guy that gets a tough time from your mates for talking out. It is silly really.' After he shed the weight, Jamie's family urged him to go to a casting following years of taunts about the way he looked - and he managed to get spotted and now stars in the biggest designer's campaigns . The pair want to use their newfound platform for the better and are getting set to promote healthy male body image in a photoshoot with Attitude/Ateen coming out in June . Henry added: 'For some reason men don’t feel like they can admit that they are insecure about their looks, that they don’t feel the same pressures that women do. But with all the women paving the way for us and speaking out so confidently about their insecurities, we thought, why not admit to the world that we’re not always comfortable in our skin either. 'Where are the male celebrity ambassadors talking out about body image? There aren’t any. Where are the female celebrity ambassadors talking out about body image? Everywhere. 'From Pink to Kelly Clarkson. Women are out there talking loud and proud. We are letting the side down.'

"Tesco is under pressure to axe 200 stores — on top of 100 already closed or cancelled — after the supermarket giant announced a record annual loss of £6.38billion. The loss is the largest ever declared by a British retailer and reflects a seismic shift in shopping habits away from big supermarkets towards smaller budget stores. Over the past 20 years, Tesco went on a spending spree to build up a vast land bank that was designed to expand its empire of some 3,000 stores. Scroll down for video . Shock: Supermarket giant Tesco announced a record annual loss of £6.38billion yesterday . However, families no longer want to do a big, weekly shop in a soul-less hypermarket. As a result, Tesco has been forced to slash the value of its property empire and sell off land cheaply, with the loss of thousands of jobs. Britain’s biggest retailer made a profit of £1.4billion on sales through the tills across the world in the year to the end of February, down by 60 per cent on the year before. This profit was more than wiped out by £7billion worth of one-off costs, led by a write-down of £4.3billion on the value of its land and stores. There was also a write-down of some £570 million on the food and other products sitting in its warehouses and stores, while the company has agreed to pump an extra £270million a year into its staff pension scheme, which has a deficit of £3.9billion. The closure of more than 45 stores and its current head office in Hertfordshire will cost more than £400million. The firm is also cutting back on future expansion, with the cancellation of more than 50 ‘big box’ stores. The loss of £6.38 billion — the biggest in the supermarket’s 96-year history — was even worse than the most pessimistic City analysts had expected. Shares in Tesco closed down 5.2 per cent on the day, wiping around £1billion off its stock market value and taking it down to just over £18billion. Here, retail industry veterans, plus Mail writers, identify what on earth went wrong . . . THE EXPERTS . Mary Portas, retail consultant . The problem with Tesco is that no one really likes the company. Consumers either want pure value, or want to be looked after and put first as customers. Tesco didn’t do either. Today, people want brands they trust, and the truth is Tesco acted in a bullish way – they built where they wanted, when they wanted, they didn’t care about the effect on communities . . . and now people are turning their backs on them. Image problem: Mary Portas says the problem with Tesco 'is that no one really likes the company' Sir Richard Greenbury, former chief executive of Marks & Spencer . When I ran Marks & Spencer we looked at having a private jet for the board. I deemed it too expensive, even when we were making a billion pounds a year. Tesco having four private jets tells you something about the culture of the place. It has also tried to do far too much. It tried conquering the Far East, then China. But to try to go into America at the same time was a very, very bad idea. You cannot conquer the world overnight. Joanna Blythman, author of Shopped: The Shocking Power Of British Supermarkets . I’m no fan of supermarkets in general, but Tesco is at the absolute bottom of my list. Once upon a time, when we believed Tesco was good value and trusted the brand, we tolerated — up to a point — how five or six stores bullied their way into our communities. But the arrival of Aldi and Lidl made us realise that the ‘Big Four’ supermarkets have been charging us way too much — earning extreme margins and profiteering at our expense. 'Too much': Former M&S chief executive Sir Richard Greenbury blames Tesco's grand expansion plans . Lord Haskins, former chairman of Northern Foods . Tesco’s problem is that it tried to be all things to all men. It has vast stores that want to be an M&S and a Lidl all in one. Asda concentrates on the cheap-and-cheerful market, while Waitrose still targets the top end of the market, and both are successful for keeping it more simple. Bill Grimsey, former boss of Wickes, Iceland and Focus . Tesco must be clear on pricing — it needs to stop the offers and promotions. If Poundland charges £1 for a cleaner, so should Tesco. People want great value but consistency, too. Tesco also needs to rationalise the options of products — its stores have way too many product lines and categories. Tom Salmon, ran the now defunct Hedon Salads which supplied Tesco . Tesco’s problem was that it kept screwing over its suppliers. It demanded a wave of charges for things like new label systems or the introduction of new technology. These charges to suppliers became more and more unreasonable, and in the end the company ruined its base. MAIL WRITERS . Sarah Vine . I’ve always defended Tesco to my middle-class friends. Remember, I’d say, not everyone can afford to buy their groceries at Waitrose. But even I, a stubborn Tesco shopper, have fallen out of love with the store over the past couple of years. Besides its self-pay tills seemingly never working and its Finest range not being as fine as it used to be, its online delivery service is rubbish. Over the years, I’ve flirted with all the supermarket delivery services, but, in the end, I settled for Tesco because it always had the best offers on quality dishwasher tablets — and lots of convenient evening delivery slots. However, last year I switched to Sainsbury’s. There were four reasons I abandoned Tesco: rude delivery drivers who were often late; a slew of items substituted for ones I’d ordered; too many annoying flash sales (although Ocado is guilty of this, too); and one rotten tomato too many. Abandoned: Sarah Vine (left) said one rotten tomato too many made her turn her back on Tesco after years as a loyal customer, while Libby Purves (right) said a trip to Tesco became a 'sweaty, irritating chore' Libby Purves . For me, it was the sense of contempt. We had a local Tesco we used, in the absence of any good, big supermarkets in a rural area, and it was OK. Nothing special, but handy for things the smaller shops might not stock and for bulk buys. But a few years ago it increased the ‘homewares’ section and the children’s clothes, in roughly the same overall space. The aisles got narrower, the layout was confusing and the staff on the floor were fewer and surlier. It became a sweaty, irritating chore to shop there. So we stopped. Meanwhile, the Co-op improved and then came a Waitrose, all smiley and willing and smart and not more expensive for basics. End of! Alex Brummer, City Editor . At the heart of the problems for Tesco’s new boss, Dave Lewis, has been some wildly over-optimistic accounting. Under his predecessor, Phil Clarke, the books essentially were cooked to make profits look stronger and debts look less than was truthfully the case. The Serious Fraud Office is investigating. Over the past year or so, Britain’s biggest grocer inflated its profits in the UK and Ireland by as much as £326 million, by recording incentive payments from big suppliers that had not actually arrived, while failing to record the costs of some sales. In the City, the arrival of a new boss often signals a ‘kitchen sink job’ under which all the bad announcements are made to the stock exchange in one go to signal the start of a better era. In this case, it has resulted in a £6.4 billion loss. Disloyal: Jan Moir says it is the lack of brand loyalty which really harmed Tesco . Sandra Parsons . Tesco’s problem is that it’s forgotten who its customers are. Its founder Jack Cohen’s philosophy was simple: ‘Pile ’em high, sell ’em cheap.’ You didn’t go to Tesco because you liked the service or aspired to throwing a classier dinner party. You went because it was the best value for money. Today that’s no longer the case. Not only are Sainsbury’s meat and its Taste The Difference range better quality than the Tesco equivalents, but they’re cheaper, too. As an experiment yesterday, I did a basic shop of veg, fruit, bacon, chicken, detergent, cat food, bread, fizzy water and a bottle of Prosecco at both supermarkets. Sainsbury’s came out £2 cheaper — and you’d save even more if you went to Morrisons, Asda, Aldi or Lidl. Jan Moir . Tesco thought that ubiquity was everything. There was never enough staff in their thousands of stores, yet they kept opening more, sometimes even in competition with each other. However, I believe Tesco’s fatal mistake was believing that consumers loved it for what it was. In fact, its core customers were interested only in the price. When the same or similar goods were cheaper elsewhere, they left in droves. There was no brand loyalty, especially when everyone else started doing online delivery, too. Rose Prince . Ultimately Tesco has failed because it put quantity before quality. Its mantra was ‘be big’; it wanted to dominate and did not care enough about where it sourced food or that customers’ tastes would change, particularly in a recession. Tesco came off worst in the horse meat scandal because its staff did not ask the right questions when they bought the cheapest meat — and shoppers were repelled by the outcome. There is also a sense the stores do not excel at anything in particular. Just being ‘big’ is not a lasting philosophy.","Tesco announced a record annual loss of £6.38billion yesterday .

"Fashion-conscious militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have been dealt a blow after their commanders banned them wearing products made by Nike. The sports brand features prominently on a leaflet distributed in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa warning ISIS jihadis about items of clothing they are no longer allowed to wear. The news comes shortly after one militant decried the popularity of Nike among ISIS fighters, comparing the brand's name and famous 'tick' logo to wearing a Christian cross. His comments prompted a fierce debate with fellow jihadis who argued that it was perfectly acceptable to wear Nike products because they are 'comfy and good quality, unlike crosses'. Banned: The sports brand features prominently (circled) on a leaflet distributed in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa warning ISIS jihadis about items of clothing they are no longer allowed to wear . Not allowed: The leaflet threatens both the buyer and seller of Nike products with punishments ranging from a small fine to whipping or even imprisonmen . Images of the leaflet banning Nike clothing was shared online by the activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently who translated it from Arabic. They said Nike was singled out because of its associations with the Greek goddess of the same name and because the word apparently sounds similar to phrases of a sexual nature in Arabic. The leaflet threatens both the buyer and seller of Nike products with punishments ranging from a small fine to whipping or even imprisonment. This is despite the fact one of the group's most famous commanders, Abu Waheeb, is well known for wearing Western sportswear, including items made by Nike and Adidas. The argument that senior ISIS militants still wear Nike products is unlikely to be considered much of a defence for the millions of brutally oppressed citizens living under the rule of the Islamic State. Fashion-conscious: The ban comes despite the fact one of the group's most famous commanders, Abu Waheeb, is well known for wearing Western sportswear, including items made by Nike and Adidas . The wearing of Nike products has long been contentious among ISIS jihadis, due to the fact the name was inspired by a Greek goddess and reportedly sound like several words of a sexual nature in Arabic . The news comes shortly after one militant decried the popularity of Nike among ISIS fighters, comparing the brand's famous 'tick' logo to wearing a Christian cross. His comments prompted a fierce debate with fellow jihadis who argued that it was perfectly acceptable to wear Nike products because they are 'comfortable' A recent ban of men wearing jeans - apparently because the clothing 'provokes sexual desire, and shows the attractions of men's body' - has been strictly enforced. In fact some young men seen wearing jeans after the ban was put in place were reportedly told they must exchange their denim products for pyjamas, or face time in prison. As well as products made by Nike, numerous other items of clothing appear on the leaflet. Newly-banned products on the list include anything carrying swear words or sexual phrases. To help non-English speakers recognise the banned terms, the ISIS leaflet helpfully provides a long list of swear words alongside their Arabic translation. Nike did not respond to a request for comment on the ban.","Jihadis face fines, whipping or even jail time for wearing Nike products .

"A device has been created that can scan entire planes for contraband, bombs and weapons. The mobile X-ray scanner, heralded as the world’s first ‘airplane scanner’, sweeps down a plane and can detect various objects inside. While the radiation emitted by the scanner is not safe yet for humans to be in the plane when it is operated, the company behind it thinks it could become a vital tool in aircraft safety. Scroll down for video . Romanian company MB Telecom has revealed the Roboscan 2M Aeria. It uses a cone of radiation to sweep across planes (shown) and look inside. The device is accurate enough to find a filament in a light bulb. But the radiation it emits is not safe for passengers yet . The Roboscan 2M Aeria is being developed by Romanian company MB Telecom (MBT). It costs €3 million (£2.1 million, $3.2 million), reported The Times, and is apparently already being used to check trucks at borders in Eastern Europe, where it has helped seize 76,000 packs of illegal cigarettes. On its website, MBT says the Aeria is ‘the very first solution for aircraft security inspection.’ It can scan planes from small private jets to medium-sized commercial airplanes. The company notes that, while passengers and their luggage are thoroughly inspected at airports, there is no such inspection process for jets arriving at small private airports with low security. But with their device, the company says this ‘gap’ in aviation security can be plugged, and it can scan an entire plane in about 20 minutes. The device can be used to detect weapons (shown) and other contraband in small or medium-sized jets that land at low-security airports . An operator working inside the truck can look inside the entirety of a plane, although currently under regulations some areas of the plane - such as the fuselage and wings - are restricted . There are four main components that allow an aircraft to be scanned. Armed with a sharp sense of smell, dogs have a long history of detecting explosives for their human handlers, and soon there could be sniffer elephants too. Researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. The research was conducted in South Africa and involved the U.S. military. The first is the operating truck, from which an operator can use the system and look inside the plane. Attached to this is a robotic arm with an X-ray generator at the end. The plane is then pulled forwards by a battery-operated tug over a wide detection module. By firing X-rays out of the arm, a cone of radiation sweeps over the plane. The operator inside the truck is then given live images of the interior of the plane, and is able to scan its entirety for hidden items. It is apparently so accurate that it could pick out keys on a seat or even a filament in a light bulb. One issue, though, is that aircraft operators do not authorities to inspect the whole plane - areas of the fuselage and the wings are off limits, even though Roboscan can examine these areas. ‘You cannot touch it, but you can scan it,’ said Radu Tudor of MBT at the Counter Terror Expo in London this week.

"Four burly Swedish cops put their New York City vacation on hold to answer the call of duty on a Manhattan subway train last night. The friends were on their way to see Les Misérables on Broadway, DNA Info reports, and rushed in to stop a brutal assault on a crowded rush-hour 6 train. 'We came here for vacation. We’ve been here one day. We’re no heroes, just tourists,' Makrus Åsberg, a 25-year-old officer with the police Uppsala, Sweden, told the New York Post.

'Take it easy, just calm down,' Asberg tells him. The friends sprang into action after a frantic conductor yelled over the intercom: 'Are there any police officers on the train?' As the train pulled into the Bleeker Street station, the Nordic lawmen found a homeless man pummeling another rider in the next car. Three of the Swedes tended to the aggressor (background) and held him for police, while the fourth stayed with the victim, who had been badly beaten in the fight . The Nordic tourists kept both men calm until NYPD cops showed up to sort out the scene . The victim had a bloody mouth and seemed to be badly beaten and was not defending himself the Swedes told the Post. One of the officers put the attacker in an arm lock, while two others held him down to the floor of the train. 'One of the guys tried to wrestle us so [we] wrestled him to the floor until the police came,' Kvarzell, 25, who is also an officer, told DNA Info.

"Miriam Gonzalez Durantez today claimed right-wing Tories probably want to kick her out of the country . Nick Clegg's wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez today claimed right-wing Tories probably want to kick her out of the country. The Spanish lawyer said she had been 'religiously paying taxes' in the UK for 10 years and would like to be able to vote in the election on May 7, but took a swipe at the party her husband has spent five years in power with. It comes after Mr Clegg warned the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' which is losing all grip on the party. Despite polls showing the Lib Dems facing wipeout in large parts of the country, Mrs Clegg today insisted her husband cling on in his battle to retain Sheffield Hallam. Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain, she was asked whether she was frustrated she was not allowed to vote in May's General Election. As a Spaniard, she is allowed to vote in local and European elections but not elections for Commons seats. She said: 'It is what it is. I have been here for 10 years, I have been religiously paying taxes, and yes it would be nice to be able to vote. 'Listen, if it was up to the right-wing of the Tory party, they would probably kick me out of the country altogether so I am happy I can be here.' The Lib Dems have stepped up attacks on the Tories in recent days, warning Mr Cameron risks being in hock to right wing Tory backbenchers and Ukip after the election. In an interview with MailOnline, Mr Clegg yesterday said that it is a 'tragedy' that a centrist politician like Mr Cameron had lost control of his party. 'What's happening is you are seeing the bandwagons of the far right encircling an increasingly hapless Conservative leadership. 'And the Conservative leadership will become just victim to and puppets of an array of hardline right wing voices from Ukip, from DUP, from their own backbenches, which will do huge damage to our country. Huge damage.' Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg told MailOnline's political editor Matt Chorley that the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' Mr Clegg claimed right wing Tories want to 'enter into coalition with Ukip, some of them want to bring back the death penalty, they want to ban the burka'. 'They have got very hardline views on people who need help from the state because they have fallen on hard times,' Mr Clegg said. 'And they take this very ideological view that basically the state and support for public services should be remorselessly cut back and cut back and cut back and cut back for no reason other than some kind of hardline ideological preference for it.' Mr Clegg also revealed he is such a bad cook his wife only lets him do the washing up. The Lib Dem leader admitted his 'rubbishness' in the kitchen after it emerged his wife and sons had been secretly running a food blog - MumAndSons - posting recipes and photographs online. Mr Clegg said he had played no part in the culinary operation, but had helped with taking pictures for the blog: 'I'm sure you can see my hand in a couple of them.' Mrs Clegg revealed this week that she has been running a secret food blog for three years, forcing her hsuband to reveal his 'rubbishness' in the kitchen . But his own cooking abilities do not stretch to more than peanut butter on toast. 'I'm a sort of sous chef, Mr Clegg told MailOnline. 'I provide helpful moral backing and assistance. I'll do the washing up, and tasting and preparatory tasks.' Asked if there was nothing he could cook, Mr Clegg replied: 'I'm sure I could but I'm great eater, I'm just really not a very good cook. 'If I had to, if I was starving... Peanut butter on white toast obviously, with jam on top. I'm seriously into jam on top.' News of www.mumandsons.com emerged earlier this week when Mr Clegg's wife took part in an online chat with Mumsnet . It features recipes for a range of dishes - such as bean quesadillas, lemon curd muffins and pasta with chorizo - with contributions from Ms Gonzalez Durantez and her three sons. She said: 'It's no secret this campaign, what people are saying is it is a super-controlled campaign. 'When you have parties that are so close, pretty much everybody becomes professionals of politics, everything is measured, everything is polled. 'That is why I thought when they see something I have done out of the script they might freak out but they were very good humoured about it and obviously we, as the third party, we have less money than the others and less control, which is good.'","Lib Dem leader's wife takes swipe at party he shared power with since 2010 .

"Bulgaria might not be the first hotspot that springs to mind for a summer holiday – but that could change after it was named Europe's cheapest destination yesterday. The former Soviet state has gained the most from the strong pound, which has cut the cost of visiting the continent. Resorts on its Black Sea coast offer the best value in terms of a meal out, buying a cup of coffee and essentials such as sun cream and a cold drink, according to a study. Scroll down for video . Affordable: Bulgaria has been named Europe's cheapest destination, with Black Sea resorts like Sunny Beach (pictured) offering the best value in terms of a meal out and other holiday activities . Hotspot: Bulgaria's most popular resort of Sunny Beach is a carbon copy of those of Spain and Greece . It is one of 13 European hotspots out of 14 where your cash will go far further this summer, largely thanks to rock-bottom exchange rates and higher inflation in some countries. Research into an imaginary shopping basket of ten typical holiday purchases showed a total price of £37.39 for Bulgaria, which is down by 13.6 per cent from last summer. There was a bigger fall of 22 per cent for the Algarve in Portugal, taking the total cost to £44.02, helping it beat Spain's Costa del Sol to become the second cheapest destination. Only in Turkey, where inflation is 7.6 per cent – compared to virtually zero in Britain and the eurozone – will Britons find the cost of a day out much more expensive. The figures, compiled for the annual Post Office Holiday Costs Barometer, show the spending basket in Turkey is up by 21.4 per cent on last year, at £65.70. Bulgaria's most popular resort of Sunny Beach is a carbon copy of those of Spain and Greece. Described by travel agents as 'lively', it has a wide sandy beach, high-rise hotels, bars, restaurants and water parks. It also has a long summer season from May to September and boasts around 300 days of sunshine year – more than Miami Beach in Florida. Peak-season return flights to Burgas airport cost £400 a head. Once there, a three-course meal for two with wine comes in at £19.60, and a cup of coffee at 78p. The country, whose currency is the lev, also has some popular ski resorts. The research is good news for travellers to the Algarve, which offers good-value restaurants, with a three-course meal for two including wine costing just £16.42, while a coffee will set you back 52p. At the other end of the scale, Sorrento in southern Italy is the dearest resort. Its basket costs £101.60 – almost three times Bulgaria's. Holiday: Bulgaria (pictured) is one of 13 European hotspots out of 14 where your cash will go far further this summer, largely thanks to rock-bottom exchange rates and higher inflation in some countries . There, a cup of coffee comes in at £1.49, while the three-course meal for two was a much dearer £52.24. Andrew Brown, of Post Office Travel Money, said: 'Meal prices can have a big impact on the holiday budget and make a big dent in holiday finances for people who plan to eat out every night. 'In the Algarve, a three-course meal costs less than half the price in other resorts. Be aware of what to expect before facing the bill.'","Bulgaria's Black Sea resorts cheaper than hotspots in Italy, Spain and Turkey .

"The Shepherd’s Life: A Tale of the Lake District . by James Rebanks . (Allen Lane £16.99) When, in 2002, my family and I moved from busy North London to bucolic north Herefordshire, we found that our new neighbours were, overwhelmingly, sheep. I didn’t want to be one of those townies who moves to the country but remains ignorant of rural ways, so I made sporadic efforts to get to know them, or at least, to get to understand life on a sheep farm. When my children were small, I asked the obliging farmer whose land abuts our garden if they could watch his ewes lambing. And I still often tell him that I’d like to spend some time alongside him, to see how his days unfold. To which he always smiles, no doubt wondering, metropolitan softie that I still really am, how I’d cope with the early starts and the relentless physical graft. This wonderful book has filled in most of the gaps in my education, without any 4.30am alarm calls. James Rebanks studied at the University of Oxford before returning to his roots in the Lake District, he is seen here with his sheep on his farm outside of Penrith in Cumbria . It is the enlightening, exquisitely written account, give or take a few autobiographical tangents, of a year in the life of James Rebanks, whose family has been farming in the Lake District for at least six centuries. He was born into a job from which, now in his 40s, he takes infinite pride. All the same, it is no life for the faint-hearted. Every year, spring and autumn feel like flimsy bookends to a long, harsh winter, and his Herdwick sheep — descended, he thinks, from animals that arrived with the Vikings — are built for the fells in ways that even the hardiest shepherds are not. Making hay, linked by an old proverb to images of glorious sunny days, can be ‘a bitch of a job’. And while working with livestock is a series of small, predictable daily challenges, sometimes the challenges are bigger, and not at all predictable. With starkly effective prose, he brilliantly evokes the horror of the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak. After police snipers had arrived on his farm, ‘the fields were speckled with our dead cattle . . . Strangely peaceful, they lay in all sorts of mangled and contorted ways. I knew those cattle, so it was like seeing old friends dead’. As for the sheep, 95 per cent of the world’s Herdwicks live within 20 miles of Coniston, and were in danger of extinction. ‘But an essentially urban government didn’t understand. To them, a sheep was a sheep, a farm simply a farm. The idea that something precious was on the edge of destruction was never really grasped.’ It is a farmer’s lot, adds Rebanks, to depend on the whims of others: of bureaucrats, supermarket buyers, shoppers. Alas, most of them have no understanding of the proud, beleaguered culture he comes from, just like the secondary school teachers who told him that farming on the Lakeland fells was a dead-end business, a waste of brainpower. Anyone with even a sliver of ambition and character, they suggested, would seek a life elsewhere. And although one teacher talked rhapsodically about the Lakes, it was in terms the disdainful teenage Rebanks simply could not comprehend. ‘The Lake District in her monologue was the playground for an itinerant band of climbers, poets, walkers and daydreamers . . . people who, unlike our parents, or us, had “really done something”. Occasionally, she would utter a name such as Wordsworth, or Wainwright, ‘and look in vain for us to understand’. Rebanks loathed school, and left at 15, able to write only in block capitals. But his book does not undermine the importance of education — far from it. Toiling on the farm, he found himself at odds with his decent, hard-working but obstreperous father, and escaped by reading, which he had resisted so strongly during his schooldays. One day he pulled off a shelf A Shepherd’s Life, written in 1910 by W.H. Hudson, just knowing ‘it was going to be lousy and patronising’. It was the exact opposite. It was about families like his, and it inspired him to read more, learn more. At 21, he took his A-levels at evening classes in nearby Carlisle, where in due course they told him that he might actually be Oxbridge material. On his application form for Oxford he described himself as a ‘drystone wall builder on the Lake District fells’. Natural charm and a certain northern pugnaciousness helped him breeze through his interview, but in ‘every conversation for the next three years’ he had to suffer someone saying what a big change Oxford must represent after life on the farm. One professor ventured that he would miss his old existence, after graduating. ‘I told him that I hadn’t stopped doing it, that I was going back. He seemed quite confused by this.’ Rebanks never contemplated not going back. He applied his brain and brawn to running the farm that had belonged to his grandfather and father, and lives there today with his wife and three children. That Oxford degree is not wasted; in a fleeting, almost throwaway paragraph, he tells us that he is also an ‘expert adviser’ to the Unesco World Heritage Centre in Paris, helping them understand how tourism can benefit host communities. But then, nor is it wasted in the work he does on the farm, a job more reliant than most on skill and judgment. Breeding from the best rams, or ‘tups’, he suggests, is more intellectually challenging than much of what he did at Oxford. At sales, he adds, everyone tries to get their tup to stand correctly, broad and thick-set and with their heads up, giving an impression of arrogance, ‘like Russell Crowe in Gladiator’. I was beguiled by this book, such an eloquent love letter to a cherished way of life, and more specifically, to his grandparents and parents, to whom he was born not with a silver spoon in his mouth, but a wooden crook in his hand. Perhaps above all it is a love letter to the Lake District, which I know well from my own Lancashire childhood, but only as a place to visit, not to live in. As Rebanks makes abundantly clear — not least with his effusive praise for a famous children’s author, whom he thinks of not as the creator of Peter Rabbit, nor even as Beatrix Potter, but as Mrs Heelis, doughty champion of Herdwick sheep — there is, between the two, all the difference in the world.","This book is an exquisite account of what farming life is really like .

"Three new women have accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault, bringing his total number of alleged victims to 38. Janice Baker Kinney, Marcella Tate, and Autumn Burns held a press conference on Thursday morning in Los Angeles, California, to announce their claims. Their attorney Gloria Allred, who represents most of Cosby's accusers, said the event was timed deliberately to damage sales for the comedian's upcoming shows on his nationwide tour. Scroll down for video . Latest accusers: Janice Baker Kinney (far left), Marcella Tate, (second right) and Autumn Burns (far right) reveal they also claim to have been abused by Bill Cosby. They appeared with their attorney Gloria Allred . Bill Cosby has yet to comment on the new allegations, which have prompted him to cancel a number of upcoming stops on his comedy tour. Allred said the meeting was scheduled to damage Cosby's ticket sales . Kinney said she was 24 in May 1982 when she and a friend met Cosby at the casino where she worked in Reno, Nevada. She said the three of them went back to Cosby's apartment, where he gave her some pills. Hours later, she claims, she woke up naked in bed with the comedian - and he told her to keep their encounter to themselves. 'I was mortified at what had happened,' Kinney said. 'All this time, and for many, many years, I felt that this was my fault.' Burns said she was a 20-year-old Las Vegas casino worker in 1970 when she met Cosby. Autumn Burns (left) said she was 20 in 1970 when she met Cosby at the casino where she worked in Las Vegas. She says he gave her alcohol then forced her into sex acts.

She said he asked her to take him to the Playboy Mansion, where he offered her a drink that left her feeling drugged . Speaking out: Burns (foreground) said she felt 'out of control' after drinking the alcohol Cosby gave her . She said she was invited to his suite where he made her a drink, leaving her feeling 'woozy and not in control.' She said the comedian then forced her into sex acts. Tate said she met Cosby in Chicago in 1975, when she was a 27-year-old model. She said he asked her to take him to the Playboy Mansion, where he offered her a drink that left her feeling drugged.

Emotional: Kinney wept alongside her attorney Allred as she gave a detailed account of her allegations . Embrace: Allred, who represents many of Cosby's 38 accusers, hugged the women after they spoke . Growing case: The three women, who have not spoken out before, are the latest in almost 40 women to do so . Allred said her Thursday conference was held purposely held before Cosby's May 2 Atlanta show. 'I hope that the public will not buy tickets to his performance and that there will be many empty seats by the end of his performance,' Allred said. Cosby, best known for his America's Dad character Dr. Cliff Huxtable on the top-rated Cosby Show, has never been charged over any of the allegations. He settled a 2005 civil lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct. Representatives for Cosby did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Cosby's attorney Marty Singer has previously dismissed similar allegations made by other women as 'discredited' and 'defamatory.'","Two former casino workers and a former model spoke out for the first time .

"The small college town of Missoula, Montana, best known for its university and its inhabitants’ fierce love of football, has been branded in the media America's Rape Capital, and now bestselling author Jon Krakauer has made it the subject of his new book documenting the explosive allegations. Missoula: Rape and The Justice System in a College Town, a Doubleday publication that was released Tuesday, immediately sparked a fierce debate in Montana and beyond. Krakauer, the author of the critically acclaimed book Into the Wild, sat down for an interview with ABC's Nightline, which aired Wednesday night, to discuss his latest project exploring the sensitive subject of campus rape. Brave: Kelsey Belnap (left) and Allison Huguet (right) were among the five women profiled by author Jon Krakauer fopr his new book about sexual assault at the University of Montana at Missoula. Miss Belnap allegedly had been gang-raped by four college football players, but they were never charged . Survivor speaks: Hillary McLaughlin had been raped by the same football player who attacked Allison Huguet during a party in 2010. She later testified against him (pictured) Convicted rapist: Grizzly running back Beau Donaldson, Huguet and McLaughlin's attacker, pleaded guilty to rape in 2012 and was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison . Jon Krakauer argued that rape allegations were not unique to the picturesque town nestled in the Rocky Mountains, pointing out that Missoula’s sexual abuse statistics were average, or even slightly below the national average. 'If this problem could exist in Missoula, it could exist anywhere in the country, and it does.’ he said. ‘Rape is this huge problem, 80 per cent of rapes are unreported.’ In an effort to shed light on the rape epidemic and spark a national conversation, Krakauer had interviewed five alleged victims of rape for his book, among them Kelsey Belnap, who revealed that during her sophomore year at the University of Montana, she was gang-raped by four members of the beloved local Grizzy football team. Speaking to Nightline, Miss Belnap said on the night of the alleged attack in December 2010, she was playing drinking games at an off-campus party celebrating the end of the finals. Explosive: Bestsellng author and journalist Jon Krakauer released Missoula: Rape and the Justice System In a College Town on April 21 . She downed up to 11 shots of 99-proof alcohol within an hour and soon was slipping in and out of consciousness. 'I don't remember bits and pieces until I had a penis in my face,’ she recalled. According to Belnap, she pushed away the first football player who tried to have sex with her and told him she didn't want to sleep with him, but he forced himself on her, followed by three of his teammates. At some point, she passed out during the suspected attack. When the sophomore came to, she headed to a hospital and filed a police report. But according to Miss Belnap, investigating officers were far from sympathetic. ‘They made it seem like it was alcohol,’ she said. ‘That it was my fault, that I had drank too much, and if I wouldn't have drank too much, it wouldn't have happened.’ Belnap argued that it wasn't alcohol that crossed a line and 'stuck a penis' in her face that night - it was four Grizzly football players. In the end, Missoula prosecutors ruled that there was no probable cause to charge Belnap's alleged attackers. Police and prosecutors said that Belnap had told investigators the men 'would have likely believed it was consensual sex’ - a claim that was repeated by the players and several witnesses at the party. Miss Belnap also made a statement to police that she was so drunk that night she did not resist the men's advances. The Missoula County attorney argued that the student was not legally incapacitated because she was going in and out of consciousness. Under state law, a victim cannot give consent to sex if he or she is 'mentally defective or incapacitated.' After her case was essentially tossed out, Belnap turned to university officials, and there things went a little better for her: one of her alleged attackers was expelled from school, another agreed to leave voluntarily and the other two had dropped out earlier. Krakauer's new book also features the story of another young woman, Allison Huguet, who was also raped by a University of Montana football player whom she has known since childhood. Huguet had left Montana to attend an out-of-state college but returned to Missoula in December 2010 for a party with her long-time friend, Beau Donaldson. Huguet said she had been drinking and was in no condition to drive home that night, so she settled in for the night on the couch. Belnap (left) claimed four players gang-raped her in 2010, but prosecutors never charged them citing lack of probable cause . 'And I woke up to a lot of pain, and a lot of pressure, and the sound of somebody moaning, and quickly realized it was Beau,’ Huguet said. ‘I just shut my eyes and laid there, and that wasn't, I don't even think a decision, I consciously made.’ Allison Huguet said after the act, Donaldson got up, pulled up his pants and threw a blanket on her. Once he was out of earshot, she fled the house barefoot and called her mother for help. As she was on the phone telling her mother Donaldson had raped her, she realized the hulking running back was chasing her. Backlash: Missoula County Attorney Kirsten Pabst on Wednesday called Jon Krakauer's allegations 'inaccurate, exaggerated, and unnecessarily personal' According to the woman, the Grizzy player begged her not to tell anyone what happened. After she finally got away from him, Huguet went to a hospital and underwent a rape kit exam, but at first she decided not to get the police involved. Instead, Huguet and her mother invited Donaldson over to their home and secretly recorded their conversation, which eventually yielded a confession. At first, Donaldson tried to blame their encounter on alcohol, but eventually he changed his story, saying on the audio recording: 'It's something I did and I f***ed up.' He went on to say that he came close to killing himself the night of the attack. 'I was curled up on my couch in the carport with my f***ing handgun in my hand. You have no idea,' he lamented. Huguet, in turn, made her childhood friend promise her he would get help. In exchange, she said she would not go to the police. But more than a year later, Huguet learned that Donaldson hadn't sought counselling like he had promised and contacted the authorities. During an interview with police, the star Grizzy player confessed to the rape. As she was struggling to push her case forward in the months following Donaldson’s arrest, Huguet discovered that another young woman, Hillary McLaughlin, had accused him of raping her in 2008 but she never reported the attack to police. . In an interview with Nightline, McLaughlin said she is filled with remorse because she could have possibly prevented the attack on Allison Huguet had she blown the whistle on Donaldson seven years ago. During Donaldson's trial, McLaughlin finally shared her story in court, helping seal the defendant's fate. Changes: The university created a small sexual assault prevention department last year and its athletic department created a new Code of Conduct that addresses sexual assault . The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012 . In September 2012, Beau Donaldson, the former star of the Grizzlies, pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. He will be up for parole in July. The disturbing news from Missoula prompted the US Department of Justice to launch an investigation into the University of Montana, the local police department and the prosecutor's office. The federal probe found that between 2008 and 2012, only 14 of the 85 total rape cases were sent by police to the prosecutor. Justice Department investigators determined that the Missoula County attorney declined to prosecute nearly every case where drugs or alcohol played a role - even when the rapist had confessed. A June 2014 agreement ended the investigation, with the county agreeing to implement sweeping changes, including the creation of a special victims unit and the assignment of trained prosecutors to sexual assault cases. The university itself has created a small sexual assault prevention department last year with a coordinator and three interns, and its athletic department created a new Code of Conduct that addresses sexual assault, according to the Montana Kaimin. 'Missoula is a much safer place for women now than it was when I first started looking at it in 2012,' Krakauer said. Missoula County Attorney Kirsten Pabst on Wednesday held a press conference to address the issues raised by Jon Krakauer's latest book. 'While the charges that the author has made against me, my office, my predecessor, are inaccurate, exaggerated, and unnecessarily personal, he is correct. In that our investigation and prosecution standards needed to be improved,' she stated. Mr Krakauer, pictured speaking in 2009, is the best selling author of works such as Into Thin Air and Into the Wild . While Mr Krakauer's story focuses on Montana, the book's scope is more global. Missoula is described as 'a typical college town' and Mr Krakauer's website said that rape victims are 'deserving of compassion from society and fairness from a justice system that is clearly broken'. Mr Krakauer decided to write the book 'after learning that a young woman with whom he and his wife have a close relationship suffered intensely in secret for many years after she was raped by a man she trusted,' according to USA Today. Sexual assault and rape have become issues at campuses across the country, with victims speaking out against the way that universities dealt with their allegations. Ninety-four colleges and universities were under investigation by the Department of Justice for their handling of sexual assault cases as of the beginning of this year. Mr Krakauer's book says that it 'cuts through the abstract ideological debate about campus rape'. The writer's other works include Into the Wild, Under the Banner of Heaven and Into Thin Air, for which he was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.","Author of 'Into the Wild' spoke to five rape victims in Missoula, Montana .

"Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton issued a pointed defense of her family foundation on Thursday after allegations surfaced that it reaped millions from foreign countries that had issues pending before her mother when she was secretary of state. 'What the Clinton Foundation has said is that we will be even more transparent' in the wake of the scandalous claims, said Chelsea, the philanthropy's vice chair, 'even though Transparency International and others have said we're among the most transparent of foundations.' Clinton, the daughter of former U.S. president Bill Clinton and presumptive Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, spoke during an event on women and girls at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Chelsea Clinton defended her family philanthropy on Thursday in New York, calling it 'among the most transparent of foundations' The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation is under fire for allegedly accepting millions from foreign entities in exchange for special favors from the State Department when Hillary Clinton was at its helm . Hillary Clinton (seen Wednesday at Georgetown University) was helping approve Russia's purchase of US uranium production as her foundation received millions from executives tied to the deal . ABC News hosted the event, and reported that Chelsea outlined what she said is 'the right policy. That we'll be even more transparent. That to eliminate any questions while we're in this time, we won't take new government funding, but that the work will continue as it is.' The foundation recently committed to stop taking donations from foreign governments but insisted it wouldn't return money it has already collected. That hasn't sat well with Republicans vying for their party's presidential nomination: Hillary Clinton is Public Enemy Number One on the campaign trail, and they smell blood. 'Having raised tens of millions of dollars from foreign nations presents a clear conflict of interest for anyone running for President of the United States,' Texas Sen. Ted Cruz wrote Wednesday on Facebook . Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who hasn't formally entered the 2016 hunt, told Daily Mail Online that 'not only should they definitely give back the money and cease accepting foreign donations, but should also make every effort to find missing documents that would shed light if in fact they are innocent.' More problems: The Clinton Foundation erroneously reported it had received no funds from governments for three years – even though it previously received millions – and now has to refile its tax returns . Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly FIorina called the series of accusations against Bill and Hillary 'the Clinton way: raking in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors while making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep.' The Republican National Committee pounced as well. 'The new revelations reported by the New York Times continue to raise serious questions about Hillary Clinton's judgment and her handling of conflicts of interest surrounding the Clinton Foundation while serving as Secretary of State,' RNC spokeswoman Allison Moore said in a statement. Thursday's unrelenting news cycle about possible overlaps between the former first family's personal and charitable finances were prompted by details emerging about a new book titled 'Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.' The book, due in stores next month, reportedly includes evidence that Hillary Clinton doled out special State Department favors to governments – and for-profit companies tied to them – in exchange for foundation donations and six-figure speaking fes for Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon laid out a lengthy defense on Thursday, writing online that a New York Times article outlining the charges included no 'direct evidence in support of the claim' that Mrs. Clinton did anything wrong. Former president Bill Clinton (left) received $500,000 for a Moscow speaking engagement with Renaissance Capital. He also met Vladimir Putin (right), at the time Russia's prime minister, during the visit . This week in New Hampshire, Hillary herself brushed off the brewing scandal. 'We're back into the political scene, and therefore we will be subjected to all kinds of distractions and I'm ready for it,' she told reporters in the town of Keene. 'I know that comes unfortunately with the territory.' 'It is, I think, worth noting that the Republicans seem to be talking only about me,' she added. 'They wouldn't have anything to talk about if I weren't in the race. But I am in the race, and hopefully we'll get onto the issues, and I look forward to that.' Mrs. Clinton herself has yet to outline any serious public policy positions in connection with her run for the White House.","Former first daughter is now vice chair of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation .

"Finding the time to exercise when you've got heaps of housework - and laundry - piling up can be difficult, but this piece of gym kit means you've got no excuse not to work up a sweat. Chinese designers have developed an contraption called the Bike Washing Machine that contains a washing machine drum in its front wheel. When ridden, the pedalling motion causes the drum to rotate, churning your clothes inside like a traditional washer. Chinese designers have developed a washing machine so cyclists can clean clothes while exercising (above) A generator inside the bike also creates electricity which can be stored for future use. The designers,  based at Dalian Nationalities University, do not say whether the bike will automatically fill and drain with water too. Instead, the detergent and water may need to be added and then drained before more water being added for a rinse cycle. They say, however, that the device could be a solution for those who want both a washing machine and an exercise bike but cannot find space for both. Alternatively it could also help shave a few pounds off your electricity bill by using pedal power to do the laundry. By changing the front wheel of the exercise bike into a washing machine drum it will spin as the user pedals . A generator attached to the pedals (shown above) also produces electricity which can be stored for later use . The invention could also find use in remote areas where people do not have access to reliable supplies of electricity. Students at the university are now building a prototype of the machine. The group submitted the design onto the website Tuvie,which allows designers to share their ideas. They said: 'Riding a bike is a popular exercise, washing laundry is something that you might do on daily basis or at least once a week, unless you keep buying new clothes and underwear, so why not combine them into a single useful equipment/appliance? The designers say the device is perfect for those struggling to find space for both a washing machine and an exercise bike . 'Bike Washing Machine combines a stationary bicycle and washing machine, you can exercise while at the same time simultaneously washing your clothes. 'When you ride this bike, the pedalling motion causes the drum of the washing machine to rotate, at the same time, the superfluous electricity is generated which can be used to power the display screen or stored for future use.' It is not the first time cycling and the weekly wash have been combined. In 2011 Richard Hewitt, a design student at Sheffield Hallam University, announced he had developed a similar device that washes and dries clothes using pedal power. His Spincycle machine could be attached to the back of a tricycle. Riding the bike for 10 minutes would wash the clothes before the water needed to be drained and refilled before another 10 minute cycle rinsed the clothes. If cycling and doing your washing at the same time does not appeal, then perhaps another device that combines a treadmill with a washing machine. Looking more like a giant hamster wheel, it features a series of wash tubs enclosed within a large rotating wheel. The Wheel washing machine, dreamed up by South Korean designer Si Hyeong Ryu, would also generate electricity that could be used to power other household appliances. Ryu created the concept for the 2014 Electrolux Design Lab competition. The Wheel concept features washing balls inside the canisters, designed to save water and improve washing .","The Bike Washing Machine replaces the front wheel with a washing drum .
It is being developed by designers at Dalian Nationalities University, China .
It means cyclists can save electricity by washing clothes as they exercise ."
"Eloise Parry, known as Ella, 21, died this week after taking a lethal overdose of diet pills . This week, a 21-year-old university student died after taking a lethal dose of diet pills. Eloise Parry, known as Ella, 'burned up from the inside, after swallowing the highly-toxic substance known as Dinitrophenol, or DNP. After taking the tablets her metabolism began to soar and she started to overheat. While  doctors desperately tried to stabilise her, she died just three hours later. Her mother issued a stark warning about buying diet pills online, saying her daughter never intended to take her own life, she just didn't understand the danger of taking an overdose of the  tablets. Here, Dr Simon Cotton, a senior lecturer in chemistry at the University of Birmingham, explains how DNP came to be used as a diet pill, and why it the chemical is so dangerous… . Writing for The Conversation, Dr Cotton said: Eloise Aimee Parry was the latest of a string of young people to fall victim to the chemical 2,4-dinitrophenol, known as DNP. It is a very dangerous chemical and scientists have been aware of this for nearly a century. During World War I, DNP was sometimes used to fill armour-piercing shells, as a mixture with picric acid, known as Shellite or Tridite. An explosion in a munitions factory at Rainham in Essex in 1916 was attributed to the chemical. Just like TNT it was found to be toxic to the munitions workers handling it. Many of them lost weight dramatically and some even died simply by absorbing it through their skin. The commercial use of DNP is as a pesticide or herbicide and, in 2009, 11 workers in a Chinese chemical factory – plus nine of their relatives – contracted DNP poisoning, their skins turned yellow or even black and two died. After World War I, scientists at Stanford University investigated DNP to see if it was a useful slimming aid. They established that the chemical boosted metabolism by up to 50 per cent, leading to considerable weight loss without dieting. Eloise Parry, known as Ella, 'burned up from the inside, after swallowing the highly-toxic substance known as Dinitrophenol, or DNP . Ella's mother said her daughter never intended to take her own life, she just didn't understand the danger of taking an overdose of the tablets. Ella is pictured in 2001 . However, they also found out that there were a number of side effects (including cataracts) and that the safety margin was too slim. Firms started selling it direct to customers which meant that people were taking it without medical supervision – and fatalities resulted. When one man died, they measured his temperature – it was 110°F (43°C). DNP was banned in the United States under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938; the US Food and Drug Administration said that DNP was too toxic to be used under any circumstance. Fiona Parry, 51, has issued a stark warning against diet pills following her daughter's death . DNP went underground for years, but it was again marketed in the 1980s as a ""weight-loss without dieting"" drug – and, more recently, the internet has given it a wider circulation, describing it as a ""safe weight-loss drug"". Anything but. Extravagant claims were made by people who said that they lost 20 pounds in 12 days by taking it; it was promoted as 'the king of the fat-loss drugs'. And of course the health problems and fatalities associated with its use returned. Not for human consumption . How DNP works was discovered in 1948. The chemical helps to move protons across membranes in cells. This results in a reduction in the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate, the molecule that transports energy within cells, the body's 'energy currency'). This means that much of the energy usually generated in respiration is instead wasted as heat (which can lead to fatal hyperthermia). The body compensates by speeding up metabolism in order to produce the energy needed to maintain the body. This increase in metabolic rate results in the consumption of fat and carbohydrate as they are turned into energy. The people marketing it may hedge around with labels saying ""not for human consumption"", but obviously consumers do not get the guidance that would be given if they were getting a medication from their doctor. A 27-year-old woman who wanted to lose weight bought some over the internet; she wanted faster results so she took double the recommended dose. It killed her. There have been a number of fatalities in the UK caused by DNP. In 2013, an 18-year-old rugby player named Chris Mapletoft died after taking DNP. Scientists warn DNP is highly toxic. It was originally used in weapons in World War 1 and is used commercially as a pesticide . The preceding year a 28-year old High Wycombe bodybuilder, Sean Cleathero, died after his temperature rose to 42°C when he consumed DNP at his gym. That same year a 23-year-old Leeds University medical student, Sarah Houston, died after consuming DNP that she'd bought over the internet. Her father said: 'For those who are selling it, if you have any ounce of decency, you must stop.' In 2004 the UK Food Standards Agency advised consumers not to take any product containing DNP at any level: ""This chemical is not suitable for human consumption."" All sorts of promises are made on the internet about DNP. But if something sounds too good to be true, then it probably isn't. In the case of 2,4-dinitrophenol, it's also deadly.","DNP was a chemical used in weapons in WW1 and was found to be toxic .
It was also commercially used as a pesticide and poisoned workers .
Was banned as a diet pill after scientists discovered its risky side effects .

"The Residence: Inside The Private World Of The White House . by Kate Andersen Brower . (Harper £18.99) For Americans, the White House is as iconic and royal a palace as you can get. For non-Americans, it is a respected power symbol,but not one to be especially loved. Kate Brower, an American journalist assigned to cover the Obama White House, became intrigued by the workings of the mansion after watching Downton Abbey.She set about interviewing the staff, who number at least 100, to build up a comparable picture of the American version of Upstairs, Downstairs. The staff all live out in Washington and commute in. The hours are long. Those on duty cannot go home until the President retires and goes to bed. So they see little of their families and are often divorced as a result. The pay is not great, but the job is prestigious and passed by personal recommendation among friends. Most of them have stayed there for 20 years or more. Ronald Reagan (pictured with his wife, Nancu) , on the other hand, was over-chummy, so eager to talk to them that servants actually tried to dodge him in order not to get caught for hours . The West Wing is the President’s office quarters; the East Wing belongs to the First Lady and her office staff. ‘The Residence’, as the living quarters are called, really begins on the second floor and is kept hidden from the hundreds of tourists who parade through the state rooms every afternoon. Keeping the organisation running smoothly, from the workshops in the basement to the snipers on the roof, is a complex operation. It costs money — $13 million a year from government funds, plus a hefty contribution from the First Family itself. Presidents and their wives have to pay for their own food and drink and that of their personal guests. They are also charged for dry-cleaning. Even well-heeled First Ladies are always appealing to keep the bills down, especially in the kitchens where top chefs are above such considerations as cost. Jackie Kennedy was heard to complain: ‘We haven’t nearly as much money as you read in the papers’; while the Carters even asked the kitchen to serve them leftovers for their personal meals. The White House is never untenanted. The changeover of President takes place at 12 noon on Inauguration Day. Between then and 5pm, the entire moving out and in of the two families and their respective belongings has to be completed. The staff include ushers, chefs, maids, doormen, engineers, plumbers, full-time florists (the flower bill is enormous), even calligraphers who are kept busy writing invitations in fine script. But the glory of the place is its corps of butlers — six of them full-time, plus dozens more called in for big receptions, parties and dinners. Even well-heeled First Ladies are always appealing to keep the bills down, Jackie Kennedy (pictured with her John F Kennedy) was heard to complain: ‘We haven’t nearly as much money as you read in the papers’ Most, by tradition, are black. There is a picture of ten of them taking a break between courses in their black ties. What is the collective noun for such a fine body of men? A bevy of butlers? The Kennedys and the Clintons liked staying up late and entertaining until 2am, which meant that those on duty didn’t get home until much later than that. This didn’t go down well. Oddly enough, the best-liked couple were the older Bushes — George H. W. and his wife, Barbara, who were used to having plenty of servants and were relaxed and genuinely concerned about them. The black staff, especially the elderly butlers who remembered segregation, are especially proud to serve the Obamas as the first black presidential family. One found Obama and his wife, Michelle, celebrating gaining The White House on their first night there with an impromptu dance to a record by Mary J. Blige. And yet the Obamas have turned out to be rather reserved and distant with the staff — even, says one, ‘stand-offish’. Ronald Reagan, on the other hand, was over-chummy, so eager to talk to them that servants actually tried to dodge him in order not to get caught for hours. He had a disconcerting habit of sitting around naked reading the newspapers. His wife, Nancy, by contrast, was a martinet who collected Limoges china. Woe betide anyone who broke a piece. She would call a servant to say that the lights needed turning on when the switch was within easy reach. When she was going to be difficult about the meal service, which was frequently, she would send for the chef, cock her head on one side and smile — and then find fault, usually with the desserts served by chef Roland Mesnier. Unlike some presidential couples, the Clintons (pictured) used to share a bedroom — until the Lewinsky scandal - when Bill was relegated to the sofa in the study for a matter of time . Once, she decided at the last moment that the dessert for a state dinner should be sugar baskets each containing three sugar tulips. Chef Roland objected: ‘But there are only two days left until the dinner!’ She cocked her head: ‘Roland, you have two days and two nights before the dinner.’ Richard Nixon installed a bowling alley in the basement. He used to wander into the kitchens for a chat and discovered a washer-up who was also a keen bowler. They went on playing until 2am. Nixon then wrote a note to the man’s wife to explain why he was so late home. The Carters made news by appointing a convicted murderess as nanny to their daughter, Amy. Rosalynn Carter was convinced she was innocent, and the first family’s confidence was justified when the verdict was reversed. Unlike some presidential couples, the Clintons used to share a bedroom — until the Lewinsky scandal reached its height in 1998. For three or four months, Hillary made Bill sleep on a sofa in a study attached to the bedroom. Most women on the staff thought he’d got what he deserved. The feuding Clintons were the talk of the staff, who overheard their bad language and the sound of objects being thrown in bedrooms. Hillary’s voice screaming ‘Goddam bastard!’ was followed by a heavy thud. Much blood was discovered all over the bed. No one believed that her husband, who needed several stitches, had walked into a bathroom door in the dark, as he explained. ‘We’re pretty sure she clocked him with a book,’ said one member of staff. There were certainly plenty to hand — there were at least 20 on the Clintons’ bedside tables, including the Bible. But the biggest disturber of the peace was the huge bully from Texas, Lyndon B. Johnson, who succeeded the assassinated J. F. Kennedy. He gloried in his size (6 ft 3 in) and his achievements. He had TV sets installed everywhere and kept several on loudly as he watched himself in the newscasts. He undressed in front of the staff and gave them instructions while sitting on the lavatory, whose seat had to be replaced with a bigger one when he broke it. He drove the plumbers to nervous breakdowns over his shower. It was never hot enough nor strong enough for him. They replaced one after the other until the water came out as if from a fire hose and the heat generated set off the fire alarm. One water jet had to be aimed precisely at his penis (which he called ‘Jumbo’) and another up his rear end. He raged at the plumbers until he got satisfaction. Such was the man who escalated the Vietnam War.","For non-Americans the White House it is a respected power symbol .

"Patriotic countrymen and women turned out in their finest red and white today to enjoy St George's Day celebrations in the sunshine. Veteran parades and Morris men were seen across the country, with spectators draped in flags cheering them on. Described by the Prime Minister as 'a day to be celebrate all that makes England great', St George's Day takes place on April 23 every year. With temperatures of around 20C in parts of the country, planned outdoor events were able to go forward. Among them was the annual Nottingham St George's Day Parade which attracted around 200 people. Joined by trucks and horses, the crowd marched through the city centre from Forest Recreation Ground earlier today.

Crowds basked in temperatures of up to 20C in some parts of the country today after a spell of unusually warm weather for this time of year . In Emsworth in Hampshire a group of veterans led the festivities. The men, who belonged to 12 Regiment Royal Artillery, led a procession through the town centre. Their parade was also to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. In the City of London, Morris men brightened up Leadenhall Market, dancing through the shopping arcade to the amusement of workers on their lunch break. Temperatures were slightly warmer across England today than on St George's Day last year, with parts of north Yorkshire the warmest at 20.9C. It comes after a week of abnormally warm weather that is set to end tomorrow, said forecasters. 'There is certainly a change on the way, as of tomorrow we'll see wetter fronts,' said Helen Roberts, a Met Office forecaster. 'The first will be affecting south west England and Wales with some rain pushing in through the afternoon on Friday. 'A cold front will creep across Scotland and will be pretty slow moving. That will reach southern England on Sunday bringing some heavy rain at times.' Two women don face masks to take part in the festivities in Nottingham this morning.

Asked whether a 3rd Century Ukip politician would have welcomed the saint, the party's economic spokesman Patrick O'Flynn joked: 'Well, I guess dragon-slaying is a skill but whether it is one that's in short supply for the needs of the British economy, we will leave to our migration commission. 'Whenever the issue of St George's Day comes up - and I can predict this on Twitter today - there will be many left-centre people who will tweet the fact that St George was from what's today known as Turkey as if that is the start, finish of conversation and that makes St George's Day irrelevant or illegitimate or ridiculous. 'I completely disagree ... I'm not particularly hung up on where St George came from. I'm more interested in what St George's Day can represent.'

"A mother was removed from a train and taken away in a police van because she took home a clothes horse she had found 'abandoned' in a carriage. Aimee Craven, of Hull, East Yorkshire, had claimed the Tesco product worth £20 and taken it home after spotting it on a train the previous week - because she thought it had been left by its owner. But British Transport Police officers trawled through CCTV footage to track down the 32-year-old care worker before taking her off a train as she travelled to work in Brough. Police investigation: Mother-of-one Aimee Craven, of Hull, East Yorkshire, was accused of trying to shield the £20 Tesco clothes horse from CCTV as she walked off the train in Brough (above) with it . Miss Craven - who is now waiting to see if she will be charged, but has been told it is likely she will receive a caution for theft - said: ‘I was the first person to get on the train and I spotted it. ‘I know the right thing to do would have been to hand it in but I thought, “I’ll have it”. It was a spur of the moment, stupid decision, which I am sorry for. ‘But I don’t think what I did justifies everything that then happened. The police got on the train, asked me to step off it and I had no idea what it was about. ‘Everyone was looking at me. I was absolutely traumatised, it was awful. They asked me if I’d taken it and I told them the truth. They said it was theft.’ Police insisted to MailOnline that she was not arrested - and told how the victim was on the train at the time of the theft, and had placed the clothes horse behind her seat while travelling. After being taken off the train, Miss Craven was driven home in a police van and asked how long she had lived at her address and whether she owned the property. Facing a caution for theft: Miss Craven was asked by British Transport Police to go for questioning at their offices at Hull Paragon (above), where she was given a solicitor, paid for by legal aid . She was also said to have been asked where she worked, how long she had worked there, which shifts she did and what time she finished. Miss Craven was then made to take her wet clothes off the airer she had been using for a week, while police waited to confiscate the item. The mother-of-one, who cares for the elderly, was then allegedly asked to attend a police station for questioning where she had her DNA taken from a mouth swab and was fingerprinted. She said: ‘When I got home and went in and said the police are here for the clothes horse my boyfriend thought I was joking. ‘He said, “Oh very funny, April Fools’ was ages ago”. Then when I started taking the clothes off he said, “Aimee I think you are going too far now”. He just didn’t believe me until he saw me giving it to the police.’ The officers then asked Miss Craven to go back for questioning at their offices at Hull Paragon, where she was given a solicitor, paid for by legal aid. She was accused of trying to shield the item from CCTV as she walked off the train in Brough. Miss Craven, who has no convictions, said: ‘They made me feel like I was Hull’s most wanted. It really has been the worst experience of my life. With all the questions and them prying into my life I was petrified. ‘My solicitor said even if you found something in a skip and took it you could be done for theft and so he advised me to admit theft to get a caution, otherwise it would go to court. ‘The whole thing is ridiculous, it’s cost a lot more than the price of the clothes horse. I’d have happily bought her a new one. It’s a complete waste of their time and taxpayers’ money. ‘I’ve had to admit theft to get a caution, which I don’t agree with and I’ve now got a criminal record.’ A British Transport Police spokesman told MailOnline: ‘Following the alleged theft of a clothes horse from the 7.10am Hull to King's Cross service on April 9, a 32-year-old woman from Hull was interviewed after she voluntary attended Hull police station. 'The rightful owner of the clothes horse had placed it behind her seat and discovered it was missing when the train arrived at Brough station approximately 15 minutes later. She contacted police after seeing a woman walking along the platform carrying it. 'The woman was identified after officers reviewed CCTV from the station and undertook an anniversary visit. The item was recovered and has been returned to its owner. She has thanked officers for their actions. 'British Transport Police treats all reports of theft reported to us seriously, regardless of the item stolen, and will investigate every offence thoroughly.'","Aimee Craven, 32, took home Tesco product after spotting it on train .

"Talk about gobby! This little fellow has been born with FIVE mouths - believed to be the most ever seen on a calf. The strange-looking baby opens all ten lips when he is sucking at his mother's udders. But he can only take in milk through two of his mouths. He is being fed three times a day at the dairy farm where he was born, in Narnaul, northern India. Scroll down for video . On everyone's lips: This calf in northern India has five mouths and is attracting a stream of human visitors . Normal body: From the neck down the baby, who has been called Nandi, looks like any other calf . Dinner time: Nandi sucks from his mother's udders with one of his mouths. She feeds him three times a day . Shocked locals have called the calf Nandi - a nickname for Lord Krishna. It can also mean 'one who pleases others'. In India's Hindu culture, cows are revered as a symbol of life. Nandi is attracting a constant stream of visitors wanting to celebrate him. Many of them kneel before him to pray and touch his hooves. Local vet Sukhbir Singh said that despite Nandi's appearance, he is healthy and thriving. But the calf's two eyes are positioned in such a way on his distorted head that he can only see to his sides and can't look in front of him. One eye is blue and the other black. Other strange-looking bovine have been recorded in recent years, including a buffalo with three mouths and three eyes that was in in 2009, also in northern India, in 2009. Last month a bull with two faces - one on top the other - was sold to an abattoir in Queensland, Australia. The 440kg animal fetched around £300 in the auction at Mareeba Livestock Yard. Celebrating him: Local schoolchildren kneel and pray at Nandi's feet. Cows are revered in the Hindu faith . Garlanded: Wreaths such as those around the calf's neck are traditionally used in India during worship . Baby teeth: One of Nandi's mouths is clearly bigger than the others, which hang around his face . Two years ago, an American farm revealed it had a calf with two heads but only one brain. Vets said the little heifer, in Whiting, Vermont, was meant to be a twin but the egg did not separate properly in the womb. Each head mimicked the other, meaning when she was feeding with one of her mouths, her other mouth was sucking too.

"All three of the main parties’ education spokesmen revealed they would have no problem with the next Education Secretary sending their children to private school. The outbreak of honesty among politicians came when the BBC’s Daily Politics show presenter Andrew Neil, asked if it would be a ‘acceptable for an education secretary to send their children to a private school’. Tristram Hunt, Labour’s shadow education secretary answered first and said: ‘Yes. In certain circumstances’. He also confirmed Labour could fire the thousands of ‘unqualified’ teachers across the state sector. All three of the main parties’ education spokesmen - pictured on the BBC's Daily Politics show today - revealed they would have no problem with the next Education Secretary sending their children to private school . Two of his three children go to a state primary school in north London, with the third expected to go to the same school. But he has not ruled out switching them to independent schools. In contrast, Labour leader Ed Miliband refused to publicly support Labour’s deputy Scottish Leader, Anas Sarwar, when he chose to send his son to a private school in Glasgow. Privately-educated Schools Minister David Laws – who has no children - immediately said ‘yes’ when asked whether a future education secretary should be able to send their children private. And Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, who was privately educated but sends her son to a state primary, said: ‘Yes, you do what’s right for the child.’ Ukip’s James Arnott and the Green Party’s James Humphreys also agreed that there was no problem with a future Education Secretary sending their children private – although Mr Arnott added it would be an ‘indictment’ of the quality of state schools. Just seven per cent of children in the UK are privately educated. Ukip has pledged to bring back grammar schools by converting some existing comprehensives but Mrs Morgan said it would be a ‘step backwards’ and the plan ‘does not respect the outstanding schools that we see up and down the country’. Tristram Hunt, Labour’s shadow education secretary, was asked if it was acceptable for an Education Secretary to send their child private. He said: ‘Yes. In certain circumstances’ The rare frankness about whether they would send their children private is in stark contrast to the controversy sparked by Labour left-winger Diane Abbott, who sent her son to the exclusive fee-paying City of London school. Miss Abbott had previously criticised Harriet Harman, now Labour’s deputy leader, for sending her children to a selective grammar school. While many politicians on the Left have avoided paying to send their children to get the best education, they have managed to get them into elite taxpayer-funded schools. Both Tony Blair – who converted to Catholicism after standing down – and atheist Nick Clegg, bagged places at leading London Oratory for their children. Both men are married to Catholics. Put to the three main party spokesmen that they were all privately educated and Oxbridge graduates, Mr Hunt agreed that the ‘circle is tightening’ on top professions. Mr Hunt also signalled Labour would sack all the ‘unqualified’ teachers by the end of their first term in government if they had not signed up to training. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who stopped for a selfie with passers by at Sheffield railway station today, has vowed to halt the Coalition's education reforms . The Prime Minister, campaigning with supporters in Cornwall today, has vowed to turn all failing schools into academies . Some 17,000 teachers do not have ‘Qualified Teacher Status’ after Michael Gove, the previous Tory Education Secretary, waived the rules to attract more professionals and subject experts into schools. But Mr Hunt said Labour would be prepared to fire them. ‘At the end of a parliament, if you’re not qualified or working towards qualified teacher status, we don’t think that you’ve shown the enthusiasm and the respect to your pupils.... you don’t deserve to be in the classroom…we need high quality teaching.” He said firing them would be ‘a sign of the respect we attach to teachers’. ‘We think it is a demanding, fulfilling profession. We don’t think anyone can turn up to be a teacher. You need training,’ he said. Mr Hunt himself is technically unqualified but occasionally teaches history in London schools and university. He did not reveal if he had plans to fire himself should Labour win the election.","Main parties' school spokesmen backed right to opt out of state education .

"A 33-year-old woman on trial for having sex with a male inmate at Washington County Jail six times over four months while working as a services technician cried in court Wednesday as a judge rejected her request to use an insanity defense. Brett Robinson will now stand trial next week on 12 charges related to sexual misconduct and official misconduct, on allegations that she let the inmate out of his cell multiple times and engaging in sex acts between March and July last year. Robinson was hoping to present a psychologists report as evidence of mental disease or defect. The report said she was suffering from mental illness at the time of the alleged encounters and that it made her  'vulnerable, passive and gullible'. However at a motion hearing, Circuit Judge Andrew Erwin ruled the evidence was insufficient and that Robinson would have to go to trial on April 28 without it. The judge went in favor of the prosecution, who said the report should have been filed as evidence last year if the defense were going to argue insanity. Defense denied: A judge ruled Wednesday that attorneys for Brett Robinson, 33, waited too long to file an insanity defense, ruling evidence that she was suffering from mental illness when she engaged in sex acts with a prison inmate last year as insufficient . Charged: Robinson allegedly brought the male inmate into the control where she worked at Washing County Jail and had sex with him on his birthday under a blanket . State law says that defendants should file notice regarding evidence of mental disease or defect when they plead not guilty, Oregon Live reported. The judge said the defense filing it on April 10 was 'untimely' and that he didn't want to delay the trial. The case follows that of her colleague Lisa Curry, 39, who last month was sentenced to over four years prison for repeatedly having sex with a 25-year-old gang member and convicted rapist. Robinson, who worked in a maximum security control room known as 'the bubble', struck up a relationship with the inmate - who has not been named -  in a nearby cell. The two would talk using an intercom when Robinson's manager left the room. According to the psychologist's report obtained by   Robinson felt flattered by the compliments she got from the inmate and started to 'open up to him' early last year.Then, in March, the inmate asked for a kiss on his birthday. When her manager went to lunch, Robinson released the inmate from his cell and brought him into the bubble. She thought it strange that he brought a blanket with him from the cell, the report said. 'He kissed me so passionately, I was taken aback. 'I asked about the blanket. 'He said ''I was hoping we could go farther''. 'Then he was saying ''we don't have time to discuss this'', so I had sex with him.' New protocol: In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again . On trial: Brett Robinson, 33, faces charges of first-degree custodial sexual misconduct and first-degree official misconduct . They continued having sexual encounters, the report said, and Robinson wrote the inmate a love letter that began with 'Hi Baby'. The letter said: 'I am hoping this letter will better convey the love I feel deep inside for you. ... You are a constant presence in my thoughts, fantasies and dreams, and I feel this pervasive emptiness without you by my side. It makes it hard to go about my normal daily activities when all I do is miss you. You are my everything, Baby – I could not envision my life without you in it.' However the relationship began to sour when Robinson started hearing about the abusive conduct of the inmate elsewhere in the prison. He had passed a sexually explicit note to a nurse and also pushed a female prisoner against a wall and kissed her. The psychologist noted that Robinson was delusional about the man. The report also said she had struggled with depression and anxiety since childhood. 'There is evidence that these delusions developed in this generally vulnerable, passive and gullible woman as part of a Major Depressive and Anxiety episode,' the doctor wrote. Robinson was caught when the inmate brought up their relationship to a prison employee during an investigation about Jill Curry. The prosecution is fighting against Robinson using the insanity defense. In March Curry was sentenced to four years and two months prison. That case was very similar to the allegations against Robinson. Curry was also a services technician and was convicted of letting gang member Jang-Li Delgado Galban, 25,  who was housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, out of his cell and have sex with him in a supply closet. Ex-Washington County Jail staffer Jill Curry, 39, cries in court last month as she was sentenced to more than four years in prison for repeatedly having sex with an inmate in a supply closet . Curry, who is married to a sheriff's deputy, pleaded guilty last month to custodial sexual misconduct and other charges stemming from her contact with Delgado Galban. Authorities said the sexual misconduct occurred while a deputy was at lunch, when Curry, a civilian jail services technician, was alone in the unit's control room, reports The Oregonian. Curry pushed a button to unlock the inmate's cell and the pair would then meet in the supply closet to have sexual relations. This occurred 13 times, said prosecutor Jeff Lesowski. A probation officer who conducted a pre-sentencing investigation had recommended a prison sentence of less than two years, which the defense asked the judge to impose. Judge Bailey went above the state's recommendation when sentencing Curry. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office first started their investigation into Curry's actions on July 8, 2014, when someone called into the professional standards unit to report the jail services technician. Curry had claimed that Jang-Li Delgado Galban, a 25-year-old gang member housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, had seduced her . Curry was placed on administrative leave that day, pending a criminal investigation. She had been working in the sheriff's office since October 2004, serving different parts of the jail including booking, inmate units and the control center. An article published in The Oregonian in 2010 said that in December 2009, Delgado-Galban, then 20 years old, allegedly broke into a woman's apartment in Hillsboro and raped her. The suspect later agreed to a plea deal, as part of which he admitted to one count of burglary with the intent to commit rape in exchange for having the rape charges dropped. In December 2010, Delgado-Galban was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison, and ordered to register as a sex offender upon his release. But according to sheriff's officials, he failed to meet the conditions of the plea agreement, which landed him behind bars in the Washington County Jail where he encountered Curry. In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again.","Brett Robinson, 33, facing 12 charges after allegedly letting an inmate out of his cell and engaging in sex acts between March and July last year .

"Nigel Farage's Ukip insist St George would have been welcomed to Britain because of his skills as a dragon slayer . He was a foreigner born in Turkey. But Ukip has insisted St George would have been welcomed to Britain because of his skills as a dragon slayer. Today on St George's Day, the party announced that it would make it a Bank Holiday in England. But at the policy launch, economic spokesman Patrick O'Flynn faced questions on whether St George would have been welcomed by a 3rd-century Ukip. In its election manifesto the party has said it would have a five year moratorium on unskilled migrants moving to the country. Mr O'Flynn said: 'Well, I guess dragon-slaying is a skill but whether it is one that's in short supply for the needs of the British economy, we will leave to our migration commission. 'Whenever the issue of St George's Day comes up - and I can predict this on Twitter today - there will be many left-centre people who will tweet the fact that St George was from what's today known as Turkey as if that is the start, finish of conversation and that makes St George's Day irrelevant or illegitimate or ridiculous. 'I completely disagree ... I'm not particularly hung up on where St George came from. I'm more interested in what St George's Day can represent. 'The party said it wanted to encourage more people to fly the St George's flag and end a 'cultural self-loathing' about being proud to be English. Peter Whittle, the party's culture and communities spokesman said: 'For too long we have lived with a political and cultural establishment which has shown a sort of disdain for England which has doubted Britain has a whole and has discouraged pride in it. Their embarrassment about our past, their lack of concern about our history has permeated our culture. 'Now many young people know little about the country in which they live. The patriotism of the many is often sneered at. We have a society that appears to live in a state of culture cringe. People have been encouraged to believe that national pride is exclusive, is dangerous, is bigoted and should therefore be discouraged.' He said that people who celebrate St George's Day should not be seen as 'racist'. He added: 'There is a sense somehow when it comes to a perfectly ordinary benign patriotism many people do feel that they are slightly concerned that if they say they are proud they are immediately going to be cast as racist, or bigoted or whatever. It is obviously completely untrue.' He said there was a 'snobbery about showing your pride in your country, that it is a vulgar thing'. Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to veterans at the Northwood Club in Ramsgate, Kent, today . In its election manifesto, Ukip has said it would have a five year moratorium on unskilled migrants moving to the country. Pictured is Ukip leader Nigel Farage celebrating St George's Day with a pint . Mr O'Flynn was also asked whether English people should be given priority access to public services over Scottish people who have moved south of the border. He said: 'Ukip believes in the UK. I don't think there is any distinction between the right of someone from Scotland and the right of someone from England to access public services.' St George is thought to have born in in the late third century in Cappadocia, which is now part of Turkey. He was a soldier under the Emperor Diocletian but became an early Christian martyr after he refused to take part in the systematic persecution of Christians ordered by the emperor. He was tortured and executed in 303 AD. The legend of St George slaying a dragon and rescuing an innocent maiden from death is medieval. As well as being England's patron saint, he is also the patron saint of Georgia and Moscow.","Ukip claim they would welcome Turkey-born foreigner St George to Britain .

"Two moving candle-lit vigils have been held to remember the 900 migrants who died when their boat capsized en route to Europe from Libya this weekend. As people lay candles by the sea in Valetta, Malta, an equally emotional memorial service was taking place in front of Rome's Verano Cemetery. The deadliest migrant tragedy on the Mediterranean so far took this year's death toll on the waters to a staggering 1,800. It came as three other people - including a tiny child - died when a rickety wooden boat ran aground on the Greek island of Rhodes. And the relentless tide of migrants escaping the war-torn country of Libya has continued since the tragic wreck this weekend. The UN said that 23,500 migrants had sailed to Italy this year in addition to 12,000 who had sailed to Greece. But an emergency meeting of EU leaders in Brussels today will announce that only 5,000 refugees who survive the perilous journey will be granted safe haven in Europe and the rest will be sent back, the Guardian has reported.

Solidarity: An equally emotional memorial service was taking place in front of Rome's Verano Cemetery (pictured) Moving: Catholic association activists prayed with candles in Rome (pictured) to remember the victims of this weekend's disaster . Italy's coast guard rescued another 220 migrants from two large rubber boats around 40 miles from the Libyan coast yesterday. Another 545 - many of whom were not even wearing shoes - were taken to the port of Salerno just south of Naples. A further 446 migrants of Egyptian, Syrian, Sudanese, Somalian and Eritrean origin arrived in Sicily after being rescued from a rickety fishing vessel. The memorial service in Malta's capital Valetta honoured the 24 bodies recovered from Sunday's disaster when the smugglers' boat capsized near Libya with hundreds trapped inside. Only 28 people were rescued and the bodies of most of the desperate migrants were never recovered. Two survivors were arrested as they stepped onto Sicilian soil - 24 hours after their boat capsized -killing around 900 people in one of the worst maritime tragedies in recent history. One was the boat's Tunisian captain was charged with multiple manslaughter and the other his Syrian crew member. Both were questioned on the long journey from Libya to Sicily last night before being taken into custody and charged with 'favouring illegal immigration'. EU leaders will decide how to deal with the migrant crisis during an emergency summit in Brussels today. But a 'confidential draft summit statement' seen by the Guardian reveals that only 5,000 resettlement places across Europe will be offered to refugees fleeing war and persecution in Africa. The rest will be sent back as 'irregular migrants' under a new rapid return programme coordinated by the EU's border agency Frontex. It also revealed that there would be no expansion to search and rescue operations around the Libyan coast despite widespread and aggressive pressure for better provisions.

Meanwhile, flowers blanket a room in Valetta's Mater Dei Hospital morgue and a touching note attached to one bouquet read: 'R.I.P. brothers and sisters. You matter.' A visibly emotional Navy Lieutenant said: 'We proceeded out at sea with the hope of course to save as many people as we could but unfortunately we didn't arrive quite in time to save the migrants. Mark Merceica added: 'We were really disappointed and you could feel this through the entire crew, we were really hoping to arrive in time.' An Italian search and rescue mission that saved the lives of over 100,000 migrants in the Mediterranean last year was shut down because EU nations refused to pay for it. It was replaced with a smaller EU scheme which focused on patrolling the coast line after some countries argued that saving migrants would encourage more to make the perilous journey. Many European politicians have acknowledged this week that last year's decision not to replace the Italian search and rescue operation was a mistake. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy, which has borne the brunt of caring for the migrants, wants other EU countries to do more to fund efforts to rescue and settle those who make it across. Many EU countries still believe search and rescue operations alone will not solve the problem and more must be done to fight traffickers. Wreck: Local men on the Greek island of Rhodes waded into the surf to save migrants on a rickety wooden boat filled with migrants that had run aground . Death: Three people died in the tragedy, among them a tiny boy (pictured) whose body was seen being carried to land on a white paddle boat . Coward: Later survivors (pictured) told Sky News their captain had simply 'run away' when he lost control of the boat . The smugglers have taken advantage of lawlessness in Libya to set up operations that exported 170,000 migrants across the sea last year. One of the proposals leaders will discuss in Brussels is a military mission to capture and destroy traffickers' boats. Italy's Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti has said: 'We know where the boats are, where the smugglers gather together the people who are fleeing.' And EU officials have drawn comparisons with operations to crack down on Somali pirates, with one senior member saying: 'We are determined to destroy their business model. The leaders will also discuss a pilot project to resettle 5,000 to 10,000 refugees from Mediterranean countries to other EU states. The United Nations estimates 36,000 have made the voyage so far this year. An unprecedented 10,000 refugees fleeing war and persecution in Africa have been rescued by Italian ships in the past week. The UN said that 23,500 migrants had sailed to Italy this year in addition to 12,000 who had sailed to Greece.","Candle-lit memorials held on beach in Malta and Rome's Verano Cemetery .

"Heavy-duty: The drill that was used by thieves during the brazen £60million Hatton Garden heist . This is the drill that was used by thieves during the £60million Hatton Garden heist over the Easter weekend. The gang used the power tool to cut through the  wall of the secured vault where they raided 72 security boxes before escaping with wheelie bins full of precious gems. The photograph of the Hilti DD350 drill was released tonight by Scotland Yard  as the officer in charge of the investigation said the crime had been carried out by an 'Ocean's 11 type team'. Police are offering a £20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the raid. The six men were captured on CCTV as they carried out the bold raid in London's diamond district. They used the drill to cut through a concrete wall into the bank's strongroom, where they ransacked security vaults. But, amazingly, the hole used by the gang was just 45cm wide and 25cm high - meaning they would have had something of a squeeze to muscle their way into the basement. Images of the scene show the mayhem that detectives discovered when they arrived at the crime scene in London's diamond district. Safety deposit boxes were strewn across the floor while power tools - including the heavy duty Hilti DD350 used to access the vaults - were discarded nearby. Scotland Yard also described how there was rubbish covering the Hatton Garden basement, while the wrought-iron cage door had been broken down. An angle grinder, concrete drills and crowbars were found amid the security boxes. Officers said there was no sign of forced entry to the outside of the building, indicating that they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside. One of the theories behind the  heist is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises. The Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company is housed in a seven-storey building, which accommodates 60 other businesses, including watch traders and diamond wholesalers. The thieves appeared to have disabled the communal lift on the second floor, before using the lift shaft - which was destroyed when police officers arrived at the scene - to climb down to the vault. Breaking in: The gang used the power tool to cut through the concrete wall of the secured vault, pictured . Caught on CCTV: Scotland Yard previously released several images of the gang as they entered the premises . Reward: Police are offering a £20k reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminal . Unaware: The men had their faces covered, but sources have suggested they were not aware of the camera . They then opened shutter doors into the basement, before boring holes into the basement wall. Appearing on the BBC's Crimewatch tonight, Detective Superintendent Craig Turner, head of the Flying Squad, said that the theft had been carried out by an 'almost Ocean's 11 type team'. Mr Turner said: 'This was a particularly ambitious burglary to say the least and has affected so many victims. 'People's property has been taken, people's pensions, people's heirlooms which obviously can't be replaced by insurance firms. 'We may well be misled - this is carried out by an almost Ocean's 11 type team, but in essence there are victims behind this and these are callous thieves.' Destruction: Dramatic pictures released yesterday show the scenes of chaos found by detectives when they arrived at the crime scene in London, where burglars had strewn safety deposit boxes across the floor . Covered in dust and debris: Left, the forced door to the vault and, right, the mess left in the corridor . Inside knowledge: The gang managed to access the security boxes without damaging the vault door, pictured . Carefully planned: Officers said there was no sign of forced entry to the building and that the thieves had disabled the communal lift on the second floor and then used the lift shaft (pictured) to climb down . Peter Kirkham, a former DCI with the Met Police who worked for the Flying Squad for five years in the mid-90s, said police photos of the scene supported his belief that the  heist was an inside job. Another former Flying Squad detective said: 'Everything you see indicates a very specialist knowledge both in what was inside the building and how to deal with it. Thursday, April 2: Workers from businesses in the building go home for long Easter weekend. Some have claimed the thieves were already hiding inside the building waiting to be locked in. Friday, April 3: Police have found no signs of forced entry at the premises, but an intruder alarm sounded at the safety deposit business in the basement at 00:21. No police car was sent. Traders have claimed a security guard attended the site but said he 'wasn't paid enough' to look inside the vaults. Saturday, April 4, Sunday April 5 and Monday, April 6: The exact time of the raid has not been confirmed, but given the amount of time it would have taken to drill through the concrete wall and opened 70 safety deposit boxes, it is thought to have taken many hours. Tuesday, April 7: At 8am, workers return to the building and finding 'scenes of chaos'. They call the police, who attend. 'There is an expertise, combined with strength, patience, determination and, probably, an inside knowledge.' Releasing the scene images yesterday, Scotland Yard said forensics had finished examining the scene and that it had taken a 'significant amount of time'. The force said the team had recorded, packaged and recovered approximately 400 exhibits, including items for DNA profiling, fingerprints and other evidence. Specialist forensic photographers have also mapped out the crime scene and utilised digital techniques to record the inside of the premises, it said. Speaking tonight, Mr Turner appealed for members of the public who may have been in the Hatton Garden area during the theft and who may have seen anything suspicious to come forward. Describing the drill that had been found at the scene as a 'specialised bit of equipment', he called for members of the criminal community who may have seen the gang in possession of it to get in touch. There are still six victims who have not been identified yet by police, Mr Turner said. 'I appeal to any of those victims who haven't been contacted by police to contact the incident room,' he added. The police previously released CCTV footage showing the suspects believed to be involved in the heist . The picture showed three suspects, using a side door to the building, as well as a van used by the gang .","Gang used power tool to cut a hole into basement of safety deposit centre .

"Hillsborough investigators have launched an appeal to track down  fans who tended to the wounded as they lay dying on the pitch at the 1989 disaster. Photographs which show the men and woman rushing towards those crushed in the tragedy have been released, with investigators urging anyone who recognises them to come forward. It comes at the request of some of the victims' families, said officials, with officers having been previously unable to identify the individuals in the images. They form part of an ongoing Home Office inquiry aiming to establish whether any individual or organisation was to blame for the disaster which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. Investigators have released these images of football fans who were pictured carrying the wounded on stretchers and tending to others at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster . Police say the 'unusual' appeal  is necessary as those photographed may be able to answer questions of the victims' families . Issued on behalf of the Coroner Sir John Goldring, the people in the photographs may be able to tell victims' families' more about how they died, officials said. Asked why it had taken more than a year to release the images, a spokesman said police had been trying to identify the people in the footage by poring over statements and other CCTV footage. 'It is important to stress that we believe these people can help the Coroner’s inquest process,' said Assistant Commissioner Jon Stoddart of Operation Resolve, the police force set up to look into the disaster. 'I know these pictures are 26 years old but if anyone does recognise the people we need to speak to then I would urge them to get in touch immediately. 'There are still many questions that the families of the 96 have and we believe that these people may be able to provide answers to some of those questions.' Ninety-six people died at the disaster after Liverpool fans in one section of the football grounds became crushed. Previous inquests which recorded conclusions of accidental death were thrown out at the High Court in 2012 after years of campaigning by the families of those killed. The Home Secretary Theresa May launched a fresh probe into the disaster the same year. While the images are not new to the investigation it is the first time they have been shared publicly. They have been released at the request of some of the victims' families with officers having previously been unable to identify the people in the footage despite taking thousands of statements. Investigators hope members of the public may recognise some of those pictured in the appeal released today . While the images are 26 years old, investigators believe they may help track down key witnesses. Above, a man in a dark coloured jacket (left) and another in a beige jacket and grey hooded sweatshirt (right) who police believe may be able to help . Another of the fans in a distinctive white and red hat and a man seen tending to one of the wounded as they lay helpless on the football pitch (right) A man in a light denim jacket with long brown hair (left) is another person investigators believe may be able to help. Right, another person pictured in the appeal who was stuck behind the enclosure where fans were crushed . Another fan pictured in the appeal. Anyone with information about those pictured is urged to contact Operation Resolve officers . While officers said it was 'unusual' to carry out such appeals as today's while legal proceedings are active they invited anyone who recognised the people photographed to make contact. One person has already been traced as a result of the appeal. 'I have a team of highly trained staff in place who will deal with witnesses sensitively as we understand how difficult some people will find this,' added Mr Stoddart. 'The Operation Resolve website also contains useful contacts should members of the public require welfare assistance. 'It is unusual to carry out an appeal of this nature during an ongoing legal process such as the inquests and for that reason I urge people to remember the warning issued by the Coroner at the start of the fresh inquests, which he reiterated in February 2014. 'I also urge people to consider the advisory notice issued by the Attorney General’s office on 10 March 2014. 'It is really important that people do not pass comment on our appeal or any other aspect of the Hillsborough disaster on social media and forums.' Among those to have already given evidence at the inquest in Warrington are the families of those killed and police officers working at the time. If identified, the people in the images released today could act as witnesses in the next phase of the inquest during which each of the 96 victims' deaths will be examined. The inquest continues. Ninety-six people were killed in the 1989 disaster (above). The conclusions of previous inquests were thrown out in 2012 with the Home Office launching a fresh probe .

"An obese mother who enjoyed takeaways and boozy nights out has lost more than seven stone after a child on a bus pointed at her and asked whether she was pregnant. Lizzi Crawford, 32, tipped the scales at 20 stone when she overheard the young bus passenger ask his mum: 'Has she got a baby in her belly?' The embarrassing remark left the mother-of-six, from Stoke-on-Trent, mortified but inspired her to ditch her unhealthy lifestyle and shed the pounds, slimming down to a healthier 12.5st. Lizzi Crawford dropped over 7st after a stranger mistook her for being pregnant . Lizzi had reached a size 24 dress after living on a diet of burgers, pizzas and kebabs. But she also devoured liquid calories in the form of wine and spirits. However Lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus. She said: 'It started when I was taking my kids to school and we were sitting on the bus. A kid then looked at me and said: ""Has she got a baby in her belly?""' Lizzi now admits that she was living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. She continued: 'It was terrible. I was being a slob to be honest. Lizzi piled on the pounds thanks to a boozy lifestyle and diet of takeaways, pizzas and kebabs . As well as her battle to lose weight Lizzi also won her battle against cervical cancer . 'I was eating burgers, takeaways, pizzas, kebabs and drinking - mainly wine and spirits mixed with Dr Pepper. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children.' In a serious bid to slim down Lizzi began cooking healthier meals and joining fitness and self-defense classes which saw her lose over 7st. Incredibly, she achieved her goal despite suffering the set-back of being diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2012. As well as winning her fight against the disease following a hysterectomy and cancer treatment she has now won her battle against the bulge. Lizzi, who works a cleaner, kept fit by attending self-defense classes at T6 Fight Club in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. She also discovered Hourglass training - a fitness programme designed to keep a woman's curves while she gets healthy. Lizzi says that having support from other women at her gym helped her to achieve her goal. Lizzi joined the gym and began hourglass training and says that she is now addicted to fitness . 'I began to build relationships with the people at the gym. The girls were egging me on to eat well - they all cheer each other on. 'I've got some of the best friends I've ever made there. They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.' The slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week. She added that losing the weight has helped her mental being as well as her physical being. 'I can do a lot more things now. I can walk more places and do more with the kids - I can even do simple tasks like getting up and down the stairs easier now. 'It's helped me mentally because it was depressing when I was heavy, but since I started Hourglass, that has just gone. 'The weight loss has helped me in the workplace too. I find I can get around much quicker and finish earlier - it used to take me ages. 'Now I can spend more time with the kids.' Lizzi's mum, Mary Crawford, 57, said her daughter's slimming efforts had been 'amazing'. She added: 'She's found out about cooking the right way, she's been going to the gym and riding bikes. 'She's stuck at it and I think it's amazing what she's done. I'm really pleased, and I believe she will keep it off as she's found a routine that suits her. 'She's like the old Lizzi I used to know as a little girl.'","Lizzi Crawford piled on the pounds after feasting on takeaways .

"Two former police officials who quit their jobs in Parma, Missouri, have revealed what they say are the real reasons they stepped down. A black woman, Tyus Byrd,  was recently elected mayor of the town over the white incumbent candidate Randall Ramsey, MailOnline reported earlier this week. Six city officials quit their jobs shortly after Byrd won, according to multiple reports. Two of those individuals - Trish Cohen, Parma's former police chief, and Rich Medley, the town's former assistant police chief - recently spoke to NBC News. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Trish Cohen, Parma's former police chief, and Rich Medley, the town's former assistant police chief,  quit their jobs with the city. Tyus Byrd, who is black, was recently elected mayor. Cohen has said she and Medley feared for their safety, and their home addresses had been shared online by Byrd's family members . Cohen alleged in the interview with the news outlet that she and Medley feared for their safety, and said their home addresses had been shared online by Byrd's family members. Referring to Byrd, Cohen told NBC News 'You can't have an anti-police mayor, and that's the way she made me feel.' 'My decision was not, did not, come lightly. At all,' Cohen also said. 'It has nothing to do with race. If it had anything to do with race, I'd done never went to work in the town.' Medley told NBC News 'From the moment [Byrd] announced her candidacy, she never approached any of us, never advised us what her plans were or anything. Never asked us to stay or told us that the moment she took office that we weren't going to have a job. 'We were in the dark on it, and then in hearing from her supporters that she was going to fire all of us, might as well start looking for something else.' Mayor: Tyus Byrd, pictured, has said she doesn't know what the 'safety issues' were and that she 'never said anything about cleaning house' Six city officials quit their jobs shortly after Byrd was elected to serve as Parma's mayor . Byrd, meanwhile, told NBC News she did not know the reason the city employees quit. She also told the news outlet she did not believe race played a role. In an interview with the media outlet, Byrd said 'It was cited to me that it was safety issues. I would love to know what those safety issues are. 'I wish we could have sat down and came to whatever the reasons were, that maybe we could have came to some type of agreement and understanding.' Speaking to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Byrd said 'I don’t understand. I never said anything about cleaning house.' The newspaper reported that while speaking to the Post-Dispatch, 'Medley acknowledged that Byrd had never threatened to fire officers, nor publicly indicated that she would interfere with police.' Medley told Daily Mail Online on Thursday, referring to the remarks Byrd earlier made to NBC News about wanting to have discussed issues together, 'She never made any attempts to talk with us during her candidacy or after winning the election. It's very hard to believe someone truly wanted to work with the police department in regards to their concerns when no effort is made. 'Add to that the information we were receiving from her supporters about firing us when she took office. It's not hard to understand that we did not believe we would have jobs after April 14th at 5p.m.' Cohen did not respond to a message seeking comment on social media Wednesday, and on Thursday her Facebook page appeared to have been taken down. Byrd did not respond to a request for comment on social media Wednesday, and did not immediately return requests on Thursday. A phone number listed for the town's city hall on its website appeared to in fact be a fax number when dialed by a reporter.","Tyus Byrd, who is black, was recently elected mayor of Parma, Missouri .

"For many of those concerned about the future of the planet, giving up meat is seen as a major way for people to reduce the impact they have on the environment. Producing beef, for example, requires large amounts of water, land for grazing and emits tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. But now Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft and philanthropist, has said it may in fact be possible to keep eating meat and still care for the planet. Scroll down for video . Bill Gates, a failed vegetarian, says the world's demand for meat can be met with 'moderation and innovation' In his most recent blog post, the world's richest man, has defended meat eating, saying was unrealistic to expect large numbers of people to become vegetarian. He also explains that some of the impacts of meat farming have been overstated. Instead he believes it will be possible to provide enough meat for the world's growing population as demand in developing countries increases. Scientists have already cooked up the first test tube beef burger, but now researchers in Israel are working on the world's first lab-grown chicken. Professor Amit Gefen, a bioengineer at Tel Aviv University, . has begun a year-long feasibility study into manufacturing . chicken in a lab, funded by a non-profit group called the Modern . Agriculture Foundation which hopes 'cultured meat' will one day . replace the raising of animals for slaughter. The foundation's co-founder Shir Friedman hopes to have . produced 'a recipe for how to culture chicken cells' by the end . of the year. The researchers say their task is more difficult than . producing the first lab-grown hamburger, a $300,000 beef patty . cooked up at Maastricht University in the Netherlands after five . years of research financed by Google co-founder Sergey . Brin. To make the beef burger muscle fibers were grown in the lab from stem cells taken from a cow. These tiny chunks were then combined to make the beef burger. Those who tasted it said it was like meat, but not 'juicy'. Professor Gefen, however, is hoping to make a whole piece of . chicken, starting from a single cell. He said: 'Although it might be possible to get people in richer countries to eat less or shift toward less-intensive meats like chicken, I don't think it's realistic to expect large numbers of people to make drastic reductions. 'Evolution turned us into omnivores. 'But there are reasons to be optimistic. For one thing, the world's appetite for meat may eventually level off. 'Consumption has plateaued and even declined a bit in many rich countries, including France, Germany, and the United States. 'I also believe that innovation will improve our ability to produce meat.' The consumption of meat has met with considerable criticism in recent years as climate change experts have warned about the harm it is doing to the planet. A recent report from Chatham House said that the global livestock industry produces more greenhouse gas emissions than cars, planes, trains and ships combined. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also found that dietary change was also necessary to 'substantially lower' emissions. Lord Stern, the economist appointed by the British government to assess the financial impacts of climate change, has also urged people to give up meat. However, calls for widespread vegetarianism have been deeply unpopular with the general public. Some researchers have also estimated that it takes several thousand litres of water to produce just one kilogram of beef due to the water needed to grow feed for them. Cattle, like those above, and other livestock produce more greenhouse gas globally than transport emissions . Bill Gates has invested some of his fortune into projects aimed at finding sustainable solutions to problems in poverty stricken areas of the world including turning sewage water into clean drinking water (shown above) This makes livestock farming increasingly difficult in areas hit by drought. Cattle grazing can also take valuable land that could be used to grow more affordable agricultural crops. Demand for meat is expected to soar over the next 30 years or so, with global beef consumption rising from 64 million tonnes in 2005 to 106 million tonnes in 2050 according to the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations. It also says pork demand will rise from 100 million tonnes to 143 million tonnes and chicken consumption will increase from 82 million tonnes to 181 million tonnes. However, Mr Gates, who set up the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with his wife to fund research into sustainable technology that can tackle poverty around the world, said some of the impacts of meat have been overstated. He points to research that suggests most of the water needed for livestock production is known as green-water, which is used to grow grass. Global demand for beef, like the steak above, is expected to soar to 181 million tonnes by 2050 but Mr Gates says that it should be possible to meet this as some of the environmental impacts of meat are overstated . Most of this green water comes from rainfall and also evaporates back into the atmosphere, meaning it is not lost. He said: 'One study that excluded green water found that it takes just 44 litres – not thousands – to produce a kilo of beef.' Mr Gates has also been funding new research projects aimed at producing meat substitutes and says he has been impressed with the results. Companies like Beyond Meat and Hampton Creek Foods have been experimenting with turning plant proteins into foods that taste and look like meat and eggs. Mr Gates also explains that he once dabbled with being vegetarian himself in his late twenties but found he couldn't keep it going. He argues that meat is an important source of nutrition needed to help children develop healthy and said it was important that people in developing countries have access to these foods. He said: 'With a little moderation and more innovation, I do believe the world can meet its need for meat.'","Billionaire Microsoft founder has defended meat eating in his latest blog .

"If you had £140,000 to splurge, would you splash out on an Aston Martin DB9 Volante or maybe even a three-bedroom detached house in Nottingham? Or, would you rather shell your hard-earned savings on a pink handbag? That is exactly what retailer Vestiaire Collective is hoping for, as they put a Hermes bag on sale for a cool £140,000 on their site. Is this Britain's most expensive handbag? A sade-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag embellished with rubies has gone on sale for £140,000 . So what do you get for your money? The made-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag comes embellished with rubies. The rare tote is so exclusive that it can't even be brought in store and experts say it's an extremely good investment. Fanny Moizant, Vestiaire Collective's Brand Communications Director and Head of UK, said: 'Hermes Birkin bags have come to symbolise the epitome of quality, the materials and the impeccable French craftsmanship are second to none. 'The brand has a strong heritage with a controlled supply, which makes it highly desirable for stylish women. This aspirational identity has developed into a strong social status symbol. The limited supply and production of rare colours and skin have made these bags must-have collectors items resulting in an increased value over time,  unlike cars, which are known to depreciate in value after leaving the showroom.' With the same amount of money that the handbag costs, you could splash out on an Aston Martin DB9 Volante . Whilst they don't own the exact same bag, Kim Kardashian, left, and Heidi Klum, right, are both the proud owners of pink Hermes Birkin bags . Hermes is one of the most coveted handbags of all time, but with a price tag of around £8,000 the Hermés Birkin bag isn't quite within every fashionista's price range (unless you're Victoria Beckham whose collection is worth a reported £1.5m). Prestigious luggage and accessories firm Hermés, who count many of the world's wealthiest women as fans, is known for luxury leather accessories. Renowned for its immaculate finish and top quality materials, Hermès claims never to use any assembly lines with one craftsperson making a single handbag at a time, hand-stitching individual pieces to create the finished product. The brand is rich in history, and some of its bestselling bags have intriguing stories behind them. The iconic Kelly bag, one of Hermes most popular styles, was originally known as the Sac à dépêches when it was developed by Hermes in 1935. In 1956, a photo of Grace Kelly, who had become the new Princess of Monaco, was pictured carrying the Sac à dépêches to hide her pregnancy. Photographs were sent all over the world and put on the cover of Life magazine. As a result, the bag became known as the Kelly and has been hugely popular ever since. Victoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian are big fans of Hermes ... handbag Victoria reportedly owns a collection worth £1.5m . The Birkin has similarly romantic roots, conceived as it was in honour of French star Jane Birkin. The Birkin was allegedly created after the company's CEO Jean Louis Dumas sat next to the actress on a Paris to London flight. Birkin had been discussing her difficulty in finding a leather weekend bag, explaining her ideal. Shortly after, in 1984, the bag she described arrived at her flat with a note from Dumas. Although nowadays the bag can be made to order, the design is still one of the most recognised in the fashion industry. And Victoria Beckham isn't the only celebrity Birkin fan. British-born author Barbara Taylor Bradford owns an impressive 24 and heiress Tamara Ecclestone has specially built cupboards to house her £100,000 collection. Katie Holmes, Julia Roberts, Hilary Duff and Kelly Brook are also fans while Jane Birkin, the inspiration behind the roomy leather must-have has said she covers her 'b***** heavy' Birkin with stickers to disguise the fact she's carrying a 'snobbish' bag.","Rare tote is so exclusive that it can't even be brought in store .

"The iconic Rosie the Riveter poster girl who became a symbol of feminist power for the millions of hard working women who worked on the home front during World War II has died. Mary Doyle Keefe, the telephone operator who inspired millions, passed away on Tuesday after a brief illness, her family said. Mary became the poster girl for American women when she shot to fame by posing for Norman Rockwell's iconic painting. Iconic: Mary Doyle Keefe, who posed for the Normal Rockwell Rosie the Riveter painting as a 19-year-old telephone operator, has died in Simsbury, Conneticut, aged 92 . Rosie the Riveter was on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post on May 29, 1943, and became a symbol for feminism and economic power for American female workers during the war. Rockwell's famous painting shows the red-haired Rosie dressed in blue work overalls sat on the stars and stripes, with a sandwich in her left hand and her right arm on top of her lunch box with the name 'Rosie' on the front. In her no-nonsense pose, Rosie shows her brute strength with her left forearm muscle bulging. She has a rivet gun resting in her lap and her feet on a copy of Adolf Hitler's manifesto 'Mein Kampf.' Although Mrs Keefe was petite, Rockwell wanted 'Rosie' to show strength, so he used artistic licence to make her arms, hands and shoulders bigger. Riveting: The painting shows Rosie in blue work overalls sitting down in front of the American flag, with a sandwich in her left hand, a rivet gun on her lap and her feet resting on a copy of Adolf Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' Same but different: Rockwell's painting is not to be confused with the equally iconic 'We Can Do It!' poster, often also referred to as Rosie The Riveter . The artists admitted he modelled her body on Michelangelo's Isaiah, which is on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Mrs Keefe, who wasn't actually a riveter, was paid $10 (equivalent to $136 today) for two sessions she posed for Rockwell and his photographer, Gene Pelham. In a 2002 interview by then retired Mrs Keefe said the artist told her: 'You sit there and he takes all these pictures. 'They called me again to come back because he wanted me in a blue shirt and asked if I could wear penny loafers.' Twenty-four years after she posed, Rockwell sent her a letter calling her the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen and apologizing for the hefty body in the painting. 'I did have to make you into a sort of a giant,' he wrote. Mrs Keefe said people in Arlington didn't make too much of a fuss about her being in the Rosie painting, aside from teasing her a little about Rosie's big arms. 'People didn't make a big deal about things back then,' she said. Rockwell's painting is not to be confused with the equally iconic 'We Can Do It!', wartime poster, often also referred to as Rosie The Riveter. Inspirational: The 'We Can Do It' poster has been copied across the world to represent feminism and gender equality, including by singer Beyonce . After selling for $5million at a Sothenby's auction in 2002, the original Rosie the Riveter is now part of the permanent collection at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. After the war, Mrs Keefe graduated from Temple University with a degree in dental hygiene, and was working as a dental hygienist in Bennington, Vermont, when she met her husband of 55 years, Robert Keefe, who died in 2003. They had four children and lived in Whitman, Massachusetts, and later in Nashua, New Hampshire. Mrs Keefe spent the last eight years in a retirement community in Simsbury, according to an obituary prepared by her family.","Mary Doyle Keefe died in Simsbury, Connecticut, aged 92 .

"Winemakers have been accused of fighting new EU regulations on revealing the calorie count on their labels because it will reveal that a bottle of red has the same as six digestives. The European Parliament is set to vote to close the current loophole, which sees all alcoholic drinks exempt from having to reveal nutritional value on their labels, next week. However, European winemakers argue that introducing nutritional labelling would lead to an intolerable rise in production costs, and hit smaller vineyards. Closing the loophole: The European Parliament is set to vote on whether alcoholic beverages must include calorie counts on their labels . Under current EU regulations, producers of alcoholic drinks are not obliged to reveal the nutritional value of their products on the label. According to The Times, winemakers  fear a fall in sales if consumers realise that 'a bottle of red wine has about the same amount of calories as half a packet of digestive biscuits'. But representatives of the European wine industry say the regulation would be devastating for smaller producers. As sugar and calorie levels varies with each vintage, this wound mean annual tests to provide accurate nutritional labelling. 'Obligatory nutritional labelling would lead to an intolerable rise in production costs,' said Aurora Abad, policy officer for the Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins, the wine industry's European body, told The Times. Fighting back: Winemakers say that introducing nutritional labelling would mean annual tests to extablish calories of each vintage, leading  to a rise in production costs that would mainly hit smaller vineyards . Ms Abad also said that as the nutritional value of a bottle of wine changes with age, the calories on the label would not be the same down the line. The European Commission was set to vote on whether to force producers of alcoholic drinks to display nutritional value on their labels in December, but the vote was delayed. Consumer and health organisations who have been pushing for a close of the loophole for alcoholic beverages say it's crucial to include calories on wine, beer and spirits so consumers can make 'informed choices'. 'At present consumers can have complete information about what is in a bottle of milk or fruit juice, but not a bottle of whisky or beer. We consider this unacceptable,' Monique Goyens, director-general of the European Consumer Organisation, said in a letter to the commission seen by the Times. This follows last year's calls from Britain's Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) that labelling is needed in order to tackle obesity. Counting calories: Consumer and health organisations want wine producers to include calories on their bottles so drinkers can make 'informed choices' RSPH chief executive Shirley Cramer said: 'Calorie labelling has been successfully introduced for a wide range of food products and there is now a clear public appetite for this information to be extended to alcohol to help individuals make informed choices. 'With two in three adults overweight or obese, and given that adults who drink get approximately 10% of their calories from alcohol, this move could make a major difference to waistlines of the nation.' A poll in November 2014 found that a majority of UK adults either did not know or underestimated the number of calories in a glass of wine and a pint of lager. Alcohol contains seven calories per gram. A large glass of white wine (250ml) contains on average 185 calories, a glass of champagne around 90 calories, a pint of lager some 180 calories while a double vodka and tonic around 145 calories.","Winemakers accused of trying to hide calorie count from consumers .
