"A resourceful firefighter has been filmed rescuing six ducklings trapped in a storm drain - using a duck quacking ringtone to lure them out of their hiding place. Cody Knecht, of St. Tammany Fire District in Louisiana, was sent out to rescue the baby mallards after residents reported seeing them fall down the drain. In the minute-long video the firefighter is seen holding a pole with his phone attached to it into the waterway as the realistic duck noise brings them to within his grasp and eventual safety. Rescue mission: Firefighter Cody Knecht, of St. Tammany Fire District in Louisiana stands in the drain holding a pole attached to his phone . During the video, the noise made by the phone is responded to with chirps from the ducklings . All six ducklings were reunited with their mother on Saturday at their home on a nearby canal . During the video, the noise made by the phone is responded to with chirps from the ducklings. As the first bird moves towards him the firefighter, also armed with a torch, dived headfirst further into the drain and emerges with the panicked baby duck cupped in his hand. The adorable animal, who is also chirping away in a noise remarkably similar to the ringtone, is then passed to another officer standing above the storm drain. It took Mr Knecht 90 minutes to catch the first four ducklings during the rescue mission in the southeast Louisiana community of Slidell. But two members of the agitated gang needed more time to calm down and were not rescued until an hour later. All six ducklings were reunited with their mother on Saturday at their home on a nearby canal. Bizarrely it was the station's second duck rescue in a week - as on April 19, firefighters rescued a duck that got stuck in a chimney. Chad Duffaut, Chief of Fire Prevention, said: 'Unable to capture the other two baby ducks, the crew went back to the fire station to give the ducks a chance to calm dawn. 'They returned about an hour later and rescued the two remaining baby ducks.'","Resourceful firefighter rescued all six ducklings using realistic ringtone .

"University of Waterloo astrophysicists have created a 3D master map of the universe spanning nearly two billion light years. The innovative spherical map of galaxy superclusters is the most complete picture of our cosmic neighbourhood to date. It will help astrophysicists understand how matter is distributed in the universe and provide key insights into dark matter – one of physics' greatest mysteries. Scroll down for video . A slice through the 3D Map of the nearby Universe. Our Milky Way galaxy is in the centre, marked by a cross. The map spans nearly two billion light years from side to side. Regions with many galaxies are shown in white or red, whereas regions with fewer galaxies are dark blue. The lighter blue and white areas on the map represent greater concentrations of galaxies. The red area is the supercluster called the Shapley Concentration, the largest collection of galaxies in the nearby universe. Unexplored areas are marked in uniform medium blue. Professor Michael Hudson, Jonathan Carrick and Stephen Turnbull, of Waterloo's Department of Physics and Astronomy, and Guilhem Lavaux of the Institute d'Astrophysique de Paris of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique of France, created the map. Published online in the peer-review journal, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society — one of the world's leading primary research journals for astronomy and astrophysics, knowing the location and motion of matter in the universe will help astrophysicists predict the universe's expansion and identify where, and how much dark matter exists. Dark matter accounts for a large majority of the mass content in the universe. It is a hypothesized form of matter particle that does not reflect or emit light and as a result it can't be seen or measured directly. The existence and properties of dark matter can only be inferred indirectly through its gravitational effects on visible matter and light. 'A better understanding of dark matter is central to understanding the formation of galaxies and the structures they live in such as galaxy clusters, superclusters and voids,' said Hudson. Scientists have observed that galaxies move more than can be accounted for by the universe's expansion. These discrepancies are called peculiar velocities. For example, our own Milky Way galaxy and its neighbour Andromeda are moving with a speed of 2 million km/hr. Previous models haven't fully accounted for this observed motion. Hudson and his team are interested in discovering what structures are responsible for the peculiar velocities. These deviations in the motion of galaxies are a valuable tool to determine the distribution of matter and dark matter on the largest scales. The next step is to get better maps and better samples of peculiar velocities to compare with our maps, the team say. They also created a video shows a 3D Map of the nearby Universe. The volume mapped is roughly circular, so it's a bit like slicing an orange vertically from the edge through to the opposite edge. The location of our Milky Way Galaxy is in the centre of the middle frame (marked SGZ=0) halfway through the movie. The map spans nearly two billion light year from side to side. Regions with many galaxies are shown in white or red, whereas regions with fewer galaxies are dark blue. It shows the density field smoothed with a Gaussian window of 4 Mpc/h.","Map spans nearly two billion light years .

"The mysterious Moai statues of Easter Island have gazed inland for hundreds of years. And now experts believe they have finally discovered how the Rapa Nui people placed distinctive 'hats' made of red stone on top of some of the figures’ heads, more than 700 years ago. They believe that the hats, or 'pukao', were rolled up ramps to reach the top of the figures which measure up to 40ft (12 metres) tall. Mystery solved? Experts believe they have finally discovered how the Rapa Nui people placed distinctive hats made of red stone on top of some of the Easter Island figures’ heads, more than 700 years ago . Despite the size of the statues, Sean Hixon an undergraduate student in archaeology and geology at the University of Oregon, believes the rolling of the bulky stones would have been relatively easy. ‘It seems like a relatively small number of people could have done it, either by levering or rolling,’ he told the 80th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. This is despite the largest pukaos measuring six-and-a-half feet (two metres) in diameter and weighing 12 tonnes (1,890 stone). Some 1,000 carved Moai line the perimeter of the 12 mile (25km) volcanic island, which is the most isolated inhabited landmass on Earth with just 6,000 residents. A tall order: Physicists believe that the pukao, or 'hats,' were rolled up ramps to reach the top of the figures (examples are pictured left and right), some of which measure up to 40 ft (12 metres) tall . Remote: Some 1,000 carved Moai line the perimeter of the 12 mile (25km) volcanic island, which is the most isolated inhabited landmass on Earth with just 6,000 residents . The Moai are monolithic human figures carved by the Rapa Nui people on Easter Island, between 1,250 and 1,500 AD. All the figures have overly-large heads and are thought to be living faces of deified ancestors. The 887 statues gaze inland across the island with an average height of 13ft (four metres). All but 53 of the Moai were carved from tuff - compressed volcanic ash - and around 100 wear red pukao of scoria. In 1979 archaeologists said the statues were designed to hold coral eyes. The figures are believed to be symbol of authority and power. They may have embodied former chiefs and were repositories of spirits or 'mana'. They are positioned so that ancient ancestors watch over the villages, while seven look out to sea to help travellers find land. But it is a mystery as to how the vast carved stones were transported into position. The island is half the size of the Isle of Wight, or twice the size of Manhattan, and lies 2,236 miles (3,600km) west of the South American mainland. Since Europeans came to Easter Island, or Rapa Nui, in the 1700s, people have wondered how the vast carved stones were erected, complete with their 'hats'. Some experts believe the stones were walked into place, while others have suggested that locals chopped down trees to roll the statues into position, unwittingly destroying the forests and causing their own demise through lack of natural resources. An estimated 100 pukao have been discovered so far, either in place on the statues, or scattered nearby. They are made from red volcanic rock called scoria and experts are divided as to what they may have been, with suggestions ranging from hairstyles to turbans and diadems. Despite this, many agree that the red colour of the stone indicates that the pukao had ritual significance. Mr Hixon’s team used basic physics to model the force and torque required to place a pukao on a Moai’s head, using different techniques. These included rolling a ‘hat’ up a ramp, building a tower, using a pulley system and putting the ‘hat’ on the statue before raising the whole statue as one. They concluded that the rounded oblong shape of the pukao means that it would have required relatively little energy to roll them up a ramp. Standing guard: An estimated 100 pukao have been discovered so far, either in place on the statues or scattered nearby. This map shows the location of the 887 statues, which gaze inland across the island, with an average height of 13ft (four metres) It may have been possible for less than 10 men to roll a ‘hat’ into place, because the oblong shape stopped it easily rolling down the ramp again, but was still a good shape for being hauled upwards. Some of the statues have indentations which may have stopped them tipping over during placement of the pukao. And a number of the ‘hats also have vertical marks and ring-shaped indentations on their side, which may indicate that strips of wood were used to provide traction up the ramp. However, while the team thinks ramps were the most likely method for the placing of the hats, their models revealed that any of the proposed methods for raising the pukao would have been possible - with enough manpower. Erosion and damage have also scarred the sides of the pukao, meaning that analysis of marks and scratches is 'far from conclusive'. It is not known exactly how the vast Easter Island statues came to line the perimeter of the small island. But in 2013, scientists claimed they may have been walked into position. A team led by Archaeologists Carl Lipo from the University of California State University Long Beach, and Terry Hunt of the University of Hawaii claimed the statues' bases were carved so they could lean forward to make them easier to transport. Walk the walk: A team of experts created a five-tonne replica of one of the statues and moved it into an upright position on a dirt path in Hawaii, to prove that the statues could have been 'walked' into place . The researchers illustrated the theory by creating a five-tonne replica of one of the statues and moving it into an upright position on a dirt path in Hawaii. With just a few ropes, a team of 18 people could rock the statue back and forth, each time inching the statue on just a little bit more. The mode of transport would have taken about two weeks. The bases would then have been flattened to stand the statues upright once they reached position. Mr Lipo said the findings may help dismantle the traditional story line of Easter Island, or Rapa Nui, that a 'crazed maniacal group destroyed their environment,' by cutting down trees to transport gigantic statues. Previous studies have suggested that a lost civilization chopped down trees on the island, laid the statues prone and rolled them into place using logs.","Rapa Nui people placed red stone 'hats' or pukao on some of the statues .

"An alopecia sufferer left with no body hair or fingernails is calling for the medical tattooing that changed her life to be made available on the NHS. Brenda Finn, 30, says losing her hair at the age of 14 destroyed her confidence. She was also left suffering crippling anxiety and depression after bullying forced her to leave school. But now, after her family paid for her to have eyebrows tattooed on, she says she is finally able to face the world with more confidence. However she says having the procedure earlier would have made a huge difference to her life. Scroll down for video . Brenda Finn, 30, became depressed after her body hair and fingernails fell out (pictured left) due to alopecia. She says having eyebrows tattooed on (pictured right) has given her the confidence to face the world again . Miss Finn is calling for medical tattooing to become available on the NHS, as she says it could have saved her years of emotional pain. She suffered from crippling anxiety and depression due to her hair loss . Crucially, she feels it would save the NHS money to make the treatment available to alopecia sufferers, who may then not require expensive counseling or ongoing treatment for anxiety and depression. She said: ‘Getting my eyebrows back has done for me overnight what psychotherapy and anti depressants could not. ‘It has made me look more ""normal"" and feel more accepted because I don’t look so different anymore. 'I had forgotten what a difference eyebrows can make to a face and only wish I had access to this treatment years earlier. It could have saved years of anguish. ‘The incredible difference it has made to me is why I think eyebrows should be available on the NHS and I hope that I can help make a difference to other sufferers.’ Miss Finn says she does not consider the treatment to be cosmetic, but reconstructive. She said: ‘I was so young when I lost my eyebrows that I hadn’t ever really drawn them on and if I did they were wonky and rubbish and made me look worse. ‘I remained very self conscious about it.’ The children’s entertainer from London was 14 when she was diagnosed with alopecia universalis. She woke up one morning to find hair on her pillow and when she scratched her eyebrow it fell out. She explained: ‘Mum thought I was playing a trick on her to get off school but when she realised I was telling the truth she panicked. After having her eyebrows tattooed on, Miss Finn even found the confidence to take part in a charity fashion show without her wig . Miss Finn was bullied at school for wearing a wig, shattering her confidence so much she left school. Working as a nursery assistant with children, who accepted her wig, built up her confidence again . ‘I could tell she thought there was something seriously wrong and rushed me straight to the doctor.’ After blood tests Miss Finn was told she had alopecia and within weeks had lost all of her hair and nails. It was then when she started wearing a wig to school that the bullying started. She explained: ‘ I was nicknamed ""cancer girl,"" despite the fact I did not have cancer. 'My wig would be torn off my head to be used as a football or flushed down the toilet.’ She endured six traumatic months before her teachers and parents agreed she should be home schooled. ‘The bullying was so bad that I had just shut down mentally,' she said. 'I wasn’t learning anything at school at all anymore because the bullying dominated everything.’ She says she became very reclusive and rarely left the house for the next three years. ‘Looking back I was likely suffering agoraphobia triggered by the alopecia - but it wasn’t ever diagnosed.’ It was only when her parents were able to purchase more expensive natural looking wigs that she started to feel confident enough to face the world again. Miss Finn had a £300 procedure to tattoo eyebrows on to her face (she is pictured before, left, and after, right). She said: ‘It was like my face changed overnight. It had structure and definition again' After securing a work placement at a local nursery, her confidence slowly grew and she one day admitted to the children that she wore a wig. She said: ‘Working with children was a great tonic for me because they are so accepting and didn’t care a jot that I was bald. 'In fact they loved playing with my wigs. It did wonders for my confidence.’ In time, she started work as a children’s entertainer and enjoyed being able to ‘hide’ behind the costumes which concealed her hair and face. Then last year her mother-in-law to be then told her about eyebrow tattooing, but Miss Finn could not afford the £300 procedure. She hoped it would be available on the NHS but when she learned it wasn't, her future-mother-in law offered to treat her. She had the tattoo in February last year and was amazed at the difference it made. Miss Finn was 14 when she was diagnosed with alopecia universalis, meaning she has lost all her body hair, (she is pictured before suffering the condition) She said: ‘It was like my face changed overnight. It had structure and definition again. I looked, dare I say it, a bit more normal again. ‘I can’t explain how good that felt. ‘I’m in a totally different place because of it and feel strongly that it should be available to all sufferers. ‘I was very fortunate to have family pay for it but others won’t be. And they may be costing the NHS more in therapy or pills to lift their mood. ‘I seriously think it needs to be addressed.’ Miss Finn, who is set to marry her fiancé Wayne next year, even found the confidence to take part in a charity fashion show without her wig, something she would never have done before her tattooed eyebrows. She said: ‘This isn’t about vanity, it’s about acceptance after a medical condition which is a crucial part of the healing process mentally and physically.’ She has now launched a petition to get the treatment on the NHS.

"Fast food giant Chipotle is making a fresh start and stepping away from using GMOs (genetically modified organisms) as ingredients. Steve Ells, the company's co-CEO and founder, discussed the new development with CNN Money. 'It's relatively easy for us to have all non-GMO ingredients,' he said in the interview. 'I mean, because we don't have many ingredients in the first place.' Scroll down for video . Fresh start: Chipotle co-CEO Steve Ells, pictured, has said 'It's relatively easy for us to have all non-GMO ingredients' Ells added 'You know, we've always paid attention to the way we've sourced food since we started 22 years ago. 'Like artificial colors, additives, preservatives. We'd just rather not be a part of that.' CNNMoney reported that the move marks Chipotle as the first GMO-free national fast food chain. Ells said in the interview that the company has 68 total ingredients and another company's burrito features upwards of 80. Rice, meat marinades, chips, salsa, and tortillas will not be made with GMOs -- with non-GMO corn, sunflower oil and rice bran oil now featuring as ingredients, CNNMoney reported. The New York Times reported that non-GMO canola oil will also be used. Simplified: Ells, seen in a Chipotle kitchen, has said the company has 68 total ingredients -- and another company's burrito features upwards of 80 . On the rise: Last year, the Chipotle's sales reportedly went up 27.8%, and its stock went up approximately 350% over a five-year period . However, CNNMoney noted GMO-feed is consumed by chickens and pigs Chipotle uses. During an interview with the financial news outlet, Ells said farmers are not currently ordered to use non-GMO feed. 'Now this is something that we would like to do eventually,' he explained. 'There just isn't enough non-GMO feed at this point.' Speaking about GMOs, Ells also said 'They say these ingredients are safe, but I think we all know we'd rather have food that doesn't contain them.' Ells addressed Chipotle's shortage of carnitas pork in stores in a separate interview with the New York Times. The shortage, the newspaper explained, is due to a pork supplier not hitting standards - meaning reduced sales. Ells told the Times 'We're working with our farmers to plan enough of these [non-GMO] crops we need to meet our supply. 'With pork, it's harder because we only need one part of the animal, the shoulder, and the farmer needs to sell the whole animal to make it work.'","Chipotle is stepping away from using GMOs (genetically modified organisms) as ingredients .

"Lucky: Selena Dicker, 38, outran the avalanche on Mount Everest in the wake of the Nepal quake . A British climber has cheated death on Everest for the second time in a year, it emerged last night. As rescuers faced a desperate race against time to airlift stranded climbers off the world's highest peak after the devastating earthquake on Saturday night, Selina Dicker described how she ran for her life as a wall of snow and ice tore through Base Camp. Miss Dicker, 38, from London, was at the same camp on April 18 last year when an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas who were climbing ahead of her group. The tragedy forced Miss Dicker, head of lending for finance company Europa Capital Mezzanine, to abandon her first attempt on the summit. Miss Dicker – who was in the same climbing party as Google executive Dan Fredinburg, who died in Saturday's avalanche – described the ordeal in a satellite phone call to her mother Gail Dicker at her home in Ranworth, Norfolk. Mrs Dicker, 61, said: 'She's a very lucky girl. I just want to see her home. Others in her group tried to out-run it and one of them was killed and two were seriously hurt.' Miss Dicker, who was born with a cleft palate, had been trying to raise £45,000 for Operation Smile, which provides surgery for children with the condition. Her mother said: 'She wanted to go back and have another go. I tried to talk her out of it as any mother would, but she is a determined and independent woman of 38 and you cannot tell them what to do. 'I am hoping her father will talk her out of it if she wants to go back again. She listens to him more than me.' Six helicopters have been flying perilous rescue missions since the earthquake triggered a 'tsunami' of ice and rock which crushed Base Camp, killing at least 18 people and injuring dozens more. Bad weather, continued aftershocks, and poor communication have scuppered subsequent trips, leaving hundreds stranded. Climber Alex Staniforth, 19, from Chester, said on Twitter that he was 'very lucky to be alive' after being evacuated to Base Camp. But while some climbers were able to tweet and update their Facebook pages, others were cut off from communications, leaving worried families in Britain desperate for news. Up to 70 Britons are unaccounted for. Traveller Samuel Beckett, 23, from Leicester, is missing and his father Martin said: 'We have not heard anything. We just keep watching the news and keep looking through the social media sites.' Among the other stories emerging from the disaster zone were: . Miss Dicker, from Fulham, southwest London,  escaped the wall of snow and rocks as it tore through the Everest base camp on Saturday morning, by running for her life and seeking shelter from a ridge . Tragedy: Miss Dicker, front left, was part of the same climbing party as Google Executive Dan Fredinburg, far top right, who died in the avalanche on Saturday . CUT OFF AND PRAYING FOR A HELICOPTER . Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain: 'All Alex keeps talking about is her need for a glass of wine. Some of us are more chilled out than others.' As the adventurous couple, both 28, spent a third night halfway up Everest, Alex's sister Liz Schneider, 23, said: 'The ordeal isn't over. They have not been able to get off yet. 'We are just keeping our fingers crossed and hoping they can get to safety soon.' Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain . Video has emerged of the moment the earthquake hit Mount Everest and triggered a massive avalanche . The Chappattes, who married two weeks ago in Chelsea, London, tweeted earlier yesterday: 'Trying to get a chopper.' They then wrote 'fog creeping up the valley'. The newlyweds have described how they saw an 'avalanche coming straight at us' and were blown over by a blast of wind. They scrambled to shelter behind other tents and had to keep making air holes in the snow to breathe as the avalanche engulfed them. DESPERATE SOS FROM MISSING TREKKER . The family of a missing British woman has received an SOS message saying her group is trapped without food and water and in desperate need of medical assistance. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Friday. One of her fellow walkers – from South Africa – managed to send a message to his mother saying the group needed help. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Frida . Susannah's sister Nina, 25, from Bath, Somerset, said: 'Someone has managed to text or something saying they are stuck in an area with 15 other trekkers. They have sent the co-ordinates but said in the message that some are injured and that they don't have any food or water and that they really need to be rescued. They have said they need a helicopter to get out. 'All the roads around them are ruined and they can't get out. We are frantically trying to work out a way of reaching her and getting her help.' THE PHONE CALLS...AND THE GRIM SILENCE . Gap-year volunteer Anna Buchanan, 18, from New Malden, was missing for more than 24 hours until she contacted her distraught mother Pauline, who said: 'As I spoke to her there was another tremor. Everyone started screaming, it was just awful.' Saad Hikmet, from Mill Hill, whose son Jonathan, 25, has not been heard of since the disaster, said: 'He was on a trek of Northern Nepal with yoga instructors and they've been going around for a month. Now we just want to know that he's safe.' Philip Green, 30, originally from St John's Wood, London, was still missing yesterday. His brother Rob said: 'Obviously we are extremely worried at the moment. It's a nightmare for us.' Barbara and Ian Nightingale, who are from Nottingham and in their 60s, were believed to be trekking in Nepal at the time of the quake. A couple from Carshalton in south London – Chloe Pincho and Brennan White – were trekking up Everest at the time of the disaster, but last night made contact. Pensioner Ann McNeil, from New Milton, Hampshire, was on an adventure holiday with her two brothers. Daughter Karen Korvin, 40, had set up an urgent appeal for information and announced last night that they had been found. She wrote online: 'I love you, Mum, please come home safely.' Leicester University has paid tribute to post-graduate medical student Marisa Eve Girawong, from New Jersey in the United States, who was killed in the tragedy. Holby City actress Catherine Russell tweeted a picture of a relative, Mike Russell, who was missing. The 42-year-old has since been found. Climbers could be seen sprinting away from the wall of snow and taking refuge in their tents at base camp . ALTITUDE SICKNESS SAVES AMANDA HOLDEN'S SISTER . Amanda Holden said her sister was trapped on the mountain and may have been saved because she had altitude sickness. The Britain's Got Talent judge said Debbie Holden had sent a text message to let her family know she had survived the avalanche. Miss Holden said of her sister, a scuba-diving instructor: 'It's awful, I can barely speak. I'm still quite numb. It's hard to take in what an awful situation it is in Nepal.' She said Debbie had not yet reached Base Camp, where the avalanche struck, because she had been ill and had stopped to recover. Amanda Holden said her sister Debbie was trapped on the mountain and may have been saved because she had altitude sickness .","Selina Dicker, 38, from Fulham, London, survived Mount Everest avalanche .

"The polls predict the Lib Dems face a bloodbath on election day, with dozens of their MPs fighting for their survival. But the metaphor became all too real for Stephen Gilbert when he was bitten by a dog while campaigning for re-election in Cornwall. He joked that the dog had 'unresolved anger issues' after posting a photograph online of his bloodstained hand. Lib Dem Stephen Gilbert posted this image online of his bloodied hand after being bitten by a dog on the campaign . Mr Gilbert is defending a majority of just 1,312 in St Austell and Newquay, and Lib Dem insiders today admitted the party is on course to lose at least 20 MPs on May 7. His run-in with the dog happened while canvassing this morning. The animal took a lump out of his right hand as he posted a leaflet through a letterbox. He posted a photo of his injury on Twitter. It showed him wiping away the blood with his handkerchief and the message: 'Am guessing this dog had unresolved anger issues.' But undeterred by the injury, and perhaps recognising that the Tories pose a bigger threat to his survival, he planned to return to the streets this afternoon. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said he was delivering a leaflets through doors at the time. He said: 'He was out in the constituency delivering a leaflet through a letter box when the dog bit him. It is a hazard of the job and all politicians are vulnerable to it. 'Stephen has been treated at the minor injuries unit at the local hospital this morning and has been bandaged up with a few painkillers. He will be back on the campaign trail this afternoon.' Mr Gilbert joked that the dog had 'unresolved anger issues' after posting a photograph online of his bloodstained hand . A quarter of MPs have admitted to being chased or bitten by a dog while out campaigning for re-election, a study showed earlier this month. Cornwall is a major battleground for the Lib Dems, with three seats coming under heavy fire from the Tories. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Hampshire where the Lib Dems held Eastleigh after Chris Huhne was jailed. But behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support. Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats. Instead of battling to win seats across the country, the party has highly targeted strategy, effectively fighting 60 by-elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance. A party source said if the party had a group of MPs numbering 'in the 30s' it could potentially hold the balance of power after May 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government. The senior Lib Dem, closely involved in the party's election strategy, said the campaign's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off. Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats . Assessing the election outcome, the source said: 'Everything is so marginal, we need to get into the 30s and the other parties need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is. 'There are now basically two possible outcomes to this election - we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the Lib Dems in it.' Asked if a seat count in the 30s was realistic, the source said: 'Oh yes.' Pressed on whether that was a 'best case' scenario, the senior Lib Dem said: 'I would like to say 150, but I think in fairness you wouldn't believe me. 'There are lots of marginal seats. There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.' Opinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support,  to barely 8 per cent . The Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats. The Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge. Mr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling.","Stephen Gilbert jokes that the dog 'unresolved anger issues' after bite .

"A Utah couple who had been married for 74 years died five hours apart. Madelyn Yensen, 94, of Salt Lake City, died just after 4pm before her husband passed away at 9.30pm. Just after her mother died, Carol Bradford went to see her 95-year-old father at a care center and told him the news. 'I leaned over and whispered in his ear, ""Mom has passed, and she's waiting for you in heaven,""' Bradford said. 'I think after that, he knew he had accomplished what he needed, and he felt that he could let go.' Shortly after her visit on April 7, Bradford's father died of heart failure. Marcus Yensen, 95 (left), and his wife Madelyn, 94 (right), died within hours of each other earlier this month after a romance that started with a month of dating and continued through 74 years of marriage . Madelyn died after suffering a seizure when she was called over to her husband's bedside and was holding his hand, according to KSL. The traumatic attack was the last time they saw each other. 'They were always together, and they were always very happy with each other,' she said. Her father always insisted her mother should die at home with proper care, Bradford said. The two married on October 17, 1940, only a month after they met when he took a dance lesson from her at a local studio. They had lived since 1949 in a quaint, brick home where they raised their three children and adopted a calico cat named Moonpie who had shown up repeatedly at their doorstep. The couple's son, Byron Yensen, said that while it was painful to lose both parents in a single day, it was comforting to know they weren't apart from each other long. The couple live in the same brick house for more than 65 years. A funeral service for them will be held at their local church (pictured) 'It would have been very difficult for Mom or Dad to live without the other,' he told the Deseret News. 'They really loved each other.' 'He didn't want to die and leave her here. He wanted to take care of her,' he added. A joint obituary for the couple said 'Being the gentlemen he always was, and showing the eternal love they had together, Marcus held the gates of heaven open so Madelyn could walk in first, then followed her'. Marcus Yensen, who had been fighting heart problems for months before his death, was a World War II Navy veteran and Union Pacific Railroad engineer, while his wife was a homemaker. The couple renewed their vows last year on their anniversary . A funeral service will be held May 9 at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Salt Lake City.","Madelyn Yensen, 94, died five hours before husband Marcus, 95 .

"She recently turned 51 but Elle Macpherson's good looks, toned body and age-defying skin would have you believe otherwise. So what's her secret? The model has revealed that she carries around a pH balance urine tester kit wherever she goes to check the state of her body. In an interview with the Evening Standard, the  model admitted that the most surprising thing in her handbag is the tester kit, which she uses to check her state of alkaline. Scroll down for video . Elle Macpherson, who turned 51 last month, has revealed that she carries around a pH balance urine tester kit wherever she goes to check the state of her body . Elle said: '(The most surprising thing in my handbag is) a pH balance urine tester kit to check that I'm in an alkaline state. I believe that most ailments come from having an acidic body.' The body's pH value tells you how acidic or alkaline your body is, and many nutritionists say that having an alkaline body helps defend against sickness and disease. An alkaline body can be achieved by eating the right foods (lots of leafy greens) and exercising. Having been labeled 'The Body' since the 1980s, Elle has had to make sure her physique is in peak condition at all times, and the Britain's Next Top Model host puts her figure down to 'variation' and 'consistency'. The body's pH value tells you how acidic or alkaline your body is, and many nutritionists say that having an alkaline body helps defend against sickness and disease. Elle is well-known for her healthy diet and even released her own superfood product, The Super Elixir . She said: 'Variation is key. I work out 45 minutes a day, six days a week, combining hiking, water skiing, swimming and running on a beach. '(My idea of a healthy diet is) consistency and eating three healthy meals a day. Having said that, red meat, wheat and dairy don't work for me.' Like fellow models Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Elle swears by the power of all things green and she is so convinced by their potency, that she's unveiled her very own brand. Last year, Elle introduced The Super Elixir by WelleCo, a range of alkalising food supplements, which she describes as her drug. She hasn't aged a day! Having been labeled 'The Body' since the 1980s, Elle, pictured, left, in 1995 and, right, in 2012,  has had to make sure her physique is in peak condition at all times . The product was formulated over many years especially for Elle by Dr Simone Laubscher PhD, a Harley Street nutritional doctor specialising in disease prevention. The powder, which can be sprinkled over salads or mixed into juices and smoothies, claims to support healthy nutrition and ensure your body is working to its optimum function. Speaking to FEMAIL at the time about the inspiration behind her new range, Elle said: 'I'm on the run a lot and if I'm not nourished, I don't feel good. 'For years, I was taking vitamins and powders. I tried alternative medicine, acupuncture, reflexology. 'I'm a pescatarian, I don't drink, do drugs or smoke so what else can I do? I wasn't unaware of wellness but something wasn't working for me and I told my doctor ""I don't feel great"". 'She told me my body was acidic, it was down to stress, travel and lack of sleep.' Elle has co-created The Super Elixir Nourishing Protein, which is made from locally sourced organic sprouted brown rice, pea protein chocolate and Peruvian cacao and a product that the supermodel credits for helping her get ready for beach holidays . So successful was the launch of the elixir that the duo have added another product to the range: The Super Elixir Nourishing Protein. Made from locally sourced organic sprouted brown rice, pea protein chocolate and Peruvian cacao, the £45 product is a plant based complete protein, containing all nine essential amino acids like those found in red meat, eggs, chicken and fish. 'Not only do I love the delicious chocolate taste but I enjoy sport and need a good source of clean protein for muscle repair, energy and of course getting ready for that beach holiday,' said Elle of the latest health product.","Elle cites the item as the most surprising thing in her handbag .

"When she appeared on the first Australian series of Big Brother in 2001, she was known as the 'lipgloss queen'. But 14 years later Jemma Gawned, 40, is the 'polar opposite' of the person she was in her teens and early twenties. The Byron Bay-based woman now runs a wildly successful raw food empire, and insists that 'spreading the vibration of love through food' is the key to her success. Scroll down for video . Jemma Gawned, who appeared on the first season of the Australian Big Brother in 2001, now runs a wildly successful raw food empire called Naked Treaties . Based in Byron Bay the Naked Treaties brand sells products out of its juice bar while supplying to hundreds of other stores . Jemma Gawned was one of the housemates on the first Australian Big Brother in 2001 (above) 'It’s interesting because I’m probably the polar opposite these days as what I was a teenager,' Ms Gawned told Daily Mail Australia. The 40-year-old runs Naked Treaties, which started off as something she was simply creating in her own kitchen to share with those around her. 'Naked Treaties started because I wanted to share this food with my friends and family,' Ms Gawned revealed. 'There was a shop next to my yoga studio and I'd just talk to them about nutrition, what I was making, and they said ""oh, can you please bring some in"",' she continued, admitting she was initially skeptical about turning it into a business. Ms Gawned had spent the previous ten years trying to get Jemma Cosmetics off the ground, but hit serious financial trouble and had to fold. What started as something to share with friends and family, quickly turned into a successful business . All the ingredients in her products are raw, vegan, organic and ethically sourced . For ten years she tried to get Jemma Cosmetics off the ground, but hit financial trouble and had to fold . '(But) then something just dawned on me one day and I thought this is just the way of spreading this vibration of love through food,' Ms Gawned said of her decision to go ahead with Naked Treaties. Now she supplies hundreds of stores in Melbourne with her raw treats, as well as running a juice bar in the heart of Byron Bay. Describing Jemma Cosmetics as an 'apprenticeship' in running a business, she said it 'taught me to trust my intuition, and trust the feminine way of doing business.' 'We’re not a profit-drive business we’re purpose driven. We really care more about our customers and staff more than our bank accounts. 'We run it like a community, like a family,' Ms Gawned revealed. The entrepreneur also opened up about her time on Australia's first series of Big Brother, how she was portrayed, and the lack of support for contestants once they leave the show. The 40-year-old says the secret to her success is 'spreading the vibration of love through food' 'We run it (Naked Treaties) like a community, like a family,' Ms Gawned revealed . The former Big Brother contestant said she never watched any footage of her on the show until last year . Jemma Gawned in the publicity shot for Big Brother for the show in 2001 . Ms Gawned revealed she never watched any footage of her on the show until last year, and is glad about it. 'What they had edited was like watching a different person', she said. 'I probably would have questioned myself, we know who we are but it’s hard enough to see yourself through other people’s lives as it is. 'But it’s even more confusing to see it through the idea of a contrived story line,' Ms Gawned added. She touched on the fact there was no follow up after the show, which according to her was designed to 'interrupt all your patterns'. 'It’s such an interesting thing you know when I think back to it… there was no ongoing support or counselling if anyone may have needed it,' Ms Gawned said. 'Not to say it wasn't an awesome experience, it was life changing.' She also touched on the lack of counselling provided to housemates after the show had finished . The smoothies at her juice bar are known in the Byron Bay area as some of the best and she has a base of loyal customers . Ms Gawned said she is glad to see a recent shift towards people living more mindful lives . One of the contestants on the show, Gordon Sloan, who used to date pop star Natalie Bassingthwate, sadly passed away in 2007 from a heroin overdose. Ms Gawned attended his funeral, and described him as a 'lover of life'. 'I think with Gordon really he was such a lover of life and he would push everything to the nth degree.' 'From what I understand he took some party drugs and they weren’t what he thought,' Ms Gawned said. These days the Byron Bay woman spends her time at the Naked Treaties store, but also in Bali and Peru where she travels to host ceremonies and source ingredients. Ms Gawned had just spent the last few weeks on the Indonesian Island with her partner Chris, a musician, running what they call 'sacred sonics'. 'Chris and I say that it’s a symbiosis of ceremony and sound,' she said. The rituals involve working with a certain type of cacao bean similar to the one used by the Mayan people on Guatemala and also incorporates song and dance.

The 40-year-old also travels to Peru to source ingredients for her Naked Treaties products . 'We honour that culture, we’re able to really access these parts of ourselves that can really shift us,' Ms Gawned said. Also working in her Naked Treaties store is former The Apprentice UK contestant Duane Bryan, who appeared on the show in 2012. 'He came here about 12 months ago and he actually came to a ceremony, he said I don’t know what just happened but I need to know more,' Ms Gawned said. A week later Mr Bryan turned up the at the Naked Treaties store, she said, and asked if he cancelled his ticket back to the UK he had booked for the next day, would she give him a job scrubbing dishes. 'I had an intuitive feeling so I said okay... He came and started washing dishes and had all these great ideas. 'The next thing he was working front of house and now he’s General Manager,' Ms Gawned said. The former Big Brother contestant, who has been on her 'spiritual path' since her early 20s, also said she believes there is a shift in consciousness and people are living more mindful lives. 'More and more of that celebrity culture seems to be shifting over more to a real experience,' she said. 'It won’t be long before everyone is awake.' She describes those who work at the store as her family .","Jemma Gawned was on Australia's first season of reality show Big Brother .

"Condemned Bali Nine drug smuggler Myuran Sukumaran has pledged to stare down the Indonesian firing squad who will drag him to a jungle clearing and kill him shortly after midnight Wednesday. That's according close supporter and artist Ben Quilty, who has taken to the airwaves in a desperate final bid to stop Sukumaran and fellow Australian inmate Andrew Chan's execution. 'Myuran always said to me he would never take this lying down,' Mr Quilty told Radio 2GB. 'That he would stare them down, that no-one would cover his eyes, that he would face it with dignity.' As a 'realistic' Mr Quilty pledged to fight the death penalty 'with everything I have for the rest of my life', the Australian duo selected the spiritual advisers who will accompany them to their execution. Scroll down for video . A grim fate awaits Myuran Sukumaran (seated left) and Andrew Chan (right), who will be led into a jungle clearing and shot by a firing squad . The execution will likely take place in 'Death Valley' - a clearing on Nusakambagan. There, they will be given the option to be blindfolded. Mr Quilty said Sukumaran will not cover his eyes . Chintu Sukumaran is pictured after visiting his brother, Myuran, on Nusakambangan at the weekend .

Lawyer Julian McMahon tearfully carries a self-portrait painted by death row prisoner Myuran Sukumaran . Fairfax Media reported Sukumaran has nominated his friend Christie Buckingham, a senior pastor at Melbourne's Bayside Church. Meanwhile, Chan has asked Salvation Army minister David Soper - a family friend - to accompany him to the clearing known as Death Valley. The Chan and Sukumaran families took a boat from Cilacap to the island of Nusakambangan on Monday morning for some of their last hours with their loved ones. They initially left the Cilicap port followed by Australia's consul-general to Bali, Majell Hind, and lawyer Julian McMahon after it was believed they were told the visitation rules had changed. The families have now received notice they will be required to make their final goodbyes on Tuesday afternoon, around 2pm local time. The Australians will be executed just after the stroke of midnight local time on Wednesday (3am AEST). Chan and Sukumaran both refused to sign their execution warrants when they were given 72 hours notice of their deaths during official proceedings on Saturday. The pair said they believed it would be unjust to kill them. Lawyer Julian McMahon carries a self-portrait painted by Australian death row prisoner Myuran Sukumaran . '72 hours just started': This painting was signed by Myuran Sukumaran shortly after he was informed he had three days to live . Paintings of a condemned man: Myuran Sukumaran's lawyer, Julian McMahon, has displayed his most recent self-portraits . Mr McMahon told Radio 3AW the pair were 'magnificently' calm when they were told of their executions. Chan has requested fresh air and to attend a church service with his family prior to the end. As for Sukumaran, he has asked for as much time to paint as possible. Mr Quilty said he was confident 'Myu' will face death with 'strength and dignity'. 'He always said to me he's made terrible mistakes. I think he's forgiven himself for the horror of what he did, the crime of what he did. Macabre scene: Coffins are readied for the bodies of the Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . The families have now received notice they will be required to make their final goodbyes to Chan and Sukumaran on Tuesday afternoon, around 2pm local time . Chan and Sukumaran both refused to sign their execution warrants when they were given 72 hours notice of their deaths during official proceedings on Saturday . 'But he has never been able to forgive himself for what he put his mum through, and his little sister, and his little brother. 'He will face it with strength and dignity. I know that about him. Because he won't want his mother to think he's a weeping mess at the end. 'He'll want his mum to think he's brave and strong and dignified. 'And she should be proud of the man he has become.' Bribery claims around the death sentences of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan must be investigated urgently as the pair await their execution within days, their lawyer is arguing. Muhammad Rifan, the lawyer who represented the Bali Nine pair when they were sentenced to death in 2006, has told Fairfax Media judges asked for more than $130,000 for a lighter sentence. Mr Rifan raised the claims months ago - without putting a sum on the bribe - and the men's current lawyer, Todung Mulya Lubis, has already lodged a complaint with the judicial commission, which appears to have stalled. Mr Lubis says the commission has an obligation to finish its probe and it's not too late to stop the firing squad, which is set for Tuesday. 'We appeal to the attorney-general, we appeal to the president in the name of due process of law, in the name of fairness and justice, not to do the executions,' he said. 'This is not an act of (a) desperado, this is a demand for justice.' Mr Lubis says claims the men face execution because of a corrupt system must be urgently investigated. 'I know that we are counting the hours,' Mr Lubis told reporters at Cilacap before visiting the Australians. 'I know that we've done everything possible under our legal systems. 'But Sukumaran and Chan still feel there's something wrong with all these legal proceedings, especially at the district court in Bali.'","Myuran Sukumaran's friend Ben Quilty says he will face his execution with 'strength and dignity'

"Decided? Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has spoken - and acted - in a way which suggests her strong supporting for legalizing same sex marriage . Ruth Bader Ginsburg has already made up her mind about gay marriage, a report has claimed, ahead of a landmark Supreme Court hearing which could legalize the practice nationwide. The famously liberal justice, who is 82, will be part of a decision which begins hearing arguments tomorrow on whether states are allowed to ban same-sex unions and refuse to recognize those made in other states. Ginsburg, who has sat on the court since 1993, has been unusually open about her opinions ahead of the cases. cutting against a long-held tradition of not speaking out in advance. The new report, Yahoo! Politics, cited interviews in which Ginsburg has referred to the American public becoming more accepting of gay rights in general - and has even officiated at same-sex ceremonies. Ahead of the first such ceremony, held in Washington, D.C.,  in August 2013, she told the Washington Post that she understood the symbolic implications of her involvement. She said the wedding, of her friend Michael M. Kaiser, president of the Kennedy Center, to economist John Roberts, would 'be one more statement that people who love each other and want to live together should be able to enjoy the blessings and the strife in the marriage relationship.' She will get the chance to make her views known in the upcoming case of Obergefell v. Hodges, for which arguments will be heard from Tuesday and a decision is expected this summer. The case is being brought by James Obergefell, an Ohio man who married his husband in Maryland but was not allowed to name himself as spouse on his husband's death certificate in his home state. Currently 37 states allow gay marriage, as well as Washington, D.C. - but Ohio is one of 13 which has held out. Protests: Pictured are gay rights protesters camped out in front of the Supreme Court this weekend. Obergefell v. Hodges will be heard from tomorrow . Votes: Ginsburg is one of four liberal-voting Supreme Court justices, though Anthony Kennedy (front row, second from right) has often sided with them on gay rights issues. Pictured above are all the Supreme Court Justices. On the front row (left to right) are Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia, John G. Roberts, Kennedy and Ginsburg. Behind them (also left to right) are Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer, Sameul Alito and Elena Kagan . The Supreme Court will determine whether the Constitution guarantees all citizens the right to same sex marriage, which could void all the remaining bans. And if it determines that recognizing gay marriage is still up to individual states, the court could also decide that states are obliged to recognize gay marriage performed elsewhere in the U.S. After a 2012 ruling, the federal government is already required to recognize gay marriage in states where they are allowed. The liberal wing's four justices are expected to vote in favor of gay marriage, and could be joined by the more conservative Anthony Kennedy, who has often sided with liberals on issues of personal freedom, which would provide the five votes necessary for a majority. In an interview with Bloomberg earlier this year, Ginsburg insisted that 'it would not take a large adjustment' for Americans to accept gay marriage across the board, and that the country has become far more accepting. Gay marriage opponents have said that Ginsburg previous actions and public statements go so far as to make her unfit to hear the case. Battle: The case was prompted by James Obergefell, left, who wants the state of Ohio to recognize him as his husband's spouse on his death certificate. He is taking on Richard Hodges, right, who leads Ohio's department of health . Couple: Obergefell, left, married his husband John Arthur in Maryland shortly before his death - but has not been allowed to name himself as Arthur's spouse on his death certificate . Both the National Organization for Marriage and the American Family Association, which oppose gay marriage, have demanded that Ginsburg remove herself from the case because she officiated over the ceremony. They made the same demand of Justice Elena Kagan, another liberal justice, who has officiated a ceremony as well. If both justices were to agree it would leave the court two liberals down and unlikely to side with the legalization. However, according to legal scholars, neither has done anything wrong because the earlier court decision had already vindicated same-sex marriages in states which had legalized them. It has been speculated that Justice Kennedy could be the swing vote in this issue. A recent report by the Associated Press speculated that his professional links with a California law school dean who hired him in the 1950s could have embedded some early sympathies. The report, citing people who knew him when he taught at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, said that being mentored by Gordon Schaber, who never married and was widely thought to gay, could swing him towards favoring gay rights. Kennedy is likely, the report said, to eventually write the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which would follow several other written opinions expanding gay rights.","Liberal champion, 82, has spoken widely about gay rights .

"David Curry (pictured) was asked to leave The Wallow Wetherspoon pub in Blyth, Northumberland because he was wearing tracksuit bottoms . A father was asked to leave a Wetherspoon pub for a family breakfast with his wife and stepdaughter because he was wearing tracksuit bottoms. David Curry, 49, had travelled ten miles from  home to visit The Wallow in Blyth, Northumberland, for the first time with wife Vee, 45, and her daughter Kayleigh. But when the family arrived Mr Curry was told he could not stay in the pub because he was wearing a pair of £40 Adidas trousers. The pub chain has apologised to Mr Curry, from Ashington, but said a no-tracksuit policy had been in place at the bar since 2013. 'I go to my local Wetherspoon pub in Ashington all the time wearing track suit bottoms and we have never been denied entry,' said Mr Curry. 'We decided to go to this one instead for a change of scene. 'We had just walked in and were just about to go to the bar when a waiter said ""excuse me you have got to leave, you are wearing track suit bottoms"". 'I couldn't believe it. I just had to laugh and walk away.' Instead, the family travelled back to Ashington and went to a nearby pub for Sunday lunch. Self-employed builder Mr Curry said he often wears sportswear as part of a health regime that saw him shed 17 stone through exercise and giving up alcohol. He had been drinking 25 pints a day and ballooned to 28 stone, but changed his ways and started running up to 20 miles a day after being told he would die if he did not lose weight. Teaching assistant Mrs Curry said the pub chain has lost money by turning the family away at the door. 'I said you are joking! We had just come for our breakfast. When Mr Curry arrived at the pub with his wife and stepdaughter he was told he could not order a drink because of his attire . 'Dave was wearing a pair of £40 trousers, they weren't cheap.

'We appreciate that the gentleman in question wasn't aware of this and we would also ask our staff to use discretion.

"Busted: Sierra Pippen, 20, is charged with public urination and public intoxication . NBA legend Scottie Pippen's 20-year-old daughter was arrested by police early on Sunday after she walked into an Iowa hotel and urinated on the lobby floor. Police were called to the Sheraton in Iowa city around 1.30am and the intoxicated Sierra Pippen was booked. Pippen was arrested at the same place on April 10 for public intoxication after getting into a fight with the hotel's security. The Iowa City police officer who apprehended her on Sunday also said that Pippen 'accused me of being racist'. Pippen was charged with public urination and public intoxication on Sunday and was released on a $500 bond at about 10am. Police found Pippen outside of the hotel on Sunday smelling of booze and showing signs of intoxication, including impaired speech and loss of balance, according to the Smoking Gun. The Sheraton is a short walk from the campus of the University of Iowa, where the undergraduate student lives in residence halls and attends classes. She was 'wearing two bar wristbands' even though she is underage, according to a criminal complaint. Pippen declined to take a field sobriety test and after her arrest she refused a Breathalyzer test, according to police. Scottie Pippen's daughter Sierra Pippen, pictured left as a child with her father, was arrested on Sunday and charged with public intoxication and public urination .

"Preservationists are battling to save a decaying asylum which achieved notoriety in the 1900s for the vast number of patients who committed suicide and were raped. Greystone Park Psychiatric Center, in New Jersey, was built to house hundreds of mentally ill patients, but it eventually was home to more than 7,500 people. It has long been abandoned and has been left to fall into disarray, now known for its crumbling walls, flaking plaster and gaping holes in ceilings and staircases which has allowed some of the rooms to be filled with leaves and snow. Scroll down for video . A decaying asylum which has been left to fall into disarray, with broken and peeling doors and windows, is being demolished as preservationists battle to save it and claim the building should be turned into a museum and housing . Many of the once well populated corridors of the building have been abandoned as rubbish is seen on the floor and walls are flaking . However, despite the state of the interior of the building and its chequered past, preservationists are arguing that it should not be bulldozed and should instead be converted into a museum and housing. Demolition work recently began on the building but preservationists are still working to save the French Renaissance-style building, and the years of history contained within its walls. American folk singer Woody Guthrie, who wrote hundreds of songs and made famous recordings of Red River Valley and This Land is Your Land, was committed in 1956 with Huntington's Disease. The genetic disorder had blighted the life of his mother and made it difficult for him to walk, causing wild fluctuations in mood. Even as Guthrie was in his final years before he died in 1967, folk revivalists were basing a new scene on Guthrie's genius in New York's Greenwich Village. One of his visitors in Greystone Park was a 19-year-old Bob Dylan. Greystone Park became one of the largest asylums, housing 7,500 patients, and became known for high numbers of rapes and suicides . Despite its long forgotten rooms and flaking examples of architecture, the future of Greystone Park has been hotly contested . Due to its extremely large size, Greystone Park was once the largest building in the US, but was surpassed by the Pentagon . The interior of the building has been left to decay so badly, with windows and roofing blown out, it would be too expensive to restore it . But campaigners claim the French Renaissance-style building contains a lot of elements of history that should be preserved not destroyed . The centre was also once used as a filming location. Greystone opened in 1876 and became known for its reputation due to the number of patients that committed suicide, were raped, and became pregnant. It was opened to relieve pressure on a nearby facility and covers around 678,000 square feet . The main building was widely said to be the largest by footprint in the U.S. until 1943, when it was surpassed by the Pentagon - which has 6.5million square feet altogether. The population of the hospital reached its peak in 1953, when millions of shell-shocked soldiers returned from the Second World War suffering from what is now widely known as post-traumatic stress disorder. Corridors have been left to crumble while some doors have been lost completely, as empty chairs are scattered throughout the rooms (right) A chair (left) shows visible signs of rust and decay, while the inside of the building has become known for its holes in the ceilings (right) The building opened in 1876 and expanded to treat more than 7,000 patients in the 120 years it was open for before closing in 2003 . By then it held 7,674 patients and was a self-sufficient campus, with facilities including a laundry, chapel, dental clinic, infirmary, classrooms, therapy buildings, dormitories and even a power station. The buildings began to decay, with plaster and paint peeling from the walls and bookshelves and door frames left warped. Patients were moved out in 1988 and the asylum closed for good in 2003 when administration staff also left. It was later photographed by Matthew Christopher, who captures abandoned buildings across America. The State of New Jersey awarded a $34 million demolition contract to tear down the 675,000-square-foot building, while other, privately-funded options were available, it was reported. The asylum once had famous visitors, with a young Bob Dylan regularly coming to visit resident patient American folk singer Woody Guthrie . It was originally built to house around 800 patients but later became home to more than 7,600 patients, reaching its peak in 1953 . The asylum closed for good in 2003 and has long been left abandoned, but campaigners want to reclaim it and use it as a museum . It was decided that the building should be demolished after the interior was deemed to have decayed so much that restoration would be too expensive. Mr Christopher said: 'While many people see state hospitals as a sort of ""house of horrors"" they are an important part of our past - architecturally, socially, and economically. 'They were built at tremendous cost to the states they were in with quite a bit of optimism and hope about the treatment of those suffering from mental illnesses. 'As these buildings vanish - and so many are gone as it is - so too does our ability to connect with our past, to understand and discuss the realities of treatment there, and to return them to positive use. 'I think they're beautiful buildings and tremendous assets, and that it is shameful and wasteful to destroy them and pretend they were never there. 'Greystone could have been saved, and it still can.' Preservationists have criticised officials for failing to consult with developers who were keen to restore and reuse the iconic building.","Greystone Park Psychiatric Center in New Jersey became known for the number of rapes and suicides taking place .

"There are growing concerns that Google's  Waze application poses a danger to police because of its ability to track their locations. The tech giant is now under pressure by top cops to turn off the traffic app's police-tracking function. The Waze app, which operates like a free GPS navigation tool, allows users to tag the locations of parked police vehicles, accidents, congestion, traffic cameras, potholes and more, so that other drivers using Waze are warned as they approach the same location. There are growing concerns that Google's Waze application poses a danger to police because of its ability to track their locations. This image taken from the  app on an iPhone, in Washington, shows police at the scene on a map on the app . Waze, which Google acquired Waze in 2013 for a reported $1.1 billion has 50million users in 200 countries, a number which is growing. Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, killed two NYPD police officers. Before the killing he was known to have used the app to monitor the movements of police . However, several police officers say the app is being used to stalk and plan attacks on law enforcement. Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, killed police officer Wenjian Liu and his partner Rafael Ramos in December while they sat in their squad car. Before the killing he was known to have used the app to monitor the movements of police officers and posted screenshots of the app on Instagram. He wrote of his admiration for Waze, according to screenshots taken by Breitbart, which he was using to track two officers in Staten Island, New York. The post was said to be made in early December. He used the same account to announce his intentions to gun down the two officers in Brooklyn, styling it as a revenge attack for the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown. It has since been deleted. Investigators do not believe he used Waze to ambush the officers, because police say Brinsley tossed his cellphone far from where he shot the officers. A Waze spokesperson said in a statement to MailOnline: 'Waze was not used in the attack on the two New York City police in Brooklyn in December, nor has it ever been used to attack law enforcement officer. 'It is not possible to “stalk” or follow a police officer by using Waze.' 'There are many ways the police feature supports officer safety and the overall goals of law enforcement. Namely, police partners have told Waze they want to be seen, often publishing 'speed trap' locations ahead of time in the US. Cop tracker: Screenshots emerged of Brinsley posting to Instagram about his use of the Waze app - on which users post updates . 'The US national Move Over law requires drivers to move one lane away from emergency or law enforcement vehicles when stopped; our alerts work to keep police safer as drivers are notified before they round a turn or pass one unexpectedly while driving highway speeds.' After typing in their destination address, users just drive with the app open on their phone to passively contribute traffic and other road data, but they can also take a more active role by sharing road reports on accidents, police traps, or any other hazards along the way, helping to give other users in the area a 'heads-up' about what's to come. In addition to the local communities of drivers using the app, Waze is also home to an active community of online map editors who ensure that the data in their areas is as up-to-date as possible . But the Los Angeles police chief insists it does endanger lives and wrote a letter to the tech company's CEO. According to the document police chief Charlie Beck sent to Google CEO Larry Page on December 30, people are using the 'unwitting' Waze community as 'their lookouts for the location of police officers.' 'I am concerned about the safety of law enforcement officers and the community, and the potential for your Waze product to be misused by those with criminal intent to endanger police officers and the community,' the letter said. Google (which acquired Waze in 2013 for a reported $1.1 billion) claims the app 'is all about contributing to the 'common good' out there on the road,' the risks far outweigh the potential benefits, reports CNN. Sheriff Mike Brown of Bedford County, Virginia, said states might pass laws to prevent people from revealing the locations of parked police cruisers. Privacy advocates, however, said First Amendment protections will stand in the way. 'Waze represents person-to person information in the public square,' said Nuala O'Connor, head of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington civil liberties group, who said she uses the software. 'And that's long been a U.S. right under the Constitution.' There are no known connections between any violent attack on police and the Waze software.","Google is being put under pressure to turn off Waze, following fears it might put officers' lives at risk .

"Binge drinking might seem like a uniquely modern phenomenon - but in fact it is a time-honoured tradition, according to health experts. Ancient civilisations such as the Romans, Greeks and Egyptians have had to deal with rowdy, drunken behaviour in public for thousands of years. Now one academic suggests that modern authorities should take a lead from their forebears as they attempt to mitigate the impact of our boozy culture. Party: This relief from Herculaneum shows Bacchus, the god of wine, with followers at a frenzied gathering . Contrast: Health experts have compared ancient nights out to modern drinking spots such as Magaluf . Mark Bellis, who is honorary professor of public health at Bangor University, is giving a talk at a conference in Las Vegas this week about the history of binge drinking. In his lecture, entitled 'Lessons from the history of nightlife - 10,000 years from Mesopotamia to Vegas', he will examine how our distant ancestors balanced freedom with responsiblity in regulating nightlife. He told the Independent: 'We think we're discovering the problems of nightlife for the first time, but these have been with us for a long time. 'There's always been a tension in history: people want a safe night out, but they also demand freedom and an element of anonymity.' Vessel: A Greek amphora which could have been used for holding the wine which was drunk in large quantities at feasts . Many of the concerns of the ancient authorities were strikingly similar to ours, according to Dr Bellis. In Pompeii - where one of the best-preserved buildings after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius is a tavern - city officials installed street lights, only to face opposition from drinkers who were worried about sacrificing their privacy. The Greeks launched wide-scale campaigns to dissuade drunkenness, with playwrights using gods in their productions to warn against alcohol abuse. And in Egypt, one of the major concerns was mixing drink and drugs, as many locals would consume a narcotic flower called 'blue lotus' while knocking back beer, Dr Bellis says. He told the Independent: 'People look for an escape from the social and behavioural constraints of the day. That's what night has always been about.' The official preview of his talk, set to take place tomorrow, reads: 'The foundations of modern nightlife go back thousands of years to when people first abandoned nomadic lives to build and live in cities. 'Since then, countless cultures have added their own innovations and regulations in attempts to balance safety and security with excitement and anonymity. 'Looking back at how nightlife developed over the past 10,000 years, we can learn from history's successes and failures and develop a greater insight into the challenges posed by nightlife today.' The use of alcohol goes back to the Stone Age, and almost all societies around the world have made some sort of drink - despite the problems that come with a booze culture. Some of the earliest written texts, from Mesopotamia, make reference to alcohol - the law code of Hammurabi, from 1750 BC, contains regulations stopping tavern landlords from ripping off their customers. The Epic of Gilgamesh shows the eponymous king promising to distribute beer and wine to his followers 'like the new year celebrations'. Many aspects of Greek culture were centred around drinking - one of Plato's best-known texts is the Symposium, set at a huge drinking party, while wine even had its own deity in the form of Dionysus. However, to avoid excess drinkers were advised to water down their wine with water, and to drink more water between each cup of alcohol. Warning: Gin Lane, by William Hogarth, graphically depicted the dark side of booze culture . The Roman love of drinking is shown by the preserved city of Pompeii, where one of the buildings buried by volcanic ash in the eruption of Vesuvius appears to have been an inn. Rowdy feasts were also part of Anglo-Saxon society, as seen in the epic poem Beowulf, which could be a cautionary tale as it features the monster Grendel carrying off warriors who were tired out from a night of carousing. The Islamic world attempted to eliminate the problem of drunkenness with a religious ban on alcohol, but there are signs that this did not always work. The 900-year-old Persian poem known as the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam opens with an appeal for 'a jug of wine, a loaf of bread' to accompany an idyllic and romantic landscape. One tactic used to tackle alcohol abuse was to substitute less strong drinks instead of spirits - for example, in the Georgian era William Hogarth published two prints contrasting the hellish 'Gin Lane' with the relaxed and peaceful 'Beer Street'.","Health expert Mark Bellis says alcohol abuse goes back as far as ancient civilisations such as the Greeks and Mesopotamians .
The Egyptians used to warn against mixing alcoholic drinks with drugs .

"A woman who tipped the scales at almost 20st has shed nearly half her body weight after she was forced to stand during an 11-hour flight - because she feared she was crushing the woman in the seat next to her. Sharon Smith, 43, from Halesowen, West Midlands, was a bulky size 26 when she went on the business trip in December 2012 and struggled to fit in the plane seat. Today she weighs in at a healthy 9st 9lb and is due to run a 10k race on Sunday, when two years she would have struggled to walk half a mile, let alone run six. Scroll down for video . Sharon Smith shed almost half her body weight after she decided to take up running . Sharon said she lost 4st through joining a slimming club but then shed another four-and-a-half stone after taking up her sporty hobby. Her weight loss began just under two years ago when she joined Weight Watchers Online, but did not weigh herself immediately. After six months of following the plan, she was 18st 6lb so estimates that when she started she was 'way over 20st' and a size 26. She said that although she had always been larger she had never been happy being overweight. Sharon said: 'I was never one of those people who was okay being big, it had always upset me but my head wasn't in the right place to do anything about it because I had a busy working life.' She put her unhealthy lifestyle down to commuting to London for her job as a children's clothes designer for Aquascutum which saw her do minimal exercise. At her heaviest Sharon was over 20st and a size 26 but she has now slimmed down to 9st 9lbs and is a size 10 . But the turning point came for Sharon after having to 'squeeze' her bulky frame into seats on trains and planes. 'I started commuting to London in August 2012 and the business trip to Hong Kong was in December that year,' she said. 'I had been travelling out there for ten years but luckily I had always managed to upgrade or have no one in the seat next to me. 'But this trip coming back I was in economy and it is the one that really sticks out in my memory. 'I remember being rammed in my seat with a lady next to me. I felt uncomfortable not just for me but for her too. Sharon says her weight was down to to commuting to London for her job as a clothes designer but after quitting her job to go freelance and work from home, Sharon was able to exercise at lunch . 'I ended up standing for the entire flight with my iPod in. 'I was genuinely worried I might hurt the woman in the next seat because of my weight. She didn't say anything but I just didn't think it fair for her to suffer because of my size. 'The flight attendant even offered me the seats they use for take-off and landing. But with the big long-haul jets there is more room to stand.' But even back in the UK, she was fed-up of the daily humiliation of her long journeys to work. She said; 'On top of this, every time I went to London I was fed up having to squeeze into train seats.' Sharon made small changes to her lifestyle, such as walking around London rather than taking the Tube, and in January 2014, she decided to quit her high-flying job and go freelance. She began working from her home which meant she could go for a walk every lunchtime. Sharon took up running last March and by now was around 13st to 14st and finding it difficult to lose any more weight. Friends were talking about the 'Couch to 5k' beginners running programme so she started doing that and signed up for a 5k Race for Life, which she did last July in an impressive 40 minutes. After getting a taste for activity Sharon joined a runners' website, The Running Bug, which 'changed her life' as she was egged on by other enthusiasts. Sharon added: 'The site, especially the members' forum, gave me so many tips and so much encouragement.' Sharon took part in a 5k Race for Life which she completed in just 40 minutes . The designer has since completed two 10k runs last year and even ran the Brighton half marathon in two hours and 59 seconds in February this year. Sharon, who is also running the Morrisons Great Birmingham 10k run this Sunday, added: 'The weight loss really picked up when I started running, it really helped with the momentum. 'Once I started training for my first 10k race last summer, the pounds really dropped off. 'I think it was a mix of things that caused the problems, I knew my diet wasn't healthy. 'At the weekends I tended to graze the whole day through so there wouldn't be that many minutes when I wasn't eating, it was constantly chocolate and crisps. 'Now I don't buy any processed foods, I don't even buy ready-made bread and I try to make everything from scratch. 'I eat a lot more fruit and veg and try to eat health fats like nuts.'","Children's clothes designer Sharon Smith, 43, weighed over 20st .

"Accused: Retired general Sir Frank Kitson (above) won a CBE for his service in the Army . A retired general is being sued over a murder in Northern Ireland more than 40 years ago. Sir Frank Kitson, who is 88, is accused in the case of Patrick Eugene Heenan, a Catholic killed by loyalists in 1973. It is the first time a retired senior officer has been personally sued over the Troubles. Yesterday however, Sir Frank said he was confused as to why he was being named because he was not even serving in Northern Ireland at the time. He learned of the legal action in a letter from a Belfast law firm at the weekend. Mr Heenan, 47, was killed when paramilitaries threw a grenade at a minibus carrying him and 14 others to a Belfast building site. His widow, Mary, is suing the Ministry of Defence and the general, claiming he died because of ‘negligence and misfeasance’. But Sir Frank told the Daily Mail he had no connection to the case. ‘I wasn’t even there in 1973,’ he said. ‘I was in Ireland from September 1970 until April 1972. I know nothing about what happened to Mr Heenan. 'I wasn’t a policy maker, I was a commander of troops. I have absolutely no knowledge of Mr Heenan and I had gone from Ireland at the time of his death.’ Baffled: Sir Frank (pictured), who is now 88, said he was confused as to why he was being named because he was not even serving in Northern Ireland at the time of the murder in 1973 . Sir Frank also denied the claim that he was in charge of military operations in Northern Ireland during the early 1970s: ‘I was not. ‘I was commanding one of three brigades. Above me there was a major general and a lieutenant general. ‘We were working very closely with the police at the time, we have to make our plans together. We never instigated the use of paramilitary gangs.’ Colonel Tim Collins – formerly of the 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment – described the decision to pursue General Kitson as strange. He added: ‘Not only is it a strange case, it worries me that such an action is allowed by the authorities and the Government. ‘What is also of concern is that there are people out there who are set to profit by taking cases such as these.’ Kevin Winters, of law firm KRW, said: ‘This week we have issued proceedings against the MoD and Frank Kitson on behalf of our clients, the relatives of Patrick Heenan. 'These are civil proceedings for damages but their core value is to obtain truth and accountability for our clients as to the role of the British Army and Frank Kitson in the counter-insurgency operation in the north of Ireland during the early part of the conflict.’ Royal appointment: Sir Frank (far right) is pictured with the Queen, Major General Patrick Palmer (centre), and Lieutenant General Sir Edward Burgess (left) during a visit to York in May 1983 . He claimed loyalist paramilitary gangs were ‘core to the Kitson military doctrine endorsed by the British Army and the British government at the time’. Eugene Heenan, son of the murdered man, said he and his 88-year-old mother would travel to London on Thursday to generate publicity for the civil action. He added: ‘Kitson may not have been in Ireland when my father was murdered but those who did were working to a template he had developed while in various countries and it is him who has to be held accountable.’ Sir Frank has been named co-defendant in the legal action on grounds that he and others used agents when they knew, or should have known, that they would take part in criminal actions. He was awarded a CBE in February 1972 for ‘gallant and distinguished’ services in Northern Ireland from August 1971 to November 1971. He enjoyed a distinguished career, serving in Oman and Malaya and in Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion, for which he received the Military Cross in 1955. The general rose to become commander-in-chief UK land forces from 1982 to 1985. Former soldier Albert ‘Ginger’ Baker received a life sentence for killing Mr Heenan and three others but he later claimed to have links to British intelligence. He was a member of the outlawed Ulster Defence Association and known to be a leading member of the so-called ‘Romper Room’ gang. Although no inquest was held into Mr Heenan’s death, it has been claimed he could have survived had first aid been given quickly.","Sir Frank Kitson, 88, accused in 1973 case of Patrick Eugene Heenan, 47 .

"A photo editor for a Baltimore newspaper says he was beaten by police at a protest over the death of Freddie Gray. J.M. Giordano, who works at the City Paper, says Baltimore police 'swarmed over' him and hit him repeatedly. A video posted to the newspaper's website Sunday shows at least two police officers in riot gear hitting and kicking Giordano as City Paper Managing Editor Baynard Woods screams, 'He's a photographer! He's press!' Scroll down for video . Injured on the job: A photojournalist was allegedly beaten by police Saturday night as he covered protests in Baltimore, Maryland . Shoved to the ground: Giordano says he was standing in front of a police line when they suddenly started marching and he couldn't get out of the way fast enough. Pictured above in a photo posted to Facebook . The 41-year-old photographer says the incident happened around 12.30am when someone threw a rock at a police line and hit an officer's shield. Giordano and a protester were standing next to each other when the police line suddenly marched forward and the two men didn't move out of the way quickly enough, each being knocked to the ground. About five or six police officers hit Giordano and the other protester with their shields, the photographer said. 'They just swarmed over me,' he said, according to City Paper. 'I got hit. My head hit the ground. They were hitting me, then someone pulled me out.' 'I kept shooting it. As soon as I got up I started taking pictures.' After the incident, the protester who was standing next to Giordano was arrested - even though the photographer was sure that he wasn't responsible for throwing a projectile at police, which sparked the charge by officers. That protester was just one of nearly 35 arrested in the protests Saturday night and Sunday morning. The march turned violent later in the evening, when groups of rogue protesters started vandalizing local businesses and smashing cars. Giordano believes he was let go because police knew he was a member of the press, but says they tried to block him from continuing to photograph the event. Hitting a journalist: In the video, the City Paper managing editor can be heard yelling 'He's a photographer! He's press!' to no avail . Released: The protester who was knocked down to the ground with Giordano was arrested. Giordano believes he was left alone because police knew he was a member of the media . Blocking: However, Giordano says police continued to try to block him from photographing the protest after the incident . Minor: Giordano says he sustained minor injuries to his arm. However, he says that they will not keep him out of work . On the ground: Above, a photo Giordano took Saturday night after being pushed to the ground by police . However, Giordano says another photographer working at the protest was arrested - Sait Serkan Gurbuz with Reuters who was later released and cited for disorderly conduct. Police did not immediately comment on the incident involving Giordano or Gurbuz's arrest. Giordano says he suffered minor injuries to his arm but that they will not stop him from continuing to photograph the Gray protests. In addition to his work at City Paper, Giordano has had his photos published by i-D magazine, the Baltimore Sun, and Al-Jazeera America. Baltimore has been in a state of unrest ever since April 19, when a local man named Freddie Gray died from injuries allegedly sustained while in police custody. The protests on Saturday night were in his honor. On Sunday, friends and family gathered to remember Gray at his wake. The next generation: Before the protests escalated on Saturday, fellow photographer Matt Roth took this touching photo of Giordano teaching some local kids how to use his professional camera .","Photographer J.M.

"The orchid is one of the most unique and instantly recognisable flowers in the world. It has evolved a so-called lip - a large and irregular modified petal, to attract insects - but the driving force behind this unusual shape was not known, until now. Researchers have found that its shape is determined by two competing groups of proteins and by tweaking them, they can convert this lip into a standard petal. The orchid (an example of which is pictured) has evolved a so-called lip - a large and irregular modified petal, to attract insects - but the driving force behind this unusual shape was not known, until now . The study, published in the journal Nature Plants, extends scientists' understanding of the mechanisms leading to the diverse beauty of orchid flowers. There are between 21,950 and 26,049 accepted species of Orchid, most of which have a large and irregular modified petal, called the lip, in addition to three 'normal' petals. The structure of orchids is unique among floral plants. They also have three sepals, which sometimes look like other petals, and a single column at the centre which is used during reproduction. Researchers have found its shape is determined by two competing groups of proteins. They converted lips into petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the L complex using gene silencing (illustrated) Conversion of lips into sepal/petal-like structures in Oncidium and Phalaenopsis orchids is shown . Orchids have three sepals, which sometimes look like other petals, and a single column at the centre. Lips attract insect pollinators and serve as a landing platform for them, which is thought to have given orchids an evolutionary advantage over other flowers, by promoting reproduction. To discover why the flowers developed their distinctive lips, researchers  from National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan studied the expression of a class of genes known to be associated with petal development. They found that in mature orchid flowers, the expression pattern suggests two protein complexes, called the 'L' complex and the 'SP' complex, compete to promote the formation of the lip and standard petals. The have called this mechanism the Perianth code and discovered that orchid species from many subfamilies with different types of lips and petals all obey it. The experts were also able to convert lips into petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the L complex using gene silencing. Lips attract insect pollinators and serve as a landing platform for them, which is thought to have given orchids an evolutionary advantage over other flowers, by promoting reproduction. Lips are differently coloured, ruffled or pouch-shaped, depending on the species, and can be decorated with horns, hairs, warts, teeth and tails to attract specific pollinators. These range from bees to flies, gnats, moths, butterflies, hummingbirds and even bats in some tropical climates. To discover why the flowers developed their distinctive lips, Chang-Hsien Yang and his colleagues from National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan studied the expression of a class of genes known to be associated with petal development. They found that in mature orchid flowers, the expression pattern suggests two protein complexes, called the 'L' complex and the 'SP' complex, compete to promote the formation of the lip and standard petals.

The scientists studied the expression of a class of genes known to be associated with petal development. They found that in mature orchid flowers,  two protein complexes, called the 'L' complex (red) and the 'SP' complex (blue), compete to form the lip and petals. This competition and balancing act is illustrated above . The pastel-coloured orchid mantis has fascinated naturalists for more than a century. It was popularly thought that the insect, whose legs are flattened and heart-shaped to resemble petals, simply mimics an orchid, allowing it to 'hide' and catch prey. But earlier this year, scientists suggested that the mantis doesn't simply blend into flowers, but is attractive to insects in its own right, sometimes preferring to remain more easily visible on leaves. It was popularly thought that the orchid mantis (pictured), whose legs are flattened and heart-shaped to resemble petals, simply mimics an orchid, allowing it to 'hide' and catch prey . Dr James O'Hanlon of Macquarie University, Australia, set about systematically testing the ideas contained within the traditional view of the orchid mantis' modus operandi. First, his team tested whether mantises actually camouflage among flowers, or, alternatively, attract insects on their own. For a flower-seeking insect, as predicted, the mantis' colour pattern is indistinguishable from most common flowers. However, when paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat, insects approached mantises more often than flowers, showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves, rather than simply camouflaging among the flora. 'We can clearly observe insects, like bees, diverging from their flight paths and flying right towards this deceptive predator,' Dr O'Hanlon said. When paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat, insects approached mantises more often than flowers, showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves, rather than simply camouflaging among the flora. Here, an orchid mantis eats a Tiger heliconian butterfly in Malaysia . They also found that mantises did not choose to hide among the flowers, but selected leaves to sit on, just as often. Sitting near flowers did bring benefits, though, because insects were attracted to the general vicinity. When they compared the mantis's shape and colour with flowers from an insect's perspective, the predator did not resemble an orchid or indeed any particular species of flower, but rather a 'generalised' flower. They may exploit a loophole created by evolutionary efficiency savings within the insect brain. The compact brains of insects use a rule of thumb - anything matching colour X is a nectar-containing flower – and the predator uses 'sensory exploitation' to catch its victims. Sensory exploitation is a concentrated mass of the right colour. The insect classifies the mantis as a giant nectar-filled flower and approaches to investigate – to its doom.","Orchid has evolved a 'lip' - irregular modified petal - to attract insects .

"By 2030 up to 170 million hectares (420 million acres) of forest - equivalent to the combined size of Germany, France, Spain and Portugal - could be lost, conservationists have warned. The huge amount of global deforestation is expected to occur in less than a dozen global hostpots, based on current trends. Research by wildlife charity the WWF identified 11 'deforestation fronts' where 80 per cent of projected global forest losses by 2030 could occur. By 2030 up to 170 million hectares (420 million acres) of forest - equivalent to the combined size of Germany, France, Spain and Portugal - could be lost in just 11 hotspots, including the Amazon (shown) and eastern Australia, conservationists have warned . The areas are the Amazon, the Atlantic Forest and Gran Chaco, and the Cerrado in South America, the Choco-Darien in Central America, the Congo Basin, East Africa, eastern Australia, the Greater Mekong in South East Asia, Borneo, New Guinea and Sumatra. The fronts, which are at sustained and increased risk of deforestation, are home to indigenous communities that depend them for their livelihoods and endangered species such as orangutans and tigers, the WWF said. The Amazon . The Atlantic Forest and Gran Chaco . The Cerrado . The Choco-Darien . The Congo Basin . East Africa . Eastern Australia . The Greater Mekong . Borneo . New Guinea . Sumatra . But they are being lost to expanding agriculture, including livestock farming, palm oil plantations and soy production, as well as small-scale farmers, the WWF's latest Living Forests report warned. Unsustainable logging and wood fuel collection is also causing forest degradation - while mining, construction of hydroelectric dams and other projects cause roads to be built that open new areas of forest to settlers and agriculture, the WWF warned. The conservation group is calling for action including expanding and strengthening protected areas, recognising the benefits forests provide and boosting schemes which provide incentives to countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation. WWF-UK is campaigning to close European Union loopholes which mean that products such as furniture, books or cards can be sold which have been made from illegally or unsustainably sourced wood. The fronts, which are at sustained and increased risk of deforestation, are home to indigenous communities that depend them for their livelihoods and endangered species such as orangutans and tigers, the WWF said. 80 per cent of projected losses will occur in just these 11 areas . Rod Taylor, director of the WWF's global forest programme, said: 'Imagine a forest stretching across Germany, France, Spain and Portugal wiped out in just 20 years. 'We must tackle that risk to save the communities and cultures that depend on forests, and ensure forests continue to store carbon, filter our water, supply wood and provide habitat for millions of species.' WWF analysis shows that more than 230 million hectares (570 million acres) of forest could vanish by 2050 if no action is taken, with the organisation warning that forest loss must be reduced to near zero by 2020 to avoid dangerous climate change and economic losses. They are being lost to expanding agriculture (example of a rainforest cleared in the Amazon shown), including livestock farming, palm oil plantations and soy production, as well as small-scale farmers, the WWF's latest Living Forests report warned . Unsustainable logging and wood fuel collection (shown in Australia) is also causing forest degradation - while mining, construction of hydroelectric dams and other projects cause roads to be built that open new areas of forest to settlers and agriculture, said the WWF . WWF-UK's chief adviser of forests, Will Ashley-Cantello, said: 'Deforestation needs to stop if we are to reverse biodiversity loss and combat climate change - which, if unchecked, will affect our quality of life. 'Managing forests sustainably could underpin sustainable development, poverty alleviation and a stable climate around the world.' He added: 'Here in the UK you can still buy furniture, books, cards and other products made from illegally or unsustainably sourced wood. EU rules to prevent the exploitation of forests only cover half of traded products. 'The next UK government should lobby hard to end this nonsense.' Thousands of square miles of rainforest is cleared in the Amazon each year to make way for farming land - a pattern of destruction that takes place all around the world. But despite this, the planet has got greener in the past decade, with the total amount of plant coverage increasing overall, according to one study. The increase is so noticeable that the world's trees and plants now store almost four billion more tonnes of carbon than they did in 2003. This is thanks to tree-planting in China, forest regrowth in former Soviet states because of abandoned farms, and more lush savannas because of higher rainfall. Scientists analysed 20 years of satellite data and found an increase in carbon, despite ongoing large-scale tropical deforestation in Brazil and Indonesia, according to research published in Nature Climate Change.","Up to 420 million acres of forest will be lost in the next two decades .

"Poppy Smart complained to police after accusing builders of sexual harassment for wolf-whistling . When Poppy Smart was wolf-whistled at by builders on her walk to work, she at first tried to ignore it. But as the whistles and accompanying sexist comments turned into a daily ritual, the 23-year-old began to get upset. Finally, after a month of unwanted attention from the men on the building site, the marketing co-ordinator decided she'd had enough – and called the police. Miss Smart, who recorded the constant whistling using her smartphone's video function, also contacted one of the construction companies working at the site to complain of sexual harassment. She compared the wolf-whistling to racial discrimination and said it made her walk to work in Worcester city centre an 'awful experience'. One of the workers even approached her on the pavement, blocking her way, before saying 'Morning love' after she had ignored a cacophony of whistling, Miss Smart said. 'He was probably 18 or 19 and got right in my face, standing next to an older man. He didn't touch me but they were in my personal space in the pavement, in my way, even though I literally blanked him. It is incredibly intimidating. I'm quite a nervous person and this has made my anxiety worse. 'The whistling went on for a month. I eventually contacted the building company and the police on the same day when it got so bad. I even considered changing my route to work but thought, 'Why should I do that?' West Mercia police confirmed they had followed up Miss Smart's complaint as a possible incident of anti-social behaviour but had not taken further action. A spokesman said: 'After consultation with the woman who reported the behaviour it was decided that the employers would deal with those said to be responsible.' Although wolf-whistling is not a specific offence, workmen who repeatedly make obscene comments to passers-by could be convicted of a breach of the peace. Miss Smart, from Worcester, was first whistled at in the middle of February when she started a new job. Ms Smart recorded one of the occasions she walked past the building site. There is no suggestion any of the men pictured in the mobile phone footage (shown left and right) were involved in the alleged wolf-whistling . The builders concerned were working on the expansion of the Bolero restaurant. Miss Smart said she had not seen the men responsible since she complained to the building company, Fimeca. The firm's boss was 'shocked and annoyed' at his staff's behaviour and asked her to contact him if there was a repeat, she said. Fimeca Building and Maintenance, of Pershore, Worcestershire, said the matter was being dealt with by the firm's solicitors but refused to comment further. Miss Smart said she had been targeted on other occasions in Worcester, not just near the building site.

'Disrespectful': The 23-year-old marketing co-ordinator (pictured) claimed builders at a construction site wolf-whistled at her every morning as she walked to work in Worcester city centre . 'Men will lean out of their cars or vans and shout comments about my appearance or whistle and I have seen this happen to others as well. I don't think such comments, even if they are considered complimentary by the perpetrators, are appropriate. It makes walking through town an awful experience.' In 2012, David Cameron insisted wolf-whistling would not be made illegal in Britain despite signing the UK up to the Council of Europe's convention on violence against women, which pledges to outlaw 'verbal, non-verbal or physical' sexual harassment. At the time, Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'We have harassment laws in this country. We are not proposing to criminalise wolf-whistling.' Sarah Green, of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said wolf-whistling represented 'everyday sexism' which should be stamped out. 'Sexual harassment in the street is too often regarded as trivial when the reality is that many women feel humiliated, insulted and sometimes intimidated by it,' she said. 'Men who respect women do not do it.' Wolf-whistles, which originated among sailors, have now been banned by a number of building firms.

"From the lack of sleep to breastfeeding, becoming a mother for the first time is no mean feat. One new mother decided to start a blog called Upfront Mama detailing the trials and tribulations of raising her little girl Poppy, 14 months, who, she says, is the best and most life changing thing that has ever happened to her. Like so many new mothers, Nicola Bonn, 34, from London was learning on the job and found the whole experience 'exciting yet utterly petrifying'. Scroll down for video . Nicola Bonn, 34, from London, started a candid blog called Upfront Mama detailing the trials and tribulations of raising her little girl Poppy, 14 months, and many of her posts have gone viral . She wanted to share all the things that she had learnt so that fellow mothers wouldn’t feel as 'clueless' as she did. One of her blog posts, Why We Need to Stop Justifying Ourselves, went viral - no doubt thanks to her candid account of bringing up a baby for the first time. Here, she shares it with FEMAIL... 'Since becoming a mama I’ve spent way too much time explaining myself and almost apologising for my decisions and I’ve decided that it has to stop. 'The problem is that when you have a baby, everyone has an opinion and they’re often not afraid to air it which can be quite overwhelming for a new mother who is less experienced than the 'advice giver' and is most probably filled with high levels of self doubt. Nicola, 34, wanted to share all the things that she had learnt so that fellow mothers wouldn’t feel as 'clueless' as she did, and admits that since becoming a mother, she's spent way too much time explaining herself and almost apologising for her decisions - and she's decided that it has to stop . She believes one of the main hurdles is that everyone has an opinion and they're often not afraid to air it, which. she says, can be quite overwhelming for a new mother who is less experienced . 'Over the past year, countless people have questioned decisions that I have made. They always do it in this seemingly innocent but quite obviously judgemental way that is hair-pullingly irritating and invariably follow it with a comment about what they might do better. 'Off the top of my head, here are some examples: . 1. You’re still feeding Poppy milk when she wakes up during the night? Oh I wouldn’t do that..she’s far too old. 2. You rock her to sleep? Do you not think she should be self settling at this age? 3. You encourage her to play with her food? Isn’t that encouraging bad manners? 4. You don’t breast feed? You do know that it really is best for bonding? 5. You take her on the underground? It’s full of germs. Why do you do that? 'Instead of doing what I should and saying 'yes I do' in a firm but polite way and ending the conversation there, I always go into great detail about why I do these things. 'No, I don’t breast feed because I find it really tough. I tried but I couldn’t do it and it was actually affecting the bonding process. I do express though…lots and it’s  exhausting but I do it because I’m trying to do my best. Nicola often finds other mothers saying to her: 'You encourage her to play with her food? Isn't that encouraging bad manners?' but says she has to believe in the choices that she makes on a daily basis because if she starts doubting herself then it won't do anyone any good…least of all Poppy . 'Yes, I sometimes rock her to sleep because she loves it and it helps her to settle. I know it’s probably not advisable at her age but it means that she goes to sleep faster and I’m knackered and I need a break and a glass of wine ASAP! 'Yes, I take her on the underground. I can’t drive and that’s how we get around and she loves it. It’s not as if she’s actually licking the floor…well even if she does it can’t be as bad as the toddler who licked the loo brush in Mc Donalds and he didn’t die did he? 'Why do I do this? Why can’t I just believe in my instinct and decisions? None of them have been taken lightly, there is a reason for all of them and as a mother, I have to believe in the choices that I make on a daily basis because if I start doubting myself then it won’t do anyone any good…least of all Poppy. Nicola says that the next time women feel judged for a decision that they have made concerning their child, they shouldn't explain themselves because, after all, they know their child better than anyone else does . 'I’m the first person to ask for advice when I need it and I often do. 'In fact, I think that one of the most beautiful things about motherhood is women passing on wisdom that they have learnt from generation to generation. It creates a magical bond amongst us that makes you proud to be a female and more importantly a mother. But, there is a difference between kindly passing on wisdom and questioning and judging fellow mamas. 'So, next time we feel judged for a decision that we have made concerning our child, let’s not explain ourselves. 'Instead, let’s believe in what we are doing and keep doing it. We know our children better than anyone else does and we are their mothers and that counts for everything!'.","Nicola Bonn, a journalist and broadcaster, shares her candid account .

"The second in command at the sheriff's department where reserve deputy accidentally killed a man because he fired his gun instead of a Taser has resigned. Undersheriff Tim Albin, of the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office in Oklahoma, quit his job Monday after new revelations about how the department treated elderly killer Robert Bates, 73. Bates, who was a volunteer deputy, shot dead Eric Harris, 44, after he was tackled to the ground. Video of the killing shows Bates exclaiming that he opened fired by accident, and apologizing. Resignation: Undersheriff Tim Albin (pictured), of the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office in Oklahoma, quit his job Monday after new revelations about how the department treated elderly killer, reserve deputy Robert Bates . In the tide of scrutiny which followed the incident, it emerged that other deputies in the department had expressed concern about his fitness to serve, but were told to hold their tongues. Bates, a millionaire insurance broker, had made substantial donations to the department in previous years. He has been charged with manslaughter - but a judge allowed him to take a month-long holiday to the Bahamas before his day in court. Sheriff Stanley Glanz didn't specify why Undersheriff Tim Albin stepped down, but said departmental reorganization was necessary following the April 2 shooting. Charged: Bates, 73, (left) accidentally grabbed his pistol and killed Eric Harris (right, in a previous mug shot) in what he said was an accident . 'Given the gravity of the current situation and the need to go a different direction with our leadership and management he agrees with me that it is time for a change,' Glanz wrote in a news release. Albin, who has been in his position for 26 years, has yet to comment on his departure, which will take effect and the end of this week. Albin was named in a 2009 internal investigation released Friday that showed deputies had expressed concerns about Bates' performance. Some claimed Albin gave Bates preferential treatment and intimidated those who raised concerns. The former head of the reserve deputy program, Sergeant Randy Chapman, told the investigator that Albin chastised him after he questioned Bates' performance. Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . 'You need to stop messing with (Bates) because he does a lot of good for the County,' Chapman is quoted in the memo saying Albin told him that. Chapman declined to talk about the memo when contacted last week by The Associated Press and also declined Monday after Albin's resignation. 'I've been told to stay out of it,' he said. According to the report, Chapman complained to Albin on one occasion that Bates was driving a personal car with police equipment prior to having the requisite training, Albin told him: 'This is a s--- sandwich and you will just have to eat it but not acquire a taste for it.' A little more than five years later, 44-year-old Eric Harris was shot while on the ground in custody after running from deputies following a sting operation. The 73-year-old Bates has pleaded not guilty to a charge of second-degree manslaughter. Bates is white and Harris was black, but the victim's brother has said he doesn't believe the shooting was racially motivated. Attorneys for Harris' family have repeatedly called on Glanz and Albin to resign.","Tim Albin of the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office quit his job on Monday .

"Thailand has seized three tons of ivory hidden in tea leaf sacks from Kenya in the second-biggest bust in the country's history, customs officials said today. The 511 elephant tusks, worth $6million (£4m), which were bound for Laos, were seized upon arrival Saturday at a major port in Chonburi province in eastern Thailand. The bust came after customs officials received a tip-off in Laos and Thailand and tracked the containers from Kenya, Customs Department Director-General Somchai Sujjapongse revealed. Scroll down for video . Thai customs officers inspect more than 500 elephant tusks at the Customs Bureau in Bangkok after they were found hidden in stacks of tea leaves on a ship from Kenya . The 511 elephant tusks worth $6million (£4m), bound for Laos, were seized upon arrival on Saturday at a major port in Chonburi province in eastern Thailand . The ivory, hidden among tea leaves, was shipped out of Kenya on March 24 and went through ports in Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Singapore before coming to Thailand, he said. The bust came one week after Thai customs officials seized four tons of tusks that were smuggled from Congo and also destined for Laos in what they said was the nation's biggest ever seizure. Somchai said the tusks seized on Saturday were 'more beautiful and complete than the previous lot' and that they would likely have been distributed to buyers in China, Vietnam and Thailand had the shipment reached Laos.

"Jeremy Clarkson and his fellow Top Gear presenters were just about to renew their lucrative contacts for three more years but they were scrapped when the star punched the show's producer. James May, 52, revealed he had prematurely celebrated the three-year deal by ordering a rare  £200,000 Ferrari before Clarkson's sacking after an infamous 'fracas' with producer Oisin Tymon. May says he had ordered the last ever Ferrari 458 Speciale - in bright orange - while the 'draft version' of the lucrative contract was sitting on his desk 'with only a few details to resolve'. But after Clarkson punched Tymon in a rage over a hot meal, the offer was taken off the table. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson (right) and his Top Gear colleagues had been on the brink of a lucrative new contract when Clarkson's infamous 'fracas' led to the offer being taken away . May revealed that he had prematurely celebrated the three-year deal while the contract was still being finalised by ordering a £200,000 Ferrari 458 Speciale in bright orange (pictured) The presenter said the trio had planned to continue making the show until the end of the new contract before leaving 'with dignity'. But Clarkson, 55, was sensationally sacked by the BBC last month and Richard Hammond, 45, joined May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear this week. Writing in a column for the Sunday Times, May said: 'There we were, all three of us, on the brink of a new three-year contract to make Top Gear, after which we would definitely chuck it in with dignity and hand the reins to a new generation, assuming we were still alive . 'There were a few details to resolve about time frames and other mundane stuff, but the groaning draft version of this document was actually sitting on my desk. 'This was a great privilege and a once-in-a-lifetime event; an invitation to continue presenting the world's biggest TV show for – let's not be shy – a handsome salary.' The three men had planned to stay on for another three years before quitting 'with dignity' until Clarkson was sensationally sacked after punching show producer Oisin Tymon (pictured) On the future, he remained vague, suggested the three may be reunited on screen or go in separate directions. Now, May admits ordering a brand new Ferrari is a 'strange' thing for an unemployed person to do, but insists he has no regrets, describing the purchase as a once-in-lifetime opportunity. He acknowledged the supercar was an extravagant purchase at £208,090 but that 'it was better than money in the bank'. Meanwhile, Clarkson was seen talking himself out of a parking ticket for his bright green Lamborghini yesterday after leaving it parked on yellow lines in London. Elsewhere, Hammond told reporters at a charity bike rally that the future will be 'exciting' for the three men, but refused to speculate further on the future of Top Gear. He said: 'Everybody knows what's happened. That's all been in the news. The future, nobody knows yet do they? 'And I cannot and won't speculate further than that. So don't know, let's see. It'll be exciting whatever.' There is mounting speculation the men are working on a new motoring series to be aired by Netflix, Amazon or another British broadcaster. Producer Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. Police investigated the attack but Tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would 'not be pursuing the matter any further.'

"Facing investigation: Rifaat al-Assad, 77, is being probed by French police over his £64million fortune . The uncle of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is facing a criminal investigation in France after amassing a £64million fortune despite being kicked out of Syria 'with nothing' 30 years ago. Prosecutors in Paris have revealed details of the year-long probe into Rifaat al-Assad's finances. Mr al-Assad, 77, went into exile in Europe after staging a failed coup against his brother Hafez al Assad, who was Syria's president at the time and is also Bashar's father. He has since spent more than 30 years living a life of luxury moving between homes in Paris, London and the southern Spanish city of Marbella. The inquiry into the former Syrian vice president's finances was triggered by Sherpa, an activist group representing the victims of financial crime, which claims his fortune was stolen during his time at the heart of the Syrian regime. His family's assets, outlined by French customs in a May 2014 report, are valued at around £64million - much of it held through a web of businesses based in Luxembourg. Mr al-Assad has vehemently denied acquiring assets in France through illegal means. He also told investigators he 'had nothing' when he left Syria, having always given his wages away to the poor, according to a source close to the investigation. 'It was (then French president) Francois Mitterrand who asked me to come to France... he was very kind,' he said, according to the source. On Friday, one of Mr al-Assad's lawyers said: 'Were there even the slightest doubt over my client's real estate ... would President Francois Mitterrand have awarded him the Legion d'Honneur (France's highest distinction) in 1986?' He told Reuters that his client's property holdings dated back to 1984-1986 and were transparent and legal. Heart of the regime: Rifaat al-Assad (left) is pictured with his brother, the late Syrian president Hafez al-Assad, in 1984 before his exile from the country . His nephew: Activists say Rifaat al-Assad (pictured in 1984, left), who is the uncle of current Syrian President Bashar (right), stole money from the country while operating at the heart of its government . His son Siwar al-Assad told France Info radio his father had received funds since 1984 from 'states, leaders and friends abroad'. That included a gift from the king of Saudi Arabia of a 45 hectare (111 acre) property and stud farm north of Paris, he said. Mr Al-assad claims he invested these gifts in property, but did not keep a close eye on the details. 'I only occupy myself with politics,' he said, according to the source. 'They bring me papers to sign... I don't know how to pay, even in restaurants.' Other members of the family have given evidence that Saudi backers have supported them ever since their exile in the 1980s. Another of Mr Al-assad's lawyers Benjamin Grundler says his client 'lives principally from the sale of apartments... and from the regular help of Saudi Arabia', stressing 'it is not Syrian money'. Defending his father: Siwar al-Assad -  the son of Rifaat al-Assad and Bashar's cousin - told France Info radio his father had received funds since 1984 from 'states, leaders and friends abroad' However, French Syria expert Fabrice Balanche, of CNRS University in Lyons, told the probe he is highly sceptical about the explanations. Speaking to investigators, he said: 'Saudi Arabia has no interest in supporting Rifaat, who doesn't represent anything.' Mr Al-assad commanded Syria's notorious internal security forces in the 1970s and early 1980s. Those forces carried out the bloody Hama massacre in 1982, which crushed a small Islamist uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood, killing between 10,000 and 25,000 civilians in the process, according to Amnesty International. Mr Al-assad has always denied having a leading role in the massacre.

"We are all guilty of taking the odd cheesy tourist photo, be it trying to push the Leaning Tower of Pisa, or 'touch' the top of a pyramid. One traveller in particular knows how wrong a holiday snap can go, after he posted a picture online of him 'missing' the top of the Eiffel Tower and asked users to help improve his photo. On a recent trip to Paris, Belgian food blogger Yves Van De Ven enjoyed poking fun at those tourist clichés and took a couple of pictures deliberately missing some of the more famous monuments. Little did he know he would become an internet sensation, after his photo with the Eiffel Tower captioned 'nailed it' was uploaded to photosharing website 4chan. Since then over 100 photoshopped pictures have sprung up comically connecting his finger with the tip of the famous attraction, and it didn't stop there... Nailed it! Yves Van De Ven, 37, uploaded this photograph on social media in a bid to poke fun of the typical tourist pictures . Going viral! An upload on photo-sharing site 4chan requested users connect his finger with the top of the tower, as many tourist pictures aim to achieve . The 37-year-old said he thought it would be hilarious to deliberately make fun of the typical pictures with famous landmarks. 'The original pictures in which me and my friends 'nailed it' were an instant hit with my friends as soon as I posted them on Facebook,' Van De Ven said. 'There were people that thought we just took poor pictures but luckily most of my friends know better.' Obviously the internet had something to say about the pictures and after someone uploaded the pictures to 4chan, users from all over the globe submitted their own 'improved' versions of Van De Ven's pictures. Created images ranged from the comical, with the 301m tower bent over to touch his outstretched finger, to the absurd, with Van De Ven imposed into Michaelango's Creation of Adam, reaching out towards the Eiffel Tower. The wondrous offerings demonstrate what a brilliant place the internet is, and how no one's holiday pictures are safe. Bendy tower! The tower appears to have flopped over in the summer heat, making a connection with the food blogger's finger . Cut out! Despite covering the 37-year-old, his finger is clearly in contact in this picture!

Despite the shoes having an eye-watering six inch heel, the star appeared unhindered and strolled easily around the finishing line with her husband David and her three sons. Victoria is a devotee of huge heels - in her early years  of fame she was never seen without a pair on and once said of flat shoes: 'I just can’t get my head around the footwear.' But recently she admitted in an interview with the Independent that she was now a convert, thanks to her busy lifestyle. She told the newspaper: 'I’m busier now – so I couldn’t totter around in a tight dress and a pair of heels! I think I feel a little more relaxed.' The star wore a pair of Alaïa Boots, which retail at approximately £1,500 . She continued: 'I suppose if I’m being honest, I would have been scared, right at the beginning, to wear lots of layers and to wear a flat shoe. 'I would have been scared to do that. Now I’m not.' But Victoria must find these boots extremely comfortable because she has been wearing them on a number of occasions recently. The Spice Girl wore them for a flight to London from LA last week and she also showcased them during an appearance on the Ellen show last week.

"An American doctor climbing Everest when the devastating earthquake hit has described the heartbreaking moment her mountain guide died before her eyes, . Ellen Gallant, a cardiologist from Utah, was attempting to climb the world's tallest mountain when the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck, sparking an avalanche that killed 18 people. Four US citizens who were on Mount Everest are confirmed to have died along with 15 other climbers and Sherpas. There are believed to be up to 100 Americans still missing following the disaster on Saturday. Scroll down for video .

The tremors sparked a huge avalance killing 18 people, with Ms Gallant and another doctor desperately trying to save those injured . An experienced climber, Dr Gallant (left) had been training for 10 years to climb Everest. She helped tend to survivors and those gravely injured before rescue helicopters arrived to get people off the mountainside . Survivor Dr Gallant said she and an Indian doctor rushed to help the injured in difficult conditions following the avalanche, including the gravely-ill Sherpa, but said there was nothing they could do to save his life. 'I was outside, saw this huge blast coming down', she told ABC News. 'I ran into the tent, threw myself on the floor. When the vibration stopped, I went out and radioed over to the medical tent. 'They asked me and an Indian climber (a doctor in the Indian army) to take care of head injuries. 'We worked through the night, doing rounds, handing out medication, putting in IVs. 'Of the nine patients, one of them died last night — a 25-year-old Sherpa. His blood pressure had fallen. There was nothing we could do.' Dr Gallant said they knew their lives were saved when they heard the sound of rescue helicopters landing on the mountainside, but now she is struggling to come to terms with what has happened. A critically injured person is carried on a stretcher out of Everest Base Camp following the avalanche. Dr Gallant said despite trying everything she watched a 25-year-old Sherpa die from his injuries on the mountain . The avalanche on Everest, pictured, killed 18 people including four Americans who were buried under the snow. Up to 100 US citizens are still missing following the disaster and at least 3,300 people were killed . Injured survivors from the avalanche waiting to be rescued. Dr Gallant said she is still dealing with the trauma of watching one young Sherpa died, saying: 'Now things have settled down, it's hit me hard'. 'Around 6am, we heard helicopters and we knew we would make it out of the woods. We were able to send the eight out,' she said. 'When you go to medical school, you learn to focus on the task at hand. But now that things have settled down, it's hit me hard. 'That young man who died in front of me — a 25-year-old shouldn't have to die.' Among the mountaineers who died in the disaster is a 33-year-old Google executive Dan Fredinburg Marisa Eve Girawong, a New Jersey-born doctor based at the site, and Tom Taplin, filmmaker from Denver who was recording a documentary about the treacherous summit. Dan Fredinburg, left, and Marisa Eve Girawong, right, died in the avalanche in Everest on Saturday . Californian financial advisor Scott Holder was on Everest when the devastating avalanche killed 18 people. He described how he had to zip a dead body into a sleeping bag, and was giving medicine to the injured when a doctor told him: 'Don’t worry, you are just comforting these people. Most of them are not going to survive.' Speaking to CNN, he said he felt lucky to be alive, having descended the mountain because he was suffering from a bad head cold. 'God definitely had his hand in my survival. My cold took me out of the danger zone. I guess you could say God gave me a cold.', he said. Read more here.

"The Home Office was warned that Lord Janner was abusing young boys two decades ago but did nothing about it . The Home Office was warned that Lord Janner was abusing young boys two decades ago but did nothing about it. An MP passed a dossier of information to the department in the hope it would kick-start a fresh police investigation. But instead the paperwork was shelved by officials until it was discovered in 2013 and belatedly passed to Leicestershire Police. The revelation will heighten fears that the peer, now 86, was the beneficiary of an Establishment cover-up. The missed opportunity to bring him to justice echoes the case of the late paedophile Liberal MP Cyril Smith who continued in public life despite repeated warnings of his crimes. It heaps pressure on the Home Office to reveal exactly who knew what and when about the disturbing allegations against Janner. Last night Labour’s Simon Danczuk – who outed Smith as a predatory child abuser – called on the department to ‘come clean’. ‘The Director of Public Prosecutions has admitted there were previously missed opportunities to investigate Lord Janner,’ he said. ‘The Home Office needs to come clean on what information was passed to officials in 1995. ‘This scandal is getting worse every day and the public are rightly angry at the shambolic way this case has been handled.’ Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders sparked fury earlier this month when she said Janner could face 22 charges but his health is too poor to put him on trial. She said that the former Leicester MP was investigated in 1991, 2002 and 2006 but mistakes meant he was never charged. Now the Daily Mail can reveal a fourth opportunity was missed when an unnamed MP passed a dossier to the Home Office in 1995. The politician received a letter linking Janner to prolific paedophile Frank Beck, who died in jail the previous year. Beck was jailed in 1991 for abusing children after a trial in which Janner was named by a victim, prompting him to proclaim his innocence in the Commons. The MP expected the 11 pages of detailed notes, which also identified several other suspects, to be passed to police. But nothing was done until it was uncovered during a review of Home Office archives in 2013. Labour MP Simon Danczuk is calling for the Home Office to 'come clean' over the dossier. The Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders earlier sparked fury by saying Lord Janner could face 22 charges . Lord Janner’s £2million home was transferred to his three children by someone holding power of attorney, officials have confirmed. The apartment near Hampstead Heath in North London was signed over free of charge in March last year – the same month police raided his Westminster office and three months after they searched his home. The apartment is likely to have been Janner’s most valuable asset, and the revelation raises questions about whether the Labour grandee – who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2009 – and his family planned for the possibility of being sued by his alleged victims. In 2013, paedophile BBC presenter Stuart Hall signed over the deeds of his £2million mansion to his wife just before he was jailed. He then offered his victims as little as £2,000 compensation. Home Secretary Theresa May ordered the review over fears her department was holding evidence of historic child abuse by influential people. A trawl through more than 700,000 documents identified four ‘items’ that should be passed to police. In a heavily censored report, one document involved the paedophile ring led by Beck which preyed on vulnerable children at Leicestershire care homes. It stated: ‘Allegations from XX that XX could have been involved in the child abuse along with convicted paedophile Frank Beck. The writer… also claimed that some police investigations had already taken place but there is no evidence that the Home Office passed the complete information to police.’ Michael Howard was Home Secretary when the MP sent the letter warning about Janner to his department. A spokesman for the former Tory leader, who is now a peer, said he had ‘no recollection’ of seeing the dossier but believes such material should have been forwarded to police. Soon after the publication of the Theresa May review, a second, more in-depth report homed in on allegations against Janner in August 2014. Conducted by NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless, it specifically asked Government departments to search their archives for mentions of ‘Greville Janner’. When the report was published in November it revealed a file on Janner was among 114 dossiers on child sex abuse that went missing from the Home Office. Last night, the Home Office highlighted how both reviews did not directly accuse it of covering up information on child abuse.","MP handed dossier of information to the department to kick-start a probe .

"The idea that your tongue is separated into ‘zones’ for different tastes has been widely debunked - although the exact process taking place is still poorly understood. But now, for the first time, scientists have created a live imaging map of the tongue's taste buds to determine what happens each time we place food in our mouths. It reveals how taste buds have different cells that are used to differentiate between between the five basic groups of flavours. A Harvard-led study has mapped taste buds on a tongue for the first time. Scientists examined the different cells used to identify taste and watched these cells capture and process molecules live. Shown is a taste bud with receptor cells (green), blood cells (red) and collagen surrounding the bud (blue) The research was conducted by an international team that included the Australian National University (ANU) and the Harvard Medical School. They used a specially designed microscope system to image single cells on the tongue of a mouse. Shining a bright infrared laser on the mouse’s tongue caused different parts of it and ‘flavour molecules’ to fluoresce. Penguins lost three of the five basic vertebrate tastes - sweet, bitter and the savoury, meaty taste known as umami - more than 20 million years ago and never regained them, researchers have found. Researchers say the genes were lost after cold Antarctic temperatures interfered with taste perception. University of Michigan researchers said they were surprised by the discovery . Because penguins are fish eaters, the loss of the umami taste is especially perplexing, said study leader Dr Jianzhi 'George' Zhang, a professor in the U-M Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Dr Zhang suspects the sensory changes are tied to ancient climate-cooling events in Antarctica, where penguins originated. Using a method called intravital multiphoton microscopy, the scientists were then able to pick out individual taste cells within each bud. They were also able to spot blood vessels up to 240 microns - 240 millionths of a metre (0.0024mm) - below the surface of the tongue. ‘We've watched live taste cells capture and process molecules with different tastes,’ said biomedical engineer Dr Steve Lee, from ANU. There are more than 2,000 taste buds on the human tongue, which can distinguish at least five tastes: salty, sweet, sour, bitter and umami - a word used to describe smooth and typically savoury, meaty sensations. However, the relationship between the many taste cells within a taste bud, and our perception of taste, has been a long-standing mystery, said Professor Seok-Hyun Yun from Harvard Medical School. ‘With this new imaging tool we have shown that each taste bud contains taste cells for different tastes,’ said Professor Yun. The breakthrough complements recent studies by other research groups that identified the areas in the brain associated with taste. Interestingly, the results showed that taste cells respond not only to molecules contacting the surface of the tongue, but also to molecules in the blood circulation. The researchers used a specially designed microscope system to image single cells on the tongue of a mouse. Shining a bright infrared laser on the mouse’s tongue caused different parts of it to fluoresce. The tongue is shown here, with taste buds in blue, among yellow papillae, or small bumps in the tongue's tissue . Using a method called intravital multiphoton microscopy, the scientists were able to pick out individual taste cells within each taste bud. Dr Steve Lee from The Australian National University (ANU) is seen here working on a laser microscope system at the ANU Research School of Engineering . According to Assistant Professor Myunghwan (Mark) Choi from the Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea, this suggests tasting might ‘involve an interaction between the food taken orally and blood composition.’ The team now hopes to develop an experiment to monitor the brain while imaging the tongue to track the full process of taste sensation. However to fully understand the complex interactions that form our basic sense of taste could take years, Dr Lee added. ‘Until we can simultaneously capture both the neurological and physiological events, we can't fully unravel the logic behind taste,’ he said. The findings were published in the journal Nature.","Harvard-led study mapped taste buds on a tongue for the first time .

"A mother sat in anguish yesterday as she heard how her two children died because of three blunders by staff maintaining a gas boiler at the holiday hotel. Sharon Wood listened intently as the details of how they were killed by fumes at the four-star Corfu hotel were outlined at an inquest. Christianne Shepherd, seven, and her brother Robert, six, were overcome by carbon monoxide that leaked from a faulty boiler as a ‘happy and relaxed’ family holiday in Corfu ended in ‘appalling tragedy’. Christi Shepherd, seven, (left) and her brother Bobby, six, (right) died from carbon monoxide poisoning during a holiday in Corfu in October 2006. Their father Neil Shepherd – who is Mrs Wood’s ex-husband – and his partner Ruth Beatson fell into a coma and were close to death when they were found the next morning by a maid, along with the bodies of the children. The couple recovered after emergency treatment. Yesterday, Mrs Wood, 44, sat in silence as the details of her children’s final hours were related to the inquest jury at Wakefield Coroner’s Court, nine years after the tragedy. Scenes of the youngsters playing together were shown on a large screen as the background was outlined. Commenting on the inquest – which has been delayed partly because of ongoing legal proceedings – coroner David Hinchliff said: ‘The family of these children have waited a long, long time for this day.’ The jury was told how Mr Shepherd had booked the £2,000 holiday to the Greek island with Thomas Cook. The family were put in a bungalow at the Louis Corcyra Beach Hotel. On the third day of the trip in October 2006, Christi felt ‘unwell’ and Bobby tripped and fell after feeling dizzy. Mr Hinchliff said they went to bed at 11.30pm. In the night Mr Shepherd, now 46, went to his daughter when she was heard crying and Miss Beatson, who is now his wife, went to Bobby who was ‘whimpering’. Their father, Neil Shepherd, and his girlfriend Ruth Beatson, (together, left) who he has since married, were also almost killed by the fumes. Pictured right is the children's' mother Sharon Wood, with her husband Paul . The bungalow at the four-star Corcyra Beach Hotel in Corfu, where Bobby and Christi had been staying with their father and his girlfriend . The bungalow is taped off and examined following the discovery of the children's bodies in October 2006 . Tests showed the family had suffered carbon monoxide poisoning. The cause was identified as the gas-fired hot water boiler in an outhouse next to the bedrooms. Thomas Magner, a boiler expert hired to investigate by Thomas Cook, discovered the boiler covered in rust from water leakage. He identified a series of blunders, the inquest heard. The boiler had been installed without a ‘chimney’ or flue to take out unwanted fumes. Second, a ‘protection device’ designed to cut out the boiler if it overheated had been disabled as late as the day before the tragedy, to avoid a worker having to come and relight the boiler when it was tripped off, the inquest heard. Third, a crude hole in the outhouse internal wall enabled fumes to pass into the bedrooms. The hole has been made for air conditioning pipes, but had not been sealed. There was also a water leak which caused the boiler to work longer and dangerous gases to build up. The leak should have been obvious from the rust but it was not fixed. Mr Magner said tests showed a ‘massive’ concentration of carbon monoxide and the children were hardest hit because their room was closest to the source. Commenting on the workmanship, Mr Hinchliff asked: ‘Was it bodged or botched?’ Mr Magner replied: ‘You would say it was bodged.’ The inquest was told problems with the boiler were first reported five months earlier. Boilers at the hotel had been installed about eight years before the tragedy and evidence indicated dangerously faulty boilers throughout the site. The family were initially not supposed to have been staying in the bungalow but were switched to number 112 because the room they were allocated was unsuitable. The inquest heard 112 had become available because the previous occupants had become unwell and were detained in hospital for tests and treatment. No further details were revealed. The hearing continues. Mr and Mrs Wood with Mr and Mrs Shepherd, pictured in 2006. The two couples are on good terms and have battled for the facts of the case to be heard in the UK . The inquest jury was told that the family arrived at their hotel on October 23 2006, and they were initially offered a room in the main block because there was a problem with the accommodation they had booked .

In a letter he sent to his strategic management students, Professor Irwin Horwitz claimed that he had seen cheating, heard false rumors about himself and other students and had been called a 'f****** moron' to his face. Horwitz's email said that every single student in the approximately 30-person class would fail because of the behavior he had witnessed during the semester. The university has said that the failing grades Horwitz's wishes to give out will not hold. Texas A&M, Galveston, professor Irwin Horwitz emailed his strategic management class of about 30 students telling them he was going to fail all of them because of the bad behavior he had seen during the semester . In the email - he sent a similar one to administrators - he claimed students cheated in class and participated in 'inappropriate conduct' His email to his students read: 'None of you, in my opinion, given the behavior in this class, deserve to pass, or graduate to become an Aggie, as you do not in any way embody the honor that the university holds graduates should have within their personal character. 'Since teaching this course, I have caught and seen cheating, been told to ‘chill out,’ ‘get out of my space,’ ‘go back and teach,’ [been] called a ‘f****** moron’ to my face, [had] one student cheat by signing in for another, one student not showing up but claiming they did, listened to many hurtful and untrue rumors about myself and others, been caught between fights between students…. 'None of you, in my opinion, given the behavior in this class, deserve to pass, or graduate to become an Aggie, as you do not in any way embody the honor that the university holds graduates should have within their personal character. 'It is thus for these reasons why I am officially walking away from this course. I am frankly and completely disgusted. 'You all lack the honor and maturity to live up to the standards that Texas A&M holds, and the competence and/or desire to do the quality work necessary to pass the course just on a grade level…. I will no longer be teaching the course, and all are being awarded a failing grade.' Inside Higher Ed . 'It is thus for these reasons why I am officially walking away from this course. I am frankly and completely disgusted. 'You all lack the honor and maturity to live up to the standards that Texas A&M holds, and the competence and/or desire to do the quality work necessary to pass the course just on a grade level…. I will no longer be teaching the course, and all are being awarded a failing grade.' Horwitz, who has taught at the college level for 20 years, sent a similar email to senior administrators telling them what he had done, according to Inside Higher Ed. He predicted that his students would protest his decision and told administration that the students were 'your problem now'. A university spokesman said that across-the-board failing grades would be re-evaluated. 'No student who passes the class academically will be failed. That is only the right thing to do,' he said. He added that Horwitz's accusations are being investigated and 'disciplinary action will be taken' against those students who behaved inappropriately. Horwitz, who said he will not teach the class again, called his class's behavior 'disgraceful' and told KPRC that he had never failed a class before and rarely gave out failing grades. 'I was dealing with cheating, dealing with individuals swearing at me both in and out of class, it got to the point that the school had to put security guards at that class and another class,' he said. 'Sometimes learning incorporates tough love.' Vice President of Academic Affairs Patrick Lauchouarn said that Horwitz cannot give failing grades to an entire class and each student will be judged academically by the department head rather than Horwitz for the remainder of the semester . He said that his students told him to 'chill out' and cited student cheating in his email. 'It became apparent that they couldn't do some of the most simple and basic things they should have been able to do,' Horwitz told KPRC. Vice President of Academic Affairs Patrick Lauchouarn said that Horwitz cannot give failing grades to an entire class, especially before the end of the semester, in May. 'None of them have failed until the end of the class, meaning the only reason a student would fail because he or she has not performed the expectations for that particular class,' he said. The department head at the university will teach the course for the remainder of the semester and grades will be evaluated based on academics, school officials said. Horowitz said he would not teach the strategic management class again at the Galveston campus (pictured) and that in his 20 years of teaching he had never failed an entire class .","Texas A&M, Galveston professor Irwin Horwitz sent an email to his strategic management class telling the approximately-30-person class would all fail .

"'Insta-fame' is the latest criterion for models wanting to book jobs, according to leading Australian modelling agencies. While being beautiful, fit and healthy is expected, it's all about a demand for the 'influencer' now. Thanks to the proliferation of social media, in order for modelling agencies to keep up with client demand, 'influencer' and 'blogger' divisions are now being added to their traditional model portfolio. General manager of Vivien's Models Catherine McGill told Daily Mail Australia that they launched an 'influencers' section two months ago because of the growing need to accommodate client demand for social media numbers. Scroll down for video . Influencer: Gigi Hadid is one of many in-demand models whose social media following is as much a draw card as her good looks for clients booking her on jobs . Self-made model: Mimi Elashiry turned her social media following into a modelling career . Big on Instagram: Elashiry has almost 700,000 followers . 'Our bookers  were giving me feedback that clients wanted models who might be blonde, beachy and had a high social media following,' she said. 'Now when we’re booking talent, in negotiation process, we talk about the girls numbers.' McGill says the average expectation of clients will range anywhere between 10,000 - 300,000 followers. 'It’s not hard and fast number, but 10,000 is the minimum number clients are asking for,' she said. 'So if models are getting up to that, they might get added to our 'Influencer' page.' Joseph Tenni of Chadwick Models told News.com.au that 'It’s not unusual for a client to ask “how many followers does she have?” before they ask what they look like.' Chic Management also started a 'blogger' management division two years ago. Of influencer: Prestigious model agency Vivien's has introduced an 'Influencer' page noting their models' social media stats . 'That line of just being a model is being blurred': Bloggers and influencers are now being snapped up by agencies capitalising on their following . General Manager Paul Thomas says it's now where all the money is being spent, with clients seeking hard and fast brand promotion. 'If you  think about it, your brand can send their product straight to someone's pocket rather than printing a catalogue in store and waiting for a customer go collect it.' Thomas told Daily Mail Australia it's all about the elusive 'cool girl' appeal. 'Influencers are like a captain of the ship - because there is so much information out there, people turn to models, fashion people and talent and begin liking what they are liking.' 'We do have clients that  book in a traditional sense, but new up-and-coming brands want a ‘cool girl’ with vast social numbers that they can book a campaign off the back of the model's social media,' he said. It's this combination of 'cool girl' meets followers and a 'lust-have' lifestyle that Thomas said is really drawing in clients, and models are now being trained how to self-promote on their Instagram to get work. International: American Alexis Ren has over 1.6million followers, and is in demand Down Under as much for her looks as her army of followers . 'Now that line of just being a model is being blurred, people want to know about the model but it's got to be organic, you can smell when it’s all a bit too staged,' he said. Thomas said health and fitness is very 'on brand' at the moment, so that's something the girls are encouraged to promote, which most of them naturally will as they stay in shape. 'With new faces we sit down with them and do social media training, to make sure those girls are representing us as well. We don’t need them to be serious posters, just once or twice a day, or one every day.' Chic manage American model Alexis Ren, who has over 1.6 million followers and has shot previous campaigns for Australian label General Pants. 'She has 1.6 million followers, a  huge following in Australia, her boyfriend is this amazingly good looking surfie and her Instagram is a mood board that makes you want to be on holidays with them.' Thomas said it's a coup for Australian brands because she is not only 5’8, beautiful and blonde  but  she is 'insta-famous', has an increase of 45,000 followers per week and has a boyfriend with almost a million followers, so they have the tools they need to sell her as a talent. Chic Management also says bloggers like Sarah Donaldson from Harper and Harley and Brooke Testoni have scored major campaigns with Oral B and Pandora  based on their social outreach and style.","Australian model agencies reveal new demand for social media following .

"An Alberta student who'd accidentally left his headlights on all day was greeted by what may have been the world's friendliest note from a stranger when he returned to his car. But Derek Murray, a University of Alberta law student, found more than just the note that cold November day in Edmonton--he also found an extension cord and battery charger left by the stranger to bring his dead Acura back to life. Now that Murray's life-affirming tale has now gone viral, he says 'It just shows you how such a pure act of kindness from one person can just spread through everyone and help make everyone’s day a little brighter.' Good Samaritan: A friendly stranger left this unbelievably friendly letter to Alberta law student Derek Murray in order to help him get his car started after he left the headlights on all day . At first, though, he assumed the letter was from an angry fellow motorist, he told the National Post. 'When I first saw the note, I was expecting it to be an angry letter from someone telling me not to park there. Instead, I got someone just totally brightening my day. My day could have been ruined but, because of this guy, it was the highlight of my day.' The note reads, in part: . I noticed you left your lights on. The battery will probably not have enough charge to start your vehicle. I left a blue extension cord on the fence and a battery charger beside the fence in the cardboard box. If you know how to hook it up, use it to start your car. What followed was a detailed explanation of how to use the equipment. 'Sure enough,' Derek recalled to the National Post, 'I looked over at the house my car was parked beside, and there was a blue extension cord plugged into an outlet behind the guy’s house with a battery charger right there beside it.' Derek was able to get his car started, but when he rang the good Samaritan's doorbell, there was no answer. So, Derek left his own note as a thank you for the kind gesture. He later snapped a photo of the stranger's friendly note to post to Facebook, where it has now gone viral. The note has been viewed millions of times and even Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson retweeted the photo. Derek snapped a photo of the note for Facebook and it has since gone viral. e 'It just shows you how such a pure act of kindness from one person can just spread through everyone and help make everyone’s day a little brighter,’ Derek said .","Derek Murray, a University of Alberta law student, could have had his day ruined by the mistake by a stranger's kindness brightened it up .

"The mother of a girl who was murdered 40 years ago has spoke of the horror of recently seeing crime scene photos of her daughter's body. Virginia Trimble Ritter's daughter, Marcia, was raped and choked to death by Jerome Sydney Barrett in 1975. Marcia's body was found 33 days after she disappeared and Ritter's then-husband advised her against seeing the body and the crime scene photos. The mother of a girl who was murdered 40 years ago finally asked to see the crime scene photos of her daughter's body and now says she wants revenge. Virginia Trimble Ritter's daughter, Marcia, was raped and choked to death by Jerome Sydney Barrett in 1975 . Marcia's body was found 33 days after she disappeared and Ritter's then-husband advised her against seeing the body and the crime scene photos . Charlie, who died in 1989, wanted their last memory to be of her running in and out of the house, 'the real Marcia.' But Ritter told The Tennessean, last year it was a decision she now regrets. 'I have never seen a close-up photo and I want to. I'm going to.' She had declined to see the photos for several decades, and not even after Barrett was convicted 33 years later. But last year she asked Mickey Miller, Metro police lead investigator who worked on the case if she could see them. She says he tried to convince her not to see them, but she persisted and she viewed them on his laptop. Jerome Sidney Barrett, 68, was found guilty of second-degree murder six years ago and a Davidson County Criminal Court jury imposed a sentence of 44 years (pictured in 2009) 'Her mouth was black,' Ritter said. 'And her face, her head was swollen. It didn't look like Marcia. But to see her other parts of her body looked like Marcia. She said her daughter had vomit across her, her hair was pulled out in parts and there was blood on her scalp. Ritter said she shouted, 'If I had a gun I'd kill him!' Marcia's body was found 150 yards from her home amid the clutter of a rarely used, windowless garage, under a shower curtain and a child's wading pool. She had been strangled and sexually assaulted, and her cookie money was missing. Cookies were scattered around the clothed body. A neck bone was fractured. The case was Nashville's most notorious unsolved murder for 33 years. In 1979 police charged a Trimble neighbor with the slaying, but prosecutors dropped the charges about a year later because of lack of evidence. He was 15 at the time of the crime. Barrett, 68, was living in Memphis when he was arrested in 2006. He was brought in after police matched the DNA on the murdered child's clothing to that of his. The match happened after he was arrested for the 1975 murder of Vanderbilt University student Sarah Vannatta Des Prez. Barrett had been in prison on sex charges between 1974 and 2002 except for about a year when Marcia disappeared. In 2009 he was found guilty of second-degree murder of Marcia and a Davidson County Criminal Court jury imposed a sentence of 44 years.","Virginia Trimble Ritter's daughter, Marcia, was raped and choked to death by Jerome Sydney Barrett in 1975 .

"Looking after elderly parents can be difficult at the best of times. But this man takes caring for his Alzheimer's-suffering mother to another level. A security guard from China has touched hearts across the country because he takes his 84-year-old mother with him to work on the back of his motorbike every single day, reported the People's Daily Online. Lu Xincai, who lives in Zhejiang province in eastern China, says that he is scared his mother will get lost if he leaves her at home by herself because she suffers from the degenerative disease. Devoted: Lu Xincai takes his 84-year-old mother to work with him on the back of his motorbike every day. He ties a sash around both of their waists to make sure she doesn't fall off . She would often go up to the mountains to collect firewood and there were a few occasions when she got lost after dark. When Mr Lu's father passed away earlier this year, he decided to take his mother with him to work because there was no one else who could look after her. His wife works in a different city and his son is still in school. After helping his mother to get up at 5am every morning, he puts her on the back seat of his motorbike and ties a sash around both of their waists to ensure that she does not fall off. Mr Lu said that he rides the four kilometres to work slowly to make sure his mother feels safe and so that they can chat along the way. The whole journey takes an hour. Even when at work he checks up on his mother, who has been given her own room by his employers, a bank, to make sure that she has not wandered off somewhere. He said that his mother devoted her life to caring for her children, and now he feels like he has a duty to care for her in return. Vulnerable: His elderly mother suffers from Alzheimer's and used to get lost when she was left alone . He said: 'I was an apple in my mum's eye, and now she's my apple.' 'Our mother carried us on her back to the fields when she went to work on the farm and collect firewood when we were young.' He added: 'Only if I see her will I feel relaxed. Otherwise I would be afraid is she had wandered away.'","Lu Xincai says no one else can look after his 84-year-old mother .

"A midwife has today accepted her mistakes 'contributed' to the deaths of two babies at a scandal-hit maternity unit. Marie Teresa Ratcliffe refused to defend herself against a raft of misconduct charges, choosing not to show up at her fitness to practise hearing at the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). She also declined to send a lawyer in her place. The panel has been told Ms Ratcliffe accepts 77 allegations relating to her care and treatment of 14 patients at the scandal-hit Furness General Hospital in Cumbria between February 2004 and September 2013. Former midwife Marie Ratcliffe refused to defend herself against 77 misconduct charges at a fitness to practise hearing in front of the Nursing and Midwifery Council. She worked at the scandal-hit Furness General Hospital where Joshua Titcombe, pictured, died at just nine days old . They include the allegations that, in relation to two babies - one of whom died in February 2004 and another in September 2008 - Ms Ratcliffe's conduct 'contributed to the death' of, and/or caused the patient's baby 'to lose a significant chance of survival'. The allegations against Ms Ratcliffe also included claims she failed to adequately monitor patients, record key observations in patient notes or request assistance from doctors. Amanda Hamilton, representing the NMC, read out a letter written by Ms Ratcliffe which said that she will 'regret what happened for the rest of my life'. Ms Ratcliffe told the panel she is no longer a midwife, and has no intentions of returning to the profession. In the letter read to the NMC panel, sitting in Stratford, east London, Ms Ratcliffe said: 'I am a human being of good will and I accept that I have made mistakes and apologise to those affected by them.' In the letter, Ms Ratcliffe said she felt 'it was important not to delay' proceedings any further or efforts for people to look in to what happened by 'defending myself against these charges'. She denied being part of any cover-up or collusion of what had happened or effort to 'conceal the truth'. In March, an independent investigation into what happened at Furness General Hospital between 2004 and 2013, found failures led to the avoidable deaths of 11 babies and one mother . Marie Ratcliffe is the first of eight midwives accused of misconduct and poor care at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Foundation Trust to appear before the NMC. In March, the independent inquiry into the failings at Morecambe Bay, led by Bill Kirkup, found failures at the trust led to the avoidable deaths of at least 11 babies and one mother. Feuding medics, an obsession with natural childbirth, and a tight knit group of midwives who dubbed themselves 'The Musketeers' contributed to a 'distressing chain of events' which led to avoidable harm to mothers and babies, at Furness General Hospital in Barrow, Cumbria. The independent investigation into serious incidents at the hospital between 2004 and 2013 uncovered a series of failures 'at every level' - from the maternity unit to those responsible for regulating and monitoring the trust which runs the unit. The report slammed the clinical competence of staff, a 'them and us' culture between midwives, obstetricians and paeditricians and an over-zealous pursuit of natural childbirth 'at all costs' by a small group of dominant midwives. It found 'shocking' substandard clinical competence, extremely poor working relationships between different staff groups and repeated failure to investigate adverse incidents properly and learn lessons. And the report suggests that when babies died, midwives conspired to cover up the failings. In total eight midwives who worked at the trust could face disciplinary action. The NMC said last year that four midwives should face hearings. Meanwhile another four midwives are still the subject of further investigations. She noted that the system had been flawed but that she was governed by those procedures. She stated that 'in writing these words I seek no leniency' adding 'I accept things I cannot change.' Panel chairman Gary Leong said: 'By her letter Ms Ratcliffe is aware of the proceedings. 'She has voluntarily absented herself. She is very clear that she does not wish to defend herself against these charges. 'In light of that the panel considers that an adjournment would not change the circumstances. She does not wish to come.' He said the hearing is a matter of public interest, and as such will continue today. The proceedings will hear from two of the women who were under the care of the former midwife when they lost their baby. The hearing was told about the first incident occurred in 2004 in relation to the mother referred to a Patient A. Ms Hamilton, for the NMC, said another midwife present at the birth said the baby 'was placed by the side of Patient A and appeared purple, blue and lifeless'. The baby was taken to a specialist unit in Liverpool Women's Hospital where it died on February 26, 2004. The second death of a baby occurred in September 2008. Other allegations she faces in regards to the Patient B's baby include a failure to record or observe maternal blood pressure and that she failed to adequately monitor and/or ensure the foetal heart rate was normal. The misconduct hearing, which is expected to last a month, will hear from several witnesses including the two patients who lost their children. The hearing heard that Ms Ratcliffe qualified as a midwife in 1990 and in 1997 she was promoted to a Band 7 Midwife at Furness General Hospital, part of the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, where she worked until January 2014. The hearing continues.","Marie Ratcliffe accepts 77 allegations of misconduct and poor care .

"A man has been arrested after crashing through two fences and sprinting from police onto a runway during an eight-minute chase at a Utah airport. The events unfolded during a routine traffic stop after airport police tried to stop the car with its bumper dragging. The chase then started on a public road near Salt Lake City International Airport on Monday at 3am. Leo Greene, 39, of Salt Lake City was asked to hand over the keys to his car by police when he drove off, crashed through the fence lines and onto the tarmac area before crashing into another fence. Leo Greene, 39, of Salt Lake City has been arrested after crashing through two fences and sprinting from police onto a runway at the Salt Lake City International Airport on Monday at 3am . He was arrested and now faces multiple charges including driving under the influence, fleeing and resisting arrest. Greene is also being booked for property damage and driving onto the loading area of an airport, as well as driving with an open container and on a license revoked for an alcohol-related offense. On Monday morning, Leo told police he was looking for a place to change a flat tire, according to a police report. When they asked for his keys, he drove off and crashed into the two fences. Greene then jumped out of the car and ran to a shed before he was forced to the ground and arrested. Salt Lake City International Airport officials said no flights or passengers were affected because there was not airfield activity at the time. The fence damages are estimated at $4,500. 'It doesn't sound very nefarious,' said Dave Korzep, the airport's superintendent of operations. Greene faces multiple charges including driving under the influence, fleeing and resisting arrest. He is also being booked for property damage and driving into the loading area of an airport with an open container and on a license revoked for an alcohol-related offense (above northwest tarmac area of the airport) 'Just a lack of common sense, driving under the influence, making wrong choices.' Officials said Greene suffered minor injuries during the foot chase and was taken to a hospital. An Associated Press investigation this month found eight other security perimeter breaches at the airport in the last decade. None of the 268 security breaches at 31 major U.S. airports between January 2004 and January 2015 that were documented by the AP were terrorism-related. Airports also say breaches are relatively rare, although intoxicated drivers crashing through barriers is not uncommon. The AP sought comment on the charges from Greene, but he was still in police custody. It was not immediately clear whether he had an attorney.","Leo Greene, 39, of Salt Lake City crashed through airport fence on Monday .

"A Houston father was upset to learn that his five-year-old daughter was disciplined for wearing her rainbow spaghetti-strap sundress to school, where teachers said that it violated the dress code. Jef Rouner wrote in the Houston Press that his daughter was forced to cover up with jeans and a t-shirt when she was told that the spaghetti straps of her 'full-length' dress were 'against the rules'. 'We still live in a country where someone can decide the shoulders of, and I can't stress this enough, a five-year-old girl are so distracting that they must be sent away and decently hidden,' he said. Kiddie clothes: Jef Rouner said his five-year-old daughter was forced to cover up when she wore this spaghetti-strap sundress to her school in Houston, Texas . 'She'd had her heart set on wearing her rainbow sundress since the weather warmed up,' recalled Mr. Rouner. He didn't hesitate to let her wear the multicolor frock, which he bad bought from a  store in the mall and previously let her wear to church. 'I didn't pick up my daughter's dress at My First Stripperwear,' he insisted. 'It's not repurposed fetish gear from a store for very short people.' But despite the striped dress being what Routner believes is completely age-appropriate, his daughter is now 'wordlessly accepting that a dress with spaghetti straps, something sold in every Walmart in America right now, is somehow bad.' Supportive pop: Jef said he finds it 'weird' that school dress codes tend to offer more restrictions for girls than boys . Favorite frock: As the weather has gotten warmer, Jef said, his daughter grew excited to wear the striped dress, which she had worn to church in the past . Mr. Rouner took particular issue with the fact that school dress codes almost exclusively target girls, banning items of clothing that aren't even sold in the boy's sections of stores. Though rules against exposing the chest and torso could theoretically apply to boys as well, he explained, boy's clothing simply isn't made to show skin in the same places as girls' clothing. 'Essentially, a school dress code exists to prevent girls from displaying too much of their bodies,' he said, adding that most restrictions in his own daughter's school dress code were female-specific. Taking a stand: The vocal father said he won't stop his daughter from wearing the dress again in the future . He went on to note that it is particularly outrageous to discriminate between boys' and girls' clothing at his daughter's age  Cut her hair, he said, and his five-year-old would look no different from a boy. Since he still sees no problem with the sundress, Mr. Rouner said he won't stop his daughter from wearing it in the future - and will tell her that she looks 'cute as a button to boot'. And if anyone tells her to change her clothes? The outspoken father said he will tell his daughter to ask 'why' until she gets an answer she likes.","Jef Rouner from Houston, Texas says his daughter was forced to wear jeans and a t-shirt with her spaghetti-strap sundress .

"Nicola Sturgeon today threatened to 'change the direction' of the UK parliament without even becoming an MP as the SNP stepped up its demands on Labour. The SNP leader insisted she would call the shots in the event of a hung parliament, even though she is not even standing for election to the Commons. And she vowed to use the influence of dozens of MPs to get her way for the next five years without voting down the government. Scroll down for video . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, pictured today in Kilmarnock, insisted she would call the shots in the event of a hung parliament, even though she is not even standing for election to the Commons . Ms Sturgeon said that Mr Miliband will 'have to reflect how people have voted and they will have to on a practical level be prepared to talk to others and compromise with others in order to get their policies through' Ms Sturgeon has made clear she would act to 'lock' the Tories out of power and prop up a Labour government. The SNP have enjoyed a surge in popularity since September's referendum on independence, despite 55 per cent of people voting stay in the UK. A new opinion poll by TNS puts the SNP on 54 per cent, up two points on two weeks ago, with Labour down two points to 22 per cent. Labour now faces the prospect of near-wipeout north of the border, robbing Ed Miliband of his chances of an overall majority. However, Ms Sturgeon has made clear she would act to 'lock' the Tories out of power and prop up a Labour government. Both sides have ruled out a formal coalition, and yesterday Mr Miliband said he had 'made it clear we're not interested' in deals, such as a 'confidence and supply' arrangement where the SNP would agree to back Labour on important votes such as the Budget. But Ms Sturgeon insists that after polling day, Labour will be forced to do as she says. 'Ed Miliband can say what he wants right now, he's entitled to do so, but he can't deny reality,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'If there is a situation after the election where neither of the big parties has a majority they will have to reflect how people have voted and they will have to on a practical level be prepared to talk to and compromise with others in order to get their policies through. 'Now, whether that's as part of a formal deal, or on an issue-by-issue basis it gives parties like the SNP enormous clout and enormous influence.' A new opinion poll by TNS puts the SNP on 54 per cent, up two points on two weeks ago, with Labour down two points to 22 per cent . Support for the SNP has soared since the independence referendum in September, when 55 per cent of people voted against leaving the UK . Labour leader Ed Miliband, arriving at the Arc Arts Centre in Stockton-on-Tees with local candidate Louise Baldock, said he had 'made it clear we're not interested' in deals, such as a 'confidence and supply' arrangement where the SNP would agree to back Labour on important votes such as the Budget . A briefing by Lord Mandelson's company suggests the SNP will be the real winners of the election . The SNP will emerge as the winners from the general election whatever happens on May 7, Peter Mandelson's firm has warned. Global Counsel, the consultancy chaired by the former Labour Cabinet minister, warns Labour will be pulled to the left if SNP calls the shots. 'Labour may be wary of the SNP, because it knows an arrangement with the party could annoy some English voters, but it may have little choice if it is to form the next government,' the company said in a pre-election briefing. Analyst Gregor Irwin says the SNP will have 'maximum leverage' soon after the election and will seek to 'pull the Labour party to the left, away from the centre ground of English politics'. 'This will include pushing Labour towards higher public spending,' he adds. The company has made clear that the document are the personal views of Mr Irwin, a former chief economist to the foreign office. She insisted that she will lead any talks with the next UK government, despite the fact that she is not standing as an MP. Angus Robertson is currently the SNP leader in Westminster, while Alex Salmond – who is set to return to the Commons – had also been viewed as a potential powerbroker. Ms Sturgeon made clear that she will be in charge: 'I am the leader of the SNP and therefore if there are discussions to be had after the election, I will lead those. 'I am the leader of the SNP and people voting SNP know that and I don't think are under any illusions about that.' Polls continue to suggest that neither Labour or the Tories will get an overall majority, leaving them to rely on smaller parties to form a government. Ms Sturgeon said that Mr Miliband will 'have to reflect how people have voted and they will have to on a practical level be prepared to talk to others and compromise with others in order to get their policies through'. She added: 'Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act it is possible for other parties to change the direction of a government without bringing a government down. That gives enormous influence.' The SNP leader rejected the suggestion that her party was more austere than Labour, insisting 'every single penny' had been passed on from grants to the health service. Ms Sturgeon said: 'We are putting forward as part of our anti-austerity argument the fact we would vote for considerable increases in health spending across the UK to meet the terms of the Stevens Report and ensure as we go into the next decade the health service is properly equipped to face up to the challenges it will meet.' She added: 'As long as Westminster decisions affect Scotland it matters to the SNP and it matters to Scotland that those decisions are good decisions, to we have a vested interest in making sure the politics at Westminster is better politics.' Tory Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'When Ed Miliband's biggest union paymaster is saying that he will be forced to do deals with the SNP, it's no surprise that Nicola Sturgeon knows she will be pulling Ed Miliband's strings if he gets into Downing Street. 'Working people will pay the price for an Ed Miliband government that's propped up by the SNP – through more debt, more borrowing and more taxes.' Green Party leader Natalie Bennett has had to pull out of her party’s housing policy campaign launch after losing her voice . Green Party leader Natalie Bennett has had to pull out of her party’s housing policy campaign launch after losing her voice. Ms Bennett - who had been due to set out her party’s plans to control rents during a visit to a south London housing estate - was said to be “resting” ahead of her battle bus launch tomorrow. Earlier she dismissed suggestions that Labour had stole their thunder, dismissing their proposals as a “watered down” version of what the Greens are offering. She told BBC Breakfast: “We need to move away from thinking of homes primarily as financial assets and go back to thinking they are safe places for people to live.” The Greens would also abolish right to buy, she said, and build 500,000 social homes on brownfield sites over the course of the next parliament. The party would link a cap on annual rent increases to the consumer price index, as part of a package of measures to make the private rented sector fairer for tenants. It is also calling for a Living Rent Commission to investigate ways to bring rent levels down. Ms Bennett said: “At the moment, the private rental market is structured in a way that benefits landlords over tenants, and treats homes as investment vehicles. “As more people rent, rather than own, their homes, it is vital that we correct this imbalance. “Keeping rent rises in line with inflation will reduce poverty and allow tenants a better standard of living. We also need to look in to all options for cutting rent. That’s why we’re calling for a Living Rent Commission to tackle our housing crisis.” It is not the first time the Greens’ campaign plans have gone awry - the party twice had to postpone a poster launch while earlier this year Ms Bennett suffered a “brain fade” during a radio interview in which she struggled to explain her party’s policies.","SNP leader says she will hold talks with Westminster parties after May 8 .

"A filmmaker has revealed how he was pummeled with snow and ice for a minute and almost buried alive when the deadly avalanche hit Mount Everest on Saturday. Michael Churton from New York, was with four colleagues at the base camp, 17,500ft above sea level, when he was knocked down by the tsunami of snow. The 38-year-old believes that the force of the earthquake shook loose a big ice shelf, which careered down the mountainside towards him and a group of people he was with. Scroll down for video . Michael Churton from New York, was with four colleagues at the Mount Everest base camp, 17,500ft up, when he was knocked down by the tsunami of snow. He was knocked back and suffered facial injuries . Churton, 38, (right) from bids good-bye to fellow survivors Mariusz Malkowski from New Jersey (center) and Ron Nissien from Australia after their return to the domestic airport in Kathmandu, Nepal . Churton described how he told his group to get down just before the snow devastated the base camp (pictured) He said: 'I told the group to get down. It was about 4,000 feet of snow just coming and there was nowhere to run.' As the wall of snow approached, he got into the fetal position and hoped for the best. The force hitting his body knocked him into a rock, leaving him with some facial injuries. After the mountains of snow had passed, he managed to dig himself out and began searching for colleagues. He eventually made his way down from the mountain and was greeted by fellow survivors at a domestic airport in Kathmandu. At least 17 people who were on Mount Everest at the time have died while others are still unaccounted for. Other Americans who were on Mount Everest when it was hit by a deadly avalanche have described the moment the wall of snow and ice hit their camp and the carnage that surrounded them during the aftermath. Nick Cienski, from Baltimore, who is still at base camp told Good Morning America: ‘We're doing really well out here. We were really fortunate that we were hit by the edge of it. ‘It was terrifying. When we looked up and saw this thing coming... it was like out of a Hollywood movie, it was huge. ‘We hunkered down in our tents and just prayed... The whole tent was just moving in the wind. It was incredibly terrifying. We had no idea if we were going to be ripped off the ground and flung into rocks. ‘[Afterwards] We got out of our tents and realized we were largely OK. We immediately started looking for survivors. [Says they’re doing well] ‘We've got clean water. We've got good sanitation. We've got lots of food because we're planning to be here for a couple of months.' Scott Holder, a financial adviser from Santa Rosa, California, and Jon Reiter, a contractor from nearby Kenwood in Sonoma County, were caught up in the deadly avalanche. Reiter, who was making his third attempt at the summit, called is wife Susan by satellite phone, The Press Democrat reported. He described how he was given medicine to give to the injured, but one doctor told him: 'Don't worry, you are just comforting these people. Most of them are not going to survive.' Saying he had a 'pretty rough day' Saturday, he added during an interview with CNN that he was forced to zip a dead body into a sleeping bag. She then posted on his blog about what had happened. 'He said that the ground shook for a very long time and that avalanches were happening one right after another on the mountain, ' she wrote. 'We just talked for a minute and he got off the phone because he and his climbing partner Moises are helping with the rescue effort. Jon and Moises don't have medical training but they are acting as medics because so many people are injured. Jon Reiter, a contractor from Kenwood, California, was attempting his third ascent to the summit when the avalanche hit. He described how he tended for the injured even after doctors told him there is little chance they will survive . 'He said that most of base camp was damaged. All the IMG (International Mountain Guides) group tents are being used as temporary medical facilities for the injured. ' Jon also spoke to CNN on Sunday, saying: 'We're feeling pretty lucky today.' Holder managed to escape the carnage - having to leave the mountain with a severe head cold one day before the earthquake hit. He said: 'God definitely had his hand in my survival. My cold took me out of the danger zone. I guess you could say God gave me a cold.' Ashleigh Stumler from Charlotte, North Carolina, thought she was getting dizzy as she hiked on Mount Everest, but a guide soon informed her it was an earthquake. She told WSOC that she was forced to hang onto a tree as the earth shook. Ashleigh Stumler from Charlotte, North Carolina, thought she was getting dizzy as she hiked on Mount Everest, but a guide soon informed her it was an earthquake . As she makes her way down from the mountain, she is hoping to help survivors and is gathering contacts in the United States in a bid to raise funds. 'These have been some of the most incredible, strong people I've ever met in my entire life. Just good people and they are in dire need of help.' Melissa Arnot, who was set to be only the second woman to climb Everest without oxygen checked in via satellite phone to say her team was safe on Saturday. Among mountaineers thought to have died in the disaster is 33-year-old Google executive and a former medical student doctor offering care at the site while a filmmaker recording a documentary at the base camp was also killed. American Google executive Dan Fredinburg was the first confirmed fatality on the mountain yesterday. Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, was also killed when ice and rock crushed the 18,000-foot-altitude base camp where she worked as a medic for Madison Mountaineering. A third American, Tom Taplin, 61, who owned TET Films & Photography, was making a documentary when the earthquake hit, NBC News reported. His wife Corey Fryer told the station he died 'doing what he loved'. It is the worst natural disaster Nepal has seen in 81 years, and the highest death toll ever recorded on Everest. Before now, the mountain's deadliest year was 2014, when 16 people died in one day.

"Fans of the show might never see what’s going on – but a writer for The Archers has revealed that keeping a bed in the studio is essential for realistic sex scenes. Veteran scriptwriter for the Radio 4 drama, Keri Davies, said that having a divan to hand is vital to make post-coital conversations sound convincing. Speaking during an Afternoon Tea With The Archers event at the weekend, Mr Davies explained: ‘Sex is even harder, as it were. We do have a bed in the studio because your voice sounds different when you are lying down. A writer for The Archers has revealed that keeping a bed in the studio is essential for realistic sex scenes (file picture) ‘There will be a sound engineer in a Led Zeppelin T-shirt rattling the duvet!’ He added that parties in the fictional Ambridge are limited to nine attendees because of budgetary considerations. ‘Sometimes you will hear two people saying “oh we saw Barry the other day”, and that’s because we couldn’t afford Barry,’ he told the audience at Chipping Norton Literary Festival. ‘We can only have 39 actor bookings in a week, which is roughly six or seven in an episode. Sometimes if you have a big party you will have eight or nine, so it is up to us to decide with all of those restrictions how we are going to tell the tales.’ Actor Charles Collingwood, who joined the programme in 1975, also defended the show’s editor Sean O’Connor who has been criticised for ‘sexing up’ the traditional radio serial. He said Mr O’Connor ‘is bringing in really exciting stories’.

"The widow of US Navy SEAL Chris Kyle has revealed the painful moment she first broke the news to their two children that their father had been murdered. Taya Kyle told ABC's Robin Roberts she gathered her son, Colton and daughter, McKenna and prepared to tell them. 'I remembered just closing my eyes, the tears rolling down and me just trying to breathe,' said Kyle. Reveal: Taya Kyle had to do everything she could from falling apart in front of her kids when she explained to them their father had been killed . Recovery: Taya has given an interview to 20/20s Robin Roberts about her life since Eddie Ray Routh was convicted of killing her husband, American Sniper, Chris Kyle . Taya, 40, was speaking to Roberts for a special edition of ABC News' 20/20 which will air on Friday, May 1 and will catch up with the widow of Kyle, whose story is portrayed in the blockbuster movie, American Sniper. It will be the first in-depth interview that Kyle has given since former Marine Eddie Ray Routh was found guilty of capital murder on February 24 for shooting dead Chris Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield. He was automatically handed a life sentence without the possibility of parole and Taya Kyle broke down in tears on the stand when she gave evidence on the first day of the trial. During the course of their interview, Kyle jokes with Roberts that she never thought she would marry 'a cowboy' but was 'excited' by falling in love with him. 'I never probably thought a cowboy would want me,' she said. 'And I said I would never marry somebody -- a SEAL either. So… 'there you go with your plans again,' right?' Family: Chris Kyle (pictured unshaven) proudly poses with his son, Colton and daughter, Mckenna and wife Taya after leaving active service  in around 2012 . Taxing and emotional testimony: Taya Kyle wipes the tears from her eyes as she gives evidence from the stand during the trial of Chris Kyle's killer, Eddie Ray Routh in February . Eddie Ray Routh pleaded not guilty to killing Chris Kyle and said that he shot him and his friend Chad Littlefield dead because he was suffering PTSD. The jury decided he was guilty of murder and knew what he was doing . Taya has also written a new book, 'American Wife: A Memoir of Love, War, Faith and Renewal' which will go into detail about her marriage and the aftermath of Chris's death. The book is released on May 4 and Taya hopes it will draw a line under her recent events. In March, Taya published a heartbreaking letter to mark their 13th wedding anniversary. Taya Kyle pledged to love her late husband 'all the days of my life' in the touching tribute in which she described the moment her future husband gave her two dozen roses during one of their first dates. Kyle, who was the subject of last year's Clint Eastwood-directed movie American Sniper, was gunned down by fellow war veteran Eddie Ray Routh at a shooting range in Rough Creek, Texas, on February 2, 2013. Taya Kyle was the first witnesses called during the trial. The judge also allowed her to attend the public gallery afterwards to watch the trial . American Sniper: Eddie Ray Routh shot Chris Kyle dead in February of 2013. In February of 2015 he was found guilty for the death of the war hero . That day, Kyle had offered to help Routh deal with his post traumatic stress disorder but was instead shot dead along with his friend Chad Littlefield. Now, in the wake of a turbulent year that involved her husband's killer's trial and an appearance at the Academy Awards for the film made in his name, Mrs Kyle has written of her enduring love for her husband. Posted on Facebook in March, her letter said: 'I feel you in my heart and soul so strongly. I am more blessed to have been your wife than anything else in my life. 'Today, I am thinking of our new relationship, when you rented a boutique hotel room in San Diego and surprised me with two dozen long stem pink roses when we arrived. You got us tickets to a local improv type play. I knew then I was the luckiest girl in the world to be with tough, romantic, loving you. 'Today, I have a choice. I can bury myself under the covers and acknowledge the pain of missing you and mourn the future anniversaries without you. Or, I can celebrate never having a day without you in my heart because you loved me enough to leave me a lifetime of memories and beauty. 'I am somewhere in between today. I loved you yesterday, I love you know, and I will love you all the days of my life.' Kyle was considered the deadliest sniper in American history, with his kill count thought to number about 160 confirmed, with many more probable kills.","Taya Kyle, 40 remembers crying as she told her young son and daughter .

"Murderer: Ronald Jebson, who was responsible for the 'Babes in the Woods' killings, when first jailed in the 1970s, died of kidney failure almost a fortnight ago . A paedophile serial killer who murdered three children and sexually abused several more has died secretly in prison, it was revealed today. Ronald Jebson, who was responsible for the 'Babes in the Woods' murders in 1970, died of kidney failure almost a fortnight ago. Jebson's final wish was for his death to be secret and victims' families only found out after journalists told them 11 days after he died. Beryl Hanlon, whose 12-year-old son Gary was killed together with his 11-year-old friend Susan Blatchford in 1970, sobbed as she heard the news. Mrs Hanlon said: 'I'm glad to hear he's gone. I just don't want him to be able to hurt anyone else's children. 'I still have nightmares. I just can't sleep at night. I wake up crying sometimes I just can't understand how some people are so evil. 'I keep imagining what Jebson did to him'. Four years after killing the two friends Jebson strangled eight-year-old Rosemary Papper, shose sister Samantha Humbles, 45, said: 'He deserves to rot in hell' Jebson, who was being held at HMP Frankland, which also holds child killer Ian Huntley, died at the University Hospital of North Durham 11 days ago. A prison source told The Sun: 'He was bitter and twisted and did not want people to have the satisfaction and relief of knowing he was dead.' In 2000 he confessed his part in the deaths of Gary Hanlon, 12, and Susan Blatchford, 11, thirty years earlier, while serving a life sentence for strangling an eight-year-old girl. The murder of the pair in 1970 became known as the Babes in the Wood case because their bodies were dumped in a copse on the fringes of Epping Forest in Essex. Bereft: Beryl Hanlon, whose 12-year-old son Gary was murdered by Jebson said: 'I'm glad to hear he's gone. I just don't want him to be able to hurt anyone else's children' Crimes: In 2000 confessed his part in the deaths of friends Gary Hanlon, 12, and Susan Blatchford, 11, who he murdered and dumped on the edge of Epping Forest . Jebson finally confessed to police because he felt he could die shortly 'and did not want to go into his grave knowing the murder of the two young friends was still unsolved. He wanted to clear his conscience,' said Richard Whittham, prosecuting. But he refused to accompany police to the area where he had sexually abused and killed his victims because he feared the ghosts of the children would haunt the area. Serial killer: Jebson, pictured, had also strangled eight year old Rosemary Papper . Jebson admitted he had been evil over the years and was a danger to children. 'If I get a few drinks and poppers, nothing would stop me,' he had said. The Ministry of Justice is said to have made attempts to contact the families of the children murdered by Mr Jebson to inform them of his death. The government department said it does not discuss individual cases but a spokesman added: 'It is ridiculous to suggest prison staff would deliberately prevent deaths in custody being made public. 'Offenders do not decide whether victims' families are informed about their death.' Gary and Susan vanished from their homes in Enfield, North London, after Gary called for her and they left to go for a walk. They were last seen together strolling and laughing as they went across fields. Jebson, who had previous convictions for sexually assaulting children, told police he picked them up on March 1 and drove them to a spot where he shared cannabis with them. He then took them into a copse and sexually assaulted them. After killing them, he left them about a foot apart in a bird watcher's hide in the copse. Their bodies were found on June 17, 1970, covered in twigs. A cause of death could not be ascertained at the time and no-one was charged. Jebson kept his evil secret for decades. In 1974, he was sentenced to life at St Albans Crown Court for another paedophile murder of the eight-year-old daughter of a friend. Jebson had picked up Rosemary Papper from school, bought her sweets and raped her before strangling her with a piece of twine in a field in Hertfordshire. The judge recommended he should serve at least 20 years. Crime scene: The bodies of the two children were found here in this copse on the edge of Epping Forest but the crime remained unsolved for 30 years . It was not until 1996 that Jebson gave the first indication to a prison officer that he was responsible for the Babes in the Wood murders. It started a chain of events including the exhumation of Susan's grave in Ponders End, North London, which ended decades of uncertainty for the children's families. Jebson originally implicated two other people in their deaths. But, over four years, police broke down his story and he admitted sole responsibility. The nightmare began with two schoolfriends disappearing after going for a walk on a grey and blustery afternoon in 1970. Eleven weeks later the discovery of their bodies huddled together under a pile of leaves and twigs left the nation in shock. In 2000 three decades of anguish for the mothers of Susan Blatchford, 11, and Gary Hanlon, 12, came to an emotional close as paedophile Ronald Jebson, who was already in jail for another murder, finally admitted raping and strangling them. Hunt: The murders of Susan and Gary became one of Britain's most high profile unsolved murders until Jebson finally admitted he did it . Beryl Hanlon and Muriel Blatchford, who are both widowed, broke down in tears as 61-year-old Jebson was led away from the dock at the Old Bailey in the final act of what became-known as the Babes in the Wood mystery. The children fell victim to the perverted Jebson on that spring day 30 years ago after Susan knocked at Gary Hanlon's door at around 4pm on March 31 to ask if he wanted to go for a walk. Gary got his mum's permission to go out and, with his football under his arm, set off with Susan. They were seen an hour later walking across a field laughing together. It was the last time they were seen alive. In 2000 three decades of anguish for the mothers of Susan Blatchford, 11, pictured, and Gary Hanlon, 12, came to an emotional close as paedophile . Their parents reported them missing and a massive hunt was launched. Day after day, more than 600 police officers were joined by members of the public. Frogmen and teams of sniffer dogs were brought in but the friends appeared to have vanished. Nearly three months later, on June 17, a man walking his dog discovered the children's bodies in a copse in Epping Forest, Essex, 30 minutes walk from their home. As a stunned Britain struggled to absorb the news, post mortem tests failed to discover how they died. Time and again the question was posed of how two healthy, sensible young children could meet their deaths in such inexplicable circumstances. Their parents were convinced they had been murdered. Police agreed and launched an investigation under the leadership of Detective Chief Superintendent Leonard 'Nipper' Read, the man who nailed the Krays. During the inquiry 14,272 people were interviewed, but no one was brought to justice. It was the only murder 'Nipper' Read failed to solve during his long career. It left the Babes in the Wood one of the most intriguing and tragic unsolved mysteries in a generation. Jebson's confession finally vindicated the families' belief that Susan and Gary were murdered. He lived in lodgings in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, at the time, said he randomly selected his victims as he drove home after visiting an employment office in Enfield. High on drink and drugs, he took them to a field where he raped Susan. When Gary told him he wanted to go home, he told him: 'You're not going anywhere.' He then beat and raped him, before strangling both children and keeping Susan's tights, bra and knickers as 'trophies'. Today, describing that day, Beryl Hanlon said: 'You could always hear his football when he was kicking it around. 'I realise I couldn't hear him playing football and I looked out of the widow and he was gone.' She added: 'In the 1970s no-one knew about paedophiles. We were just told about dirty old men. 'All the children used to play together on the estate. We all thought of it as such a safe place.'","Triple killer Ronald Jebson died of kidney failure almost a fortnight ago .

The previous so-called King of Instagram, poker player Dan Bilzerian, has never been far from controversy since his rise to online fame. He was recently forced into making a public safety announcement in order to avoid jail after being arrested for placing homemade explosives inside a tractor before shooting them.

And at the end of last year he found himself on the end of a lawsuit after model Vanessa Castano claimed he kicked her in the face in a nightclub.

She had tried to claim money for shoots she could not attend following the accident. Bilzerian fought back, claiming the model grabbed at his t-shirt at the last second, nearly dragging him off the roof with her. The charges were eventually dropped. Bilzerian is reportedly worth $100 million, making the bulk of his cash as a high-stakes gambler after developing his skills as a student at the University of South Florida.

"A Wyoming State Penitentiary inmate has pleaded guilty to trying — from behind bars — to hire a hit man to kill his mother and stepfather so he could collect life insurance money and inherit their house. Andrew Silicani, 23, of Cheyenne pleaded guilty on Monday in federal court to four counts of using the mail in his unsuccessful plan to hire someone to carry out the murders. He faces up to 40 years at sentencing this summer. 'I think it's fair to say you'll be looking at some time in custody,' U.S. District Judge Nancy Freudenthal told Silicani as she advised him of his rights. Andrew Silicani, 23, of Cheyenne, Wyoming, pleaded guilty on Monday to trying — from behind bars — to hire a hit man to kill his mother and stepfather so he could inherit their house . Silicani pleaded guilty to all charges against him with no agreement from prosecutors to recommend a lesser sentence. Defense lawyer James Barrett told Freudenthal that Silicani had rejected a plea offer from federal prosecutors that would have capped his prison time at 35 years and blocked the possibility that state prosecutors will seek to charge him with separate violations of state law. Speaking after the hearing, Barrett said he thinks it's likely that Silicani will face additional state prosecution. Barrett said Silicani's decision to reject the federal plea offer reflected Silicani's view that a 35-year federal sentence would be excessive. Recounting his actions to support his guilty pleas, Silicani told Freudenthal, 'I used the mail, wrote four letters asking for this to be done — for the murders of my mom and stepdad. I understand what I've done. I felt that pleading guilty would be best.' Silicani told the judge he regarded his actions as 'a big error in judgment — I'd take it back if I could.' Silicani was serving a five- to seven-year sentence at the state prison in Rawlins for conspiracy to commit robbery and robbery resulting in bodily injury, according to the Department of Corrections. He was sentenced in April 2012. According to an FBI agent's statement filed in court, a confidential source contacted prison staff in November and reported that Silicani had asked if the source would be willing to kill Silicani's mother and stepfather. Investigators had the source direct Silicani to correspond with an FBI agent posing as a hit man. Silicani provided the supposed hit man with the names and address of his parents and said he didn't want to pay more than $100,000 for the 'demolition work.' Court records said Silicani expected to receive $850,000 in life insurance and property. The confidential source told law enforcement that Silicani was excited at the prospect of the murders and said he planned to buy, 'a Cadillac Escalade, clothes and jewelry.'","Andrew Silicani, 23, of Cheyenne, Wyoming, pleaded guilty on Monday to trying to hire a hit man to kill his mother and stepfather .

"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met Monday for the first time since world powers and Iran sealed a framework agreement on April 2 that would limit Iran's ability to build a nuclear weapon. They now have little more than two months to meet their own deadline of June 30 to sign a comprehensive accord, which hinges on both sides coming to an agreement on the timing of sanctions relief. The Obama administration moved on two fronts today to advance its nuclear diplomacy with Iran, with talks between top U.S. and Iranian diplomats at a United Nations conference in New York and an aggressive effort to sell the emerging deal to skeptical American lawmakers and constituencies in Washington. In this March 16 photo, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, listens to Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, right, during diplomatic talks about Iran's nuclear program in Lausanne, Switzerland. Kerry and Zarif met today at the United Nations on the sidelines of a conference on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in which both men are participating for the first time since a framework agreement was reached earlier this month . Kerry and Zarif reconvened at the Upper East Side home of Iran's ambassador to the United Nations today after their marathon negotiations in Switzerland with several questions outstanding. Kerry is pictured here today giving remarks at the U.N. nuclear proliferation conference in New York . In the nation's capitol, lead U.S. negotiator Wendy Sherman told a conference of reform Jews that diplomatic collapse would leave Iran perilously close to nuclear weapons capacity. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said a final agreement would in some ways be tougher than what the U.S. has outlined thus far. All the activity was taking place as the Senate begins debate over empowering Congress to review and possibly reject any nuclear pact. Republican presidential candidates are lining up to oppose any deal with a government the U.S. considers the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and to show their support for Israel. Marco Rubio of Florida wants to require Iran's leaders to publicly accept Israel's right to exist, a nearly impossible mandate. Ted Cruz of Texas hopes to put the onus on advocates to win congressional approval of a deal, and not on opponents to gather enough votes for rejection. But even as the legislation moves forward, House Speaker John Boehner privately acknowledged to a gathering of the Republican Jewish Coalition over the weekend that his party doesn't command enough votes to override a presidential veto of any resolution disapproving of an Iran deal, BloombergView reported. Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, didn't dispute the report. 'Obviously, it takes only a fraction of the House and Senate Democrats to sustain a veto, but it is impossible to say whether they will or not until we know what the final 'deal' looks like,' Steel told the Associated Press. President Barack Obama is pictured here showing Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall today. His administration moved on two fronts today to advance its nuclear diplomacy with Iran, with talks between top U.S. and Iranian diplomats at the United Nations conference in New York and an aggressive effort to sell the emerging deal to skeptical American lawmakers and constituencies in Washington . Prime Minister Abe is in the nation's Capital to discuss a range of economic, security, and global issues, including progress on the Trans Pacific Partnership, Japan's expanding role in the Alliance, and climate change. The two national leaders are pictured here from behind, still at the Lincoln Memorial, facing the Washington Monument . Kerry and Zarif reconvened at the Upper East Side home of Iran's ambassador to the United Nations today after their marathon negotiations in Switzerland with several questions outstanding. Particularly problematic for President Barack Obama and his team are how quickly sanctions would be eased for Tehran in exchange for nuclear concessions, and how to snap economic restrictions back into place quickly if Iran is caught cheating. At a breakfast meeting with journalists, Moniz, a former MIT physics department head, provided some new detail on the combination of technical limits that the U.S. says would keep Iran at least a year away from assembling enough fissile material for one nuclear weapon for at least a decade. Hours after the framework was announced, the U.S. said Iran would be permitted to keep 6,104 centrifuges installed. Of these, a little more than 1,000 could be kept at Iran's deeply buried facility at Fordo that may be impervious to U.S. or Israeli air attack. None of those would be permitted to enrich uranium, material that can be used in a nuclear warhead. Moniz said no advanced centrifuges can be installed or developed at that site for 15 years. And in a new twist, he said only one-third of the 1,000 centrifuges there can actually 'spin' over that period. The rest will be 'just sitting there,' he said. The details are significant because they provide another piece of how American officials calculate that they'd have enough time to detect any Iranian push toward a bomb and respond. Tehran says its program is solely designed for energy, medical and research purposes, but Washington and many other governments distrust Iran's motives. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, center, and the committee's ranking member Ben Cardin, are seen here speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington on the day their bill empowering Congress to review and potentially reject any Iran nuclear deal won approval of the panel. They must now win a battle in the full Senate with some colleagues determined to change the legislation in ways that could sink it . Nowhere does skepticism seem higher than on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are wrestling with how tough to make legislation on Iran that has gained the tacit approval of Obama. Proponents of the bill are trying to discourage any changes to the legislation. They recognize that politically driven amendments could undermine Democratic support and sink the carefully crafted measure. 'Anybody who monkeys with this bill is going to run into a buzz saw,' Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a possible White House candidate, warned ahead of this week's debate. Sherman, the State Department's undersecretary for political affairs, said if talks fail to produce a final deal, Iran would be two to three months from being able to produce enough material for a weapon. Speaking to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism in Washington, she said the president would reconsider support for the bill if it is distorted by amendments. 'There will be a lot of pretty awful amendments, quite frankly, and we'll see where we end up,' Sherman said. The bill was approved 19-0 by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It has 62 co-sponsors from both parties. The legislation would block Obama from waiving congressional sanctions for at least 30 days while lawmakers weigh in. And it would stipulate that if senators disapprove the deal, Obama would lose authority to waive certain economic penalties — an event that would certainly prompt a presidential veto. Among proposed additions to the bill are demands that Iran release any U.S. citizens it is holding and refrain from any cooperation with nuclear-armed North Korea. Another insists that any agreement be treated as an international treaty, requiring two-thirds ratification by the Senate. Another set of amendments would block any sanctions relief for Iran until it meets goals the U.S. set years ago as negotiating stances and has long since abandoned. The bill must receive 66 votes in the Senate .","It was their first meeting since world powers and Iran sealed a framework deal on April 2 that would limit Iran's ability to build a nuclear weapon .

"It had all the trappings of a down-home country fair somewhere well below the Mason-Dixon line: Lynyrd Skynyrd medleys, mile-long lines for fried chicken, barbecue and draft beer, and a plethora of Confederate flags emblazoning everything from belt buckles to motorcycle vests to trucker caps. But Sunday's party marking the 150th anniversary of the end of the American Civil War took about 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometers) south of the South, in a rural Brazilian town colonized by families fleeing Reconstruction. For many of the residents of Santa Barbara d'Oeste and neighboring Americana in Brazil's southeastern Sao Paulo state, having Confederate ancestry is a point of pride that's celebrated in high style at the annual 'Festa dos Confederados,' or 'Confederates Party' in Portuguese. Proud heritage: Descendants of American Southerners wearing Confederate-era uniforms pose for pictures as they attend a party to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the end of the American Civil War in Santa Barbara d'Oeste, Brazil on Sunday . Thousands turn out every year, including many who trace their ancestry back to the dozens of families who, enticed by the Brazilian government's offers of land grants, settled here from 1865 to around 1875. They're joined by country music enthusiasts, history buffs and locals with a hankering for buttermilk biscuits or a fondness for 'The Dukes of Hazzard.' 'I don't speak English and the only place I've been to in the U.S. is Disneyworld, but I feel the heritage,' said 77-year-old Alcina Tanner Coltre, whose great-great-grandparents migrated from Mississippi along with their 15-year-old son. 'My great-grandfather married a Brazilian woman, so he integrated into Brazilian culture pretty quickly, but it's really important to me to come out every year to remember where we come from.' The party takes place up a dusty dirt road flanked on both sides by sugarcane plantations, in a field that abuts on the 'Cemiterio dos Americanos,' or 'American Cemetery,' which began as the resting place of the wife and two daughters of one of the first Confederados and still serves their descendants today. Amid food and beer stands bedecked with red-white-and-blue ribbons, extended families tucked into diet-busting barbecue and hamburger lunches as 'Dixie' played on a loop. Teenage girls pulled hoop skirts over their cut-off short-shorts and wiggled into bustier tops, taking to the stage painted with a giant Confederate flag on the arms of young men in grey and yellow Johnny Reb uniforms. The pairs solemnly presented the flags of the 13 Confederate states and square danced to raucous fiddle music. But for the abundance of glitter eye shadow and the modern tattoos peeking out from beneath the uniforms, the stage had a convincing 'Gone With the Wind' vibe. American visitors Rex and Gwen Gray, Civil War buffs who made the trip to Brazil from their home in Tucumcari, New Mexico, were sold. 'It feels really authentic,' gushed Gwen Gray, a 69-year-old retiree originally from Greeneville, Tennessee, explaining that she first read about the Confederados on a Facebook posting a few months ago. 'It piqued my interest because I've read a lot about the history of the Civil War and I'd never heard about them and neither had anyone else I know. So we were real curious to see for ourselves.' Descendants of American Southerners Philip Logan and his wife Eloiza Logan, pose for pictures during the Festa dos Confederados where thousands turn out every year, including many of those who trace their ancestry back to the dozens of families who left Dixie for points far south between 1865 to around 1875 .

Point of pride: For many of the residents of Santa Barbara d'Oeste and neighboring Americana, in Brazil's southeastern Sao Paulo state, having Confederate ancestry is a point of pride and is celebrated in high style at the annual Festa dos Confederados, or Confederates Party in Portuguese . The American South became an unfamiliar place, in some respects, to many Sons of Dixie during Reconstruction. In those years following the Civil War, many northerners flowed south of the Mason-Dixon in search of economic gain. These so-called 'carpetbaggers' were seen as opportunistic by many poor southerners who believed they were being used and their land stolen with the help of northern capital. Also seen as the enemy to some Confederate loyalists in the postbellum South were the scalawags. These were the Southerners who saw more of an advantage in backing the Yankee policies governing the reconstruction than in opposing them in favor of the throwback policies of the old gaurd. Many of them supported giving rights to African Americans and supported the influx of northern investors. As they watched Dixie change during the federal occupation--and watched the emancipation of black slaves--some Southerners chose to leave. Many fled west. A select few were enticed into settling the wild interiors of South America by the Brazilian government. Most were lured by newspaper ads placed in the wake of the war by the government of Brazil's then-emperor, Dom Pedro II, promising land grants to those who would help colonize the South American country's vast and little-explored interior. It's not even known for sure how many people made the arduous journey. Some historical accounts suggesting as few as 3,000, while others say there were as many as 10,000, predominantly from deep south states like Alabama, Louisiana and Georgia. The fact that slavery was still legal in Brazil, where it was outlawed only in 1888, may also have been a factor, though Clabough said it was doubtful many of the Confederados would have been able to afford slaves either in the U.S. or in Brazil. The history of the Confederate migrants is one of the lesser-known stories of the Civil War, said Casey Clabough, author of the 2012 historical novel 'Confederados.' It's not even known for sure how many people made the arduous journey, Clabough said, with some historical accounts suggesting as few as 3,000, while others say there were as many as 10,000, predominantly from deep south states like Alabama, Louisiana and Georgia. Most were lured by newspaper ads placed in the wake of the war by the government of Brazil's then-emperor, Dom Pedro II, promising land grants to those who would help colonize the South American country's vast and little-explored interior. 'They were seen as desirable, educated colonists,' said Clabough, adding the Confederados introduced the bull-tongue plow and other agricultural innovations to Brazil. 'And from the point of view of American Southerners who had just gone through this catastrophic conflict and were looking toward an uncertain reconstruction period, it certainly seemed attractive.' The fact that slavery was still legal in Brazil, where it was outlawed only in 1888, may also have been a factor, though Clabough said it was doubtful many of the Confederados would have been able to afford slaves either in the U.S. or in Brazil. Legend has it that Dom Pedro himself was on hand at Rio's port to greet the first batch of Confederados, mostly enlisted men and small family farmers who were then dispatched to rural areas of the surrounding states. Difficult conditions in Brazil swiftly took their toll. Many succumbed to tropical diseases, while others were felled by sheer exhaustion. About half gave up and returned to the U.S., said Clabough. Those who stayed ended up assimilating into Brazilian society, and very few of the Confederados' descendants speak English today. Some are racially mixed — as is common in this majority Black and multiracial nation. Mixed-race guests at Sunday's party seemed unruffled by the omnipresent Confederate flag. 'To me it's a positive symbol of my heritage,' said Keila Padovese Armelin, a 40-year-old mother of two who describes herself as a 'racial milkshake.'

"Britons heading to Europe on holiday are facing the nightmare of arriving at their destination and not being able to hire a car, thanks to a controversial driving licence shake-up. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is scrapping the paper counterpart that accompanies all UK plastic photocard licences. Information about penalty points for traffic violations such as speeding will be held only on the DVLA’s database, and will have to be checked online, by phone or by post. But motoring groups fear the switch to a fully online system will make it more difficult for car hire firms which want to check a motorist’s details. Scroll down for video . Changes: Britons heading to Europe on holiday are facing the nightmare of arriving at their destination and not being able to hire a car, thanks to a controversial driving licence (file picture) shake-up . Concerns: Motoring groups fear the switch to a fully online system will make it more difficult for car hire firms which want to check a motorist’s details . From June 8, holidaymakers heading abroad will have to log on to the DVLA website the day before and put in their driving licence number to obtain a special code to give to their car hire company when they arrive at the desk. But fears are growing that the ‘muddled’ introduction of the new rules will mean people could be turned away because many car hire firms abroad will still insist on examining the paper document to check for endorsements or bans. Furthermore, the passcode is valid for only 72 hours, meaning anyone hiring a car in the second week of their trip faces having to find an internet cafe or pay expensive roaming charges. Mark Bower, of the car hire insurance website MoneyMaxim, said holidaymakers could endure major problems at car hire desks across Europe. He added: ‘Most people are simply unaware that these changes are on the way – and it is not just renters. ‘I spoke to one big car hire firm in Portugal this week and they knew nothing of the changes. Six weeks away from implementation, the whole thing is very muddled. ‘It is another thing you have to remember to do just before departure. Or you can do it at the desk with your smartphone if you can remember the website address, don’t mind the data roaming charges, can remember your national insurance number and are impervious to the long queue developing behind you.’ The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is scrapping the paper counterpart that accompanies all UK plastic photocard licences (file picture) Mr Bower also said unscrupulous firms might use the issue as ‘another excuse’ to persuade people to pay for extra insurance. Motorists will also be able to download their driving history as a printable PDF file, although it is unclear whether all car hire firms will accept that, or how drivers without access to a computer will cope. The DVLA insists the changes have been widely publicised. But consumers booking car hire for holidays after June have not been warned the new rules are being introduced. The terms and conditions of most car hire firms still explicitly state that paper counterparts must be produced. The British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association, which represents the industry, says UK hirers unaware of the rule change will be treated in the same way as those who currently turn up without both parts of the licence. The DVLA said the system, called Share Driving Licence, would be ready in time for June 8. A spokesman said: ‘There is up-to-date information on the website and we are working closely with the industry to ensure that their systems and processes are ready for the changes.’ The two-part licence was introduced in 1998 but many drivers found it inconvenient. From June 8, paper counterparts will be invalid and should be destroyed. Motorists with old-style paper driving licences from before 1998 can continue to use them.","Britons finding they cannot pick up hire cars after driving licence change .

"A 'perfectionist' straight A student who was stressed about her studies was killed by a speeding train, a coroner heard today. Chandni Nigam, 19, spent six years battling demons which spawned from an obsession to do well at school, an inquest into her death was told. Miss Nigam would stay up late studying, resulting in sleep deprivation and a negative impact on her performance at school - which caused further depression and anxiety. Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford heard the teenager, who had been a volunteer at the London Olympics in 2012, was also worried about her appearance. An inquest heard Chandni Nigam, 19, spent six years battling demons which spawned from an obsession to do well at school. Stock photo . Tragically, she had first told her parents she was feeling suicidal in 2013 and had even said she would stand in front of a fast train on a Tuesday to take her life - which is how she ultimately died. Miss Nigam had seen a number of doctors over several years, but her father Ankush Nigam told the inquest that she had often refused treatment. He explained that he felt he was 'torturing' his daughter by making her attend appointments - and eventually accepted that she would one day take her life. On February last year, the teenager was struck by a train travelling from London Paddington to Hereford at Twyford railway station in Berkshire. In a statement to the court, train driver Stephen Wood said he saw a pair of legs running into his view from the right as he approached the station. Mr Wood said: 'I saw a person turn towards me and spread their arms wide apart. The train struck this person.' The driver had applied the emergency brake and paramedics were called to the scene, but Miss Nigam, from Lower Earley, Berkshire, died instantly from multiple injuries. Mr Nigam said: 'I'm glad she's in a peaceful place.' He said his daughter first started showing signs of depression and sleep deprivation at 13 and had been on various medication since. The teenager was struck by a train in February last year at Twyford railway station (pictured) in Berkshire . Her doctors had believed she showed improvement when on medication, but she was often reluctant to take it. And Mr Nigam criticised doctors for not believing him and his wife when she said their daughter's condition was worse than she presented to medics. She told doctors she did not want medication for her condition and was not judged to be a suicide risk. But Mr Nigam said his concerns were not taken seriously, even when he explained she had told her parents how she would kill herself in October 2013. He said his daughter had said she knew the times of fast trains and that it would be on a Tuesday. 'That was the first time she made a comment in respect of the train,' he said. 'She clicked her fingers and said it would be instantaneous, so don't worry.' The inquest heard she told doctors she did not want medication for her condition and was not judged to be a suicide risk. Mr Nigam said he began to accept there was nothing that could be done to help his daughter. He said: 'Nobody was willing to accept our version of events. What she said was given so much significance while what we said was ignored. 'I thought I might as well just let her go. I was waiting for something like this to happen. I literally felt like a passenger. 'I wish I had not subjected her to any of those doctors or anybody now. All I have done is added to her misery.' He added that every time he dropped his daughter off at a train station, he feared it would be the last time he saw her. He believes his daughter eventually took her life because she feared she would be put back on medication. The inquest heard Miss Nigam had suffered from a number of conditions in addition to depression, including acne, malnutrition, hair loss and itchy skin. She had achieved all A and A* grades at GCSE level, but was in and out of school and college as she battled her illness. The inquest continues.

"A loving boyfriend has granted his girlfriend her birthday wish of having their wedding photographs taken - even though they can't officially get married yet because she is bedridden in hospital. Guo Kai and girlfriend Dong Hui, who turned 22 on Monday, had been planning to get married this month in Sichuan in southwest China. But Dong was suddenly diagnosed with serious bone cancer and admitted to hospital, meaning a formal ceremony had to be postponed, reported the People's Daily Online.

After medical staff removed her catheter, her friends showed Dong three wedding dresses to choose from. She chose one with embroidered flowers and had her make-up done, before her husband-to-be handed her a bouquet of red roses. As they posed together, Dong whispered to her partner: 'To have you at my side is so important for me'. Since she has been admitted to hospital, Guo - who is now a firefighter - has constantly been at her bedside to attend to her every need.

"Flower pattern: Miriam González Durántez wore a particularly colourful ensemble to a fashion show and award gala in central London tonight . Miriam González Durántez is not one to blend into the background. She is known for her bold choices and this exotic look was no exception. The lawyer, wife of the Deputy Prime Minister and mother of three boys, wore a particularly colourful ensemble to a fashion show and award gala in central London tonight. Her bright pink, long-sleeved dress was covered in bright blooms at the LDNY fashion show and WIE (Women: Inspiration and Enterprise) award gala at Goldsmiths' Hall celebrating inspirational women and ethical fashion. As if the flower pattern was not enough of a nod to spring, a yellow and pink corsage was pinned to her shoulder. And despite the spring blossoms across the country, this was one of fake flowers.

She was pictured tonight with the likes of model Daisy Lowe, designer Kelly Hoppen and Bafta chief executive Amanda Berry. According to The Daily Telegraph, she told an audience: 'Political advisers prefer us to stick to safer ground like kitchens and children. But I much prefer risky ground to political advisers.' And in an article for the Huffington Post written before tonight's event, Miss González Durántez said: 'No matter your age, your skills or your background, every woman has an inner role model and it is the duty of every woman of my generation to stand up for young girls.' She added: 'I decided to support the WIE network (and yes, I am doing this in the middle of a General Election - and no, it is not an oversight).' At the service of thanksgiving for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012 the lawyer opted for a pillar-box red dress, with a fabric corsage on the neckline - in contrast to the more sombre colours surrounding her.

"The wife of a man jailed for killing his own brother has vowed to stand by her man. Mark Lowe, 32, from Skelmersdale, Lancashire, is currently serving a five-year sentence for beating and kicking his brother Wayne to death, after Wayne, then 33, attacked him in his bed with a knife. Mark's wife Sarah is now looking after three young children alone and said: '[Mark] will regret what he did for the rest of his life, because he loved his brother.' Mark Lowe, 32 (left), is currently serving a five year sentence for beating and kicking his brother Wayne (right) to death, but his wife Sarah (bottom) is standing by her man . Mark appeared before Liverpool Crown Court Court earlier this year. The court heard that Mark had killed his brother after Wayne tried to stab him during a drink-fuelled day of fighting at his mum's house on September 7 last year. Mark then kicked Wayne, 33, to death and was charged with his murder. But prosecutors accepted a manslaughter plea 'on the basis of a loss of control' as he was first attacked by a knife-wielding Wayne. Mark pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was last month jailed for five years. Sarah said: 'What Mark did was wrong. Wayne's death has shattered our whole family. Mark's wife (left) is now looking after three young children alone, including Jaiden, one, (center) and said, 'Mark (right) will regret what he did for the rest of his life, because he loved his brother' Mark killed his brother Wayne (pictured) after he tried to stab him during a drink-fuelled day of fighting at his mum's house on September 7 last year . Mark and Wayne, pictured as children, were said to be close, but Wayne had a dangerous temper and it was usually Mark who would 'calm him down' and act as peacemaker . 'Of the two brothers, Mark was always the peacemaker, stepping in to calm Wayne down. I always feared that Wayne would be the one to hurt him - not the other way round. 'It was said in court that Wayne had even attacked his own mother. He was well-known to the police and he had attacked officers too. 'But on that occasion, for the first time, Mark fought back, and he snapped. But I have to stand by him. Mark is a nurse and a good man and a loving father.' Mark and Sarah, both mental health nurses, met in 2004, working in a nursing home. Sarah said: 'We were both seeing other people but there was a spark between us that we couldn't ignore. 'Mark was a big football fan, a real man's man, but he had a heart of gold and was very compassionate. 'My dad was ill with cancer, and Mark and I both looked after him until he died. 'My mum had died a couple of years earlier and so I had hardly any family left. Instead, I became a part of Mark's family. Sarah describes her husband (pictured) as being a loving father to their three children, Jessica, now seven (right), Jocelyn, now three (centre) and one-year-old Jaiden (left) Mark and Sarah, pictured with two of their children, are both mental health nurses who met in 2004 while working in a nursing home . 'I got on well with his brother, Wayne, and his mum, Jillian and step-dad, Kenny. Mark and Wayne were very close but completely different. 'Mark was caring and compassionate and very academic. He trained as a nurse. He was also a keen runner and played the cornet in an orchestra. 'Wayne was a hot-head, in and out of work as a painter and decorator and often in fights. They had a lot of run-ins and Mark was frightened of him sometimes.' Sarah and Mark were married in October 2006 and went on to have three children, Jessica, now seven, Jocelyn, now three and one-year-old Jaiden. As they settled down to family life, Sarah often witnessed Wayne's erratic and aggressive behaviour. Sarah said: 'Wayne was a troubled soul; he got into trouble, often fighting when he was drinking too much. 'There were occasions when he was violent to their mum, Jill, and Mark had to go round to calm him down. 'Mark was the peacemaker whenever Wayne flew into a temper. Mark had mental health training, which helped, but they also had a bond as brothers.' Wayne (left) was described by the prosecution as 'a violent woman-beater well-known to the police' and once attacked his mum (right), leaving her with broken ribs . Sarah and Mark were married in October 2006 (pictured), and as they settled down to family life, Sarah often witnessed Wayne's erratic and aggressive behaviour . Wayne received professional help for his behaviour but his problems continued. Sarah said: 'When he wasn't drinking, he was a very charming, charismatic man, and we got on well. But I was wary of his temper. 'Mark was too soft and would always give him a second chance, which caused rows between us. But I thought Wayne was dangerous.' In September 2014, Sarah and Mark rowed and he went to stay overnight with his mum. Sarah said: 'I spoke to Mark in the evening, and we had both calmed down by then. He said be would home very early in the morning to take Jessica to school for her first day in the juniors.' But at midnight, Sarah was awoken by police at her door to tell her that Wayne was dead. Hours later, Mark called her to say he had been arrested for murdering his brother. Sarah said: 'That whole night was like a dream. It didn't seem real. Mark was very shaken when he called me, but he was adamant, from the start, that he didn't mean to hurt him and I knew that was true. 'I was devastated. I had always feared that Wayne might hurt Mark - not the other way round. I supported Mark completely.' Mark (left) had no previous convictions and said he and his family were bullied by his brother all his life. Pictured (right) Sarah with Jaiden . At the trial, the judge said Mark (pictured) was remorseful and 'genuinely devastated' by the death of his brother and what he had done to his family . At first, Sarah was supported by Mark's mum, but after he was charged with murder, they became distant. She said: 'I felt as though they were blaming me. And it went round and round my head, that if I hadn't rowed with Mark, he wouldn't have gone to his mum's and Wayne would still be alive. 'Our lives were in turmoil. Our three children missed their dad so much. 'Mark had never been in trouble before in his life, so to be sent away on remand was horrific for him. He was terrified.' John McDermott, prosecuting, said: 'The killing of Wayne Lowe was the final act in a day of arguments and fighting between the brothers, who when sober seemed to get on together, but when in drink were both prone to bad behaviour, according to their mother.' Mr McDermott said Wayne was a violent woman-beater 'well-known to the police' and once attacked his mum, leaving her with broken ribs. He had also head-butted a police officer and was described by his mother as 'a man who would fight to the end'. Mark had no previous convictions and said he and his family were bullied by his brother all his life. He said he suffered traumatic amnesia and did not remember the final moments, but had gone to sleep only to wake with a 'completely mad' Wayne lashing at him with a knife. Sarah, who is raising thier children alone, said, 'I had always feared that Wayne might hurt Mark - not the other way round. I supported Mark completely' Arthur Gibson, defending, said it was a tragedy sparked by Wayne, 'a Jekyll and Hyde character' who when drunk 'would pick an argument and fight even his friends'. Mr Gibson said the injuries Wayne suffered in the first fight were 'lawfully inflicted' and Mark had tried to avoid more violence. He said Mark had defended himself in the second fight, but when his brother presented no further threat, 'lost control'. Mr Gibson said: 'He accepts he must have struck and kicked his brother a considerable number of times, when his brother was unable to defend himself.' But he added: 'The trigger here is a man asleep in bed, being attacked by another man with a knife. 'It is difficult to see how there could be a greater degree of provocation.' Mr Justice King said Mark unleashed a 'frenzied' attack on his brother and said it was not true that he had acted only in self-defence and bore no responsibility. Jailing him for four years and eight months, the judge said Mark was remorseful and 'genuinely devastated' by the death of his brother and what he had done to his family. Sarah has now started a support group for Mark, which has 150 members.","Mark Lowe, 32, beat his brother Wayne, 33, to death last September .

"A property tycoon has admitted damaging the historic mansion house which inspired one of Britain's best-loved hymns by giving it a gaudy makeover. Kim Davies bought the Elizabethan manor in rural Wales where Cecil Frances Alexander wrote the lyrics to All Things Bright and Beautiful. But he then made dozens of illegal alterations, including installing a whirlpool bath with shiny mosaic tiles, crystal chandeliers and spotlights in the ceiling. Alterations: Kim Davies has admitted illegally altering Llanwenarth House by installing chandeliers and other gaudy modern touches . Bedroom: The master suite at Llanwenarth House, which is where Cecil Frances Alexander wrote All Things Bright and Beautiful . Glitzy: Davies installed a shiny mosaic bath in the house, and has now admitted breaking planning laws . He also put in inappropriate kitchen fittings and replaced the Grade II-listed house's timber windows with modern ones. Davies, 60, initially denied five charges under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. However, shortly before his trial was scheduled to start at Newport Crown Court he pleaded guilty to illegally altering Llanwenarth House, near Abergavenny in Monmouthshire. Davies' lawyer George Carter-Stephenson QC said: 'My client accepts that he has got himself into a very difficult position by fighting this case. 'He now has accepted legal advice and has pleaded guilty to these offences and needs to do something positive to restore the house to the way it should be. He wants to put right what he has wrongly done to the house.' Guilty: Davies, left, has changed his plea over the home where Mrs Alexander, right, once stayed as a guest . Historic: The Tudor house in the Brecon Beacons was bought for £657,000 in 2006 but later went on the market for £2.25million . Modern: Davies ripped out the old kitchen and replaced it with one in a more fashionable style . Punishment: Davies could face a prison sentence for illegally altering the Tudor manor house, one of whose bedrooms is pictured . Davies also admitted offences relating to the property's Coach House and its courtyard - such as tearing up old cobblestones and putting down new flagstone paving. The home was built in the late 16th century and was first listed in 1956 because of its national importance. Mrs Alexander - who also wrote Once in Royal David's City - was staying there in 1848 when she penned her hymn of praise to the natural world and God's role in creating it. The 'purple headed mountain' in one verse of the song supposedly refers to the nearby Sugar Loaf and Blorenge peaks while the 'river running by' is the River Usk, which flows close to the estate's boundary. Restrictions: Planners prosecuted Davies when they saw the renovations, which cost more than £1million . Wood-panelled: But a string of more modern alterations have now led Davies into legal trouble . Flashy: Another view of the kitchen, which now looks more fitting for a mega-mansion in Los Angeles or Florida . Ornate: The wooden staircase leading to the luxurious and bejewelled bathroom at Llanwenarth House . Llanwenarth was owned for centuries by the famous Morgan family, ancestors of the navy admiral and privateer Sir Henry Morgan. Davies bought the house - described as an 'historical gem' - for £675,000 in 2008, and has spent more than £1million on renovating it over the past few years. In 2012, the house was listed for sale with a £2.25million price tag but it was not sold. Davies always admitted installing a new kitchen and bathrooms, but claimed the work falls outside the restrictions on listed buildings. The house is in the Brecon Beacons National Park and planning officials picked up on the alterations. Liquor storage: The kitchen now has a wine rack built in to the central 'island' so its owner does not have to travel for a drink . Sumptuous: The four-poster bed in yet another bedroom, which is also kitted out with a shagpile carpet . Marble: The smaller bathroom has expensive counters and a window sill made of luxury stone . One villager said: 'From the photographs, the inside looks like a footballer's wife monstrosity. 'This isn't the first time some lovely country house with loads of history have been modernised out of all context. 'The upstairs rooms appear to have retained some character but the kitchen, living rooms and bathrooms appear completely out of keeping.' Davies will be sentenced next month. Penalties for changing a Grade II-listed Building without permission include a maximum 12-month prison sentence or an unlimited fine. Cecil Frances Alexander was a prolific writer of more than 400 poems, and several of them have become hymns which are famous across the world, including 'All Things Bright and Beautiful', and the Christmas hymn 'Once in Royal David's City'. She was born in Dublin and began writing verse in her childhood, being strongly influenced by Dr Walter Hook, Dean of Chichester. Her subsequent religious work was strongly influenced by her contacts with the Oxford Movement and in particular with John Keble, who edited one of her anthologies. Her husband, William Alexander, was the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe and later became the Archbishop of Armagh. He was also the last Church of Ireland bishop to take up a seat in the House of Lords.","Businessman Kim Davies bought Llanwenarth House in Monmouthshire in 2006 and spent £1million on renovations .

"Once in a while, a colossal chunk of ice breaks free from Antarctica's majestic landscape and drifts out into the ocean. In March, Nasa was able to capture this remarkable event from space during a process that was months in the making. The monster iceberg, larger than Manhattan, was spotted breaking away from West Antarctica's Getz Ice Shelf by the U.S. National Ice Center (NIC). Scroll down for video . Last month, Nasa captured a 17 miles (27km) long iceberg being born in the West Antarctica's Getz Ice Shelf. The image on the left shows the landscape before the iceberg broke three and on the right the monster berg floating in the ocean . Glaciers in the Amundsen Sea of west Antarctica are losing ice faster than anywhere else on the continent and are the largest contributors to the rise of sea levels. Measuring 17 miles (27km) long, iceberg B-34 appears to have fractured and moved out into in the Amundsen Sea sometime in mid- to late-February 2015, Nasa said. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Modis) on Nasa's Terra and Aqua satellites took images spanning the calving event. B-34 is the 34th iceberg from the 'B' quadrant of Antarctica to be tracked by the NIC. The new berg is still smaller, however, than the much older B-15T- a fragment of B-15 that initially broke off from the Ross Ice Shelf in March 2000. The first image (left) shows the iceberg on February 16, when it was still attached to the ice shelf. By February 28 (middle), it appears to have separated somewhat. By March 5 (right), it is floating freely . B-34 is the 34th iceberg from the 'B' quadrant of Antarctica to be tracked by the NIC. Glaciers in this region are losing ice faster than anywhere else on the continent and are the largest contributors to the rise of sea levels . Large icebergs can have large-scale impacts on the Southern Ocean. For example, as the bergs melt, the addition of cold, fresh water to the saltwater ocean can affect ocean currents and circulation. Researchers have shown, however, that even more fresh water comes from the melting of smaller and much more numerous bergs. The Amundsen Sea has long been thought to be the weakest ice sheet in the West Antarctic. A study published in December suggests the barren region is haemorrhaging ice at a rate triple that of a decade ago. Researchers believe that the melting of glaciers in West Antarctica, which contain enough water to raise sea levels by at least a metre, may be irreversible. The findings of the 21-year study by Nasa and the University of California, Irvine claim to provide the most accurate estimates yet of just how fast glaciers are melting in the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Scientists found the rate by taking radar, laser and satellite measurements of the glaciers' mass between 1992 and 2013. They found they lost an average 83 gigatons per year (91.5 billion U.S. tons), or the equivalent of losing the water weight of Mount Everest every two years. Scientists are hoping to combine images such as this with noises recorded from icebergs to detect the different ways that glaciers lose ice into the oceans. Earlier this year, the incredible sounds of an ice 'cracking' and crashing down into water as an iceberg were recorded by researchers.. The scientists used underwater microphones aboard buoys to record a variety of iceberg births at the Hans Glacier in Svalbard, Norway during three days in August 2013. The recordings were then combined with time-lapse photos of the glacier during the same period. By synchronising the sound recordings with the photographs, the researchers discovered that different types of ice loss are associated with distinct rumbles, snaps and splashes. They are interested in this because the ice floating around Antarctica has thinned by nearly 20 percent, according to recent research. This is depleting the bulwark that prevents the permanent collapse of glaciers covering the southern continent. The study, based on satellite measurements between 1994 and 2012 by the European Space Agency, sheds new light on how Antarctic ice responds to climate change. Ice barriers have an average thickness of between 400 to 500 meters (1,300 to 1,600 feet) and can extend hundreds of kilometers off the coast of Antarctica. If the ice becomes too thin it would allow the permanent glaciers to slip into the ocean and start melting, sharply increasing the rise of ocean levels. Researchers found that the total volume of Antarctic ice changed little between 1994 and 2003, but after that point melting markedly accelerated. Ice in western Antarctica declined throughout the study period. A slight increase in ice thickness was observed in eastern Antarctica before 2003 when rapid melting began, leading to an 18 percent reduction of thickness compared to 1994. 'Eighteen percent over the course of 18 years is really a substantial change,' said Fernando Paolo, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego. 'Overall, we show not only the total ice shelf volume is decreasing, but we see an acceleration in the last decade.' If the rate of thinning continues, the ice shelves could lose half of their volume over the next 200 years, the researchers calculated.","Iceberg fractured from Getz Ice Shelf and moved into the Amundsen Sea sometime in mid- to late-February .

"A 'mean and despicable' couple who decorated their flat with sentimental trinkets and tributes that were looted from graves have been banned from cemeteries indefinitely. Sean Jefferson, 45, and Elizabeth Jowitt, 37, covered their home in York with wreaths, lanterns, memorial slates and homemade toys, all of which were once placed on gravestones by grieving family members. Some of the touching items were from the graves of babies, while others were from the gravestone of a grandmother who fought a courageous battle against cancer. Sean Jefferson, 45, and Elizabeth Jowitt, 37, (pictured outside court) admitted handling stolen goods at York Magistrates' Court after decorating their flat in items such as lanterns, wreaths, trinkets and homemade gifts . The couple's actions were eventually discovered when a relative of one of the victims noticed a heart-shaped wreath which was meant for her mother hanging in their home. She contacted police and a raid found further items such as love heart ornaments, rosary beads and homemade gifts being used as decorations. Jefferson and Jowitt pleaded guilty to two counts of handling stolen goods when they appeared at York Magistrates' Court this week. Jowitt had told police that someone had sold her the items which she wanted for 'decoration'. The couple escaped a prison sentence but were given a 47-week curfew and a restraining order banning them from cemeteries in the York area indefinitely. Kia Carlton, 26, said she had already felt suicidal after her daughter Telan died in her cot when she was just 11-months-old and said the disappearance of items from her daughter's grave was 'distressing'. Many of the items which vanished were homemade toys made by Telan's six-year-old brother Taran. In a victim impact statement read to the court, she said: 'I could not believe someone could stoop so low.' It was Angela Ryan who reported Jefferson and Jowitt to police, after she noticed items going missing from her mother Jennifer's grave. While on her way to work she spotted a wreath she believed to have been left for mother hanging in the window of the couple's flat. Items were taken from the grave of Telan Carlton (left) who died in her cot aged 11 months. Her mother Kia Stone said she had found it 'very distressing' that items, some homemade gifts, had gone from the grave . Other items vanished from Jennifer Ryan's grave, a charity fundraiser who passed away from cancer in 2013 . Jennifer's husband Matthew, a retired fork-lift truck driver, said in his statement that his wife had died after 'a long and brave struggle with cancer' in November 2013. The 61-year-old said: 'I was sickened to my stomach to find someone could be so heartless. 'My wife had been so much of a fighter so to hear that she could not even rest in peace was so cruel. 'I can't believe there are people out there so heartless and cruel.' Sentencing the couple, presiding magistrate JP Penny Curry said: 'We have read and taken on board the harrowing accounts from families devastated by the desecration of plots and the removal of items of great sentimental value found in the possession of both defendants.' She also condemned their 'mean and despicable crime' which she said has had a 'devastating effect'. As well as a curfew and indefinite ban from graveyards, the magistrate ordered the couple to each pay £340 court costs and a £60 surcharge. When Jefferson started muttering complaints from the dock about the terms of the banning order, the magistrate responded: 'No 'ifs' and 'buts'. 'Keep quiet, or we might have to retire and reconsider our sentence.' Following the sentencing, Ms Carlton branded their punishment 'disgusting' and said she wanted to 'see them go to jail'. Meanwhile, Trudy Ryan, 40, the daughter of cancer-victim Jennifer, said: 'No family should have to go through what we have gone through. 'They are pair of sick ghouls. They have no compassion or heart or thought for any ones feelings.' PC Pete McFarlane, of York Police, added: 'These items clearly have great sentimental value to the family affected by the theft and they are deeply upset that someone could be so heartless.'","Sean Jefferson and Elizabeth Jowitt decorated flat with trinkets off graves .

"The blue-eyed doctor who fled to join the Islamic State is still allowed to practice medicine in Australia despite appearing in a propaganda video encouraging foreign medics to join a terrorist cult. Former Adelaide doctor Tareq Kamleh featured in the latest ISIS propaganda video at the weekend wearing western-style surgical scrubs and handling babies in a maternity ward as he urged people to join the death cult notorious for beheading non-Muslims. Despite his public support for ISIS, Dr Kamleh still remains registered to practice medicine in Australia until September 30 because the Medical Board has refused to deregister him, the Advertiser reports. Former Adelaide doctor Tareq Kamleh, who fled to join the Islamic State, is still allowed to practice medicine in Australia despite appearing in a propaganda video encouraging foreign medics to join the terrorist cult . The Medical Board of Australia can deregister doctors convicted of crimes and can take action against those whose conduct goes against being a 'fit and proper person'. But no action has yet been taken against Dr Kamleh. 'The role of the Medical Board of Australia is to protect the public and manage risk to patients,' the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency said. 'The Board and AHPRA are not able to comment on this matter now, as doing so could compromise any future regulatory action.' Calling himself 'Abu Yusuf', Kamleh featured in the latest ISIS propaganda video at the weekend wearing western-style surgical scrubs and handling babies in a maternity ward . Dr Kamleh, who completed his medical dress at Adelaide University, worked as a paediatric registrar at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital until 2013. He then moved to north Queensland where he worked at Mackay Base Hospital, before working in Perth until late 2014. Dr Kamleh appeared in the ISIS recruitment video at the weekend calling for foreign medics to join him in the city of Raqqa to help launch the Islamic State Health Service. The video quickly went viral and caused his former medical colleagues in Australia to speak out. It has emerged Dr Kamleh has claimed he had unprotected sex with a Royal Adelaide Hospital patient who was a former sex worker and intravenous drug user after he checked her medical records, according to The Australian. Despite his public support for ISIS, Dr Kamleh still remains registered to practice medicine in Australia until September 30 because the Medical Board refused to deregister him . Dr Kamleh appeared in the ISIS recruitment video at the weekend calling for foreign medics to join him in the city of Raqqa to help launch the Islamic State Health Service . He also claimed to have slept with a patient at the Mannum District Hospital in South Australia. A former colleague who worked with Dr Kamleh during his stint at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in 2010 said he was a sexually manipulative 'creep', a 'fraud' and a 'sleazeball'. They also said he had a number of sexual relationships with nurses, doctors and other hospital staff, drank to excess and had a strong interest in shooting. 'I feel reluctant to speak ill of a former colleague, but as he is now portraying himself as a jihadist and calling others to join the so-called caliphate, I feel I should,' the colleague, who declined to be named, said. 'At the time, he was one of the most immoral people I knew, in terms of promiscuity at least.' The doctor completed his medical degree at Adelaide University and worked at various hospitals before fleeing Australia on a flight to Kuala Lumpur last month . The vision of Dr Kamleh handling babies in a maternity unit is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group . Another ex-colleague from South Australia said he had undergone a 'character transformation' over the past year. They claimed to have heard Kamleh had become 'devout' to such an extent he considered platonic friendships with women inappropriate, and he 'thought the way he had been living was wrong'. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton confirmed Dr Kamleh left the country on a flight to Kuala Lumpur last month. 'Reports on the weekend in relation to an Australian doctor going to serve in Syria are deeply disturbing,' Mr Dutton said. 'For a highly educated doctor to succumb to the message of this death cult is concerning to all Australians.' He could be sentenced to up to 25 years prison time if he returns to Australia and is charged. A former colleague who worked with Dr Kamleh during his stint at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in 2010 said he was a sexually manipulative 'creep', a 'fraud' and a 'sleazeball' Kamel could be sentenced to up to 25 years prison time if he returns to Australia and is charged .","Australian doctor who joined ISIS is still registered to practice medicine .

But one mother-to-be  had to give up much more than that for the sake of her unborn daughter. Lynn, from Chippenham, had to stop taking medication that enables her to move without pain as she suffers from a painful and crippling condition callled hip displasia. Lynn and husband Liam tried for a baby for three years so when she fell pregnant, she didn't want to take any risks so stopped taking pain relief for her scoliosis and hip dysplasia symptoms . The condition means the ball and socket joint of her hip has not formed properly, which causes pain when she moves. She also has scoliosis (curvature of the spine). Due to her disabilities, Lynn has to walk with a crutch around the home and uses a wheelchair when out and about. She also needs to take painkillers to give her some respite from the daily discomfort. But after becoming pregnant with a baby girl after three years of trying to conceive with husband, Liam, Lynn chose to stop taking the drugs for the time she carried their baby. She made the brave decision even though the weight of her baby bump put extra strain on her joints. 'I decided I would stop taking my painkillers when pregnant as there wasn't 100 per cent proof it would all be okay for baby so I stopped to be on the safe side,' she explained on My Extraordinary Pregnancy, which airs tonight on TLC. Lynn explains when pregnant that she's prepared to forgo pain relief for the sake of her baby . Healthy Libby was then delivered via caesarean section but Lynn had hoped for a natural birth . 'She's so special and it took such a long time to get her, I don't want to do anything to risk the pregnancy.' Husband Liam, an IT consultant, said he understood Lynn's decision but he said he found it hard to see her suffering. 'She wants to be a normal mother and do everything normally but because of her condition she's not always able to,' he said. 'My admiration for her has grown, the pain she goes through daily has increased and got worse every day. Coping with that without pain killers is a big thing.' 'The pain she's going through on a daily basis has increased.' Lynn, who has only 30 per cent mobility with her hips, said her problems began when she was a small child. 'The pain started when I was quite young and I had the first surgery when I was five. 'Growing up I had a lot of hip pain and back pain and initially I didn't know what it was. As a teenager I had to wear a body brace which was difficult.' Her mother Jennifer said: 'As a child she would never show when things hurt. You'd ask how she was feeling and she'd say ""I'm fine"", she would always cover everything up and tell you what you wanted to hear to make you feel better.' Lynn's condition was diagnosed as a teenager and she has always been determined not to let her disability get in the way of her living a 'normal' life. She works as an occupational therapist for the NHS, plays wheelchair tennis and wanted to be able to deliver her baby naturally despite her hip problems. Despite her hip problems, Lynn, pictured in hospital with Liam and Libby after her birth, had wanted a natural delivery but had to have a c-section as Libby was breeched . Adjusting to life as a mother with limited mobility means Lynn has had a chairlift installed in her home . The new mother is determined not to let her disabilities get in her way . However, this was not possible in the end as her baby was in the breech position so she had to have her daughter, Libby, via a caesarean section. Lynn said afterwards: 'It's been a hard journey but well worth it.' Following the birth. Lynn has to allow changes she's always resisted - such as having a chairlift installed in their home - to take place so she can better care for Libby with her physical limitations. Lynn admits she's always tried to do things for herself but she admits as a new mother, she has to accept more help for the sake of her daughter. Following the safe arrival of Libby, the couple had an anxious six week wait to find out if she also has hip dysplasia as there is thought to be genetic link. Those with hip dysplasia are five to ten times times more likely to have baby with condition and it's more common in female and first-born babies. Lynn and Liam return to hospital six weeks after Libby's birth to hear the good news that she doesn't also have hip dysplasia as there is a genetic link . The couple were delighted when a scan revealed Libby does not have the condition. However, if she did, the fact it had been detected early would mean doctors would be able to help her. This was something Lynn was keen to pursue as her own late diagnosis contributed to the mobility problems she has now. 'I'm so pleased she doesn't have to go through any of it,' she said after hearing Libby's six week scan gave her the all clear. 'If I have any doubts in my mind or as she's growing up I will push for her to be checked again.'

"It's the first food for a large number of the population, and many consider it to be one of the best starts in life a mother can give her child. And nutrient-rich, there is no denying that breast milk has myriad benefits for babies. But now one company has made the controversial move of using breast milk in a new vanilla ice cream aimed at adults. Scroll down for video . Royal Baby Gaga ice cream is made with donated breast milk - screened in line with hospital standards . Breastfeeding campaigner Victoria Hiley has teamed up with London-based ice-creamery The Licktators . Royal Baby Gaga ice cream is the brainchild of breastfeeding campaigner Victoria Hiley. The 30-year-old mother from Leeds has collaborated with London-based ice-creamery The Licktators to launch the dessert in celebration of the forthcoming birth of the Royal baby . Ms Hiley, said she wanted to remind the Duchess of Cambridge, and mothers around the country, of the benefits of breastfeeding. And also how delicious breast milk is, whatever your age. Royal Baby Gaga ice cream is made by The Licktators with donated breast milk - screened in line with hospital standards - and blended with Madagascan Vanilla. Ms Hiley was involved in the launch of Baby Gaga breast milk ice cream in 2011 and teamed up again with ice cream maker Matt O'Connor to create the product. The ice-cream comes in 500ml pink or blue tubs (left) and is blended with Madagascan Vanilla . A 500ml tub of Royal Baby Gaga has an RSP of £19.99 and is available in pink and blue tubs. All profits are to be donated to a breastfeeding charity. 'There was huge support from breastfeeding women for Baby Gaga ice cream in 2011, yet some politicians still stigmatise women for breastfeeding in public,' Ms Hiley said. 'We thought the birth of a royal baby was a great time to whip up support for mums and say that when it comes to ice cream this summer, breast is best. 'After all, what else would you give your young prince or princess?' The product will be available for sale at selected stores in London this summer and online at thelicktators.com. It may have the majority of the nation grimacing at the thought of it but admit it, it's got you curious. So what does it actually taste like? FEMAIL reporter, Martha Cliff, bravely tries the the controversial frozen treat. 'I've hit the 4pm slump and I am in search of a quick pick-me-up, ie. sugar. My face does fall slightly when I'm told that yes I am in luck, there is a large pot of vanilla ice cream on the desk however, it has been created using human lactation. 'I try to not to think about the ingredients and try to take reassurance in the fact that a human nipple is easily cleaner than a cow's udder. 'The flavour itself is not unpleasant at all. In fact the texture is what I would consider to be a luxurious gelato. 'It is extremely sweet, reminiscent of those blocks of vanilla ice cream that were served in school canteens. Having said that, if I had been given a bowl without knowing its origin I would have happily have eaten the lot, as it is I managed a few spoon fulls before it got a bit odd.'","Royal Baby Gaga the brainchild of breastfeeding campaigner Victoria Hiley .

"Queen Letizia comforted the grieving families of some of the victims of the Germanwings plane crash at a poignant memorial service in Barcelona today. Letizia, along with her husband King Felipe met with the relatives of some of the Spaniards who died in the crash in the French Alps last month. The flight, which was en-route from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, had 144 passengers and six crew members on board, including 50 Spaniards. Scroll down for video . Spain's Queen Letizia comforts one of the relatives of one of the victims of the Germanwings plane crash, which saw 150 people killed . Queen Letizia met with the families during a memorial service in Barcelona today to remember the 50 Spanish victims who died . Queen Letizia was joined by her husband King Felipe, who also embraced families,  as they remembered those who lost their lives in the crash . The Spanish Queen shakes hands with some of the students who had hosted German teenagers who died in the crash in the French Alps, while travelling back to Dusseldorf . Today at Barcelona's landmark Sagrada Familia basilica, Letizia shook hands and even embraced the families of some of those who died. She also met with students who had hosted 16 pupils from Germany, who had been visiting Spain and were travelling back to Dusseldorf on board the ill-fated flight. Dressed in black and looking sombre, Letizia and King Felipe also prayed for the victims during the service, which began with a recitation of 'Let the Earth Praise the Lord' in several languages. The memorial service, which took the form of a Catholic mass, was led by Lluís Martínez Sistach, the current Archbishop of Catalonia. Both Queen Letizia and King Felipe looked sombre as they entered Barcelona's landmark Sagrada Familia basilica and greeted the Archbishop of Barcelona Lluis Martinez Sistach, right . Also joining the royal couple were the Catalonia regional president Artur Mas and his wife Elena and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy . However, at the request of some of the families, other Christian, Jewish and Muslim religious leaders were present for the service in the enormous church designed by Antoni Gaudi. Also joining them was the Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, while 1,000 people gathered outside the World Heritage site to listen to the memorial service. Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed into the French Alps on March 26, when co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the captain out of the aircraft's cockpit. He then put the flight on a descent path, that sent it smashing into a mountain. The memorial service took the form of a Catholic mass inside the enormous church in the Spanish city designed by Antoni Gaudi . As well as the cathedral being full inside, more than 1,000 people gathered outside the landmark basilica to listen to the service . The Spanish King and Queen lower their heads to pray and reflect for the victims of the Germanwings crash at a memorial service today . Aviation industry doctors have since demanded that German pilots undergo more extensive medical checks, while several airlines worldwide have changed rules to require two crew in cockpits at all times. Lufthansa - the parent company of Germanwings - cancelled its 60th anniversary celebrations set for this month. A similar memorial for victims of the crash was held in Cologne earlier this month, which was attended by the victims' families and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.","Spanish royals attended memorial for victims of the Germanwings plane that crashed in the French Alps last month .

"Judge Mary Stacey admitted the victim had been 'scarred psychologically' by the sexual assault but freed Josh Sweet after serving just two months on remand . A burglar who broke into a young teacher's home and sexually assaulted her as she lay in bed has been freed by a judge who handed him a community sentence. The decision's been slammed by a Victim Support charity worker, who said that 'victims deserve justice', after the 24-year-old teacher was left traumatised by the ordeal. Judge Mary Stacey admitted the victim had been 'scarred psychologically' during the case at Birmingham Crown Court, which has left her 'petrified' and afraid to go out. But Joshua Sweet, 20, from Birmingham, was freed and given a three-year community order on account of an early plea and having spent just two months in jail awaiting his court appearance. Madhu Rai, prosecuting, said Sweet broke into the victim's home and took items including car keys and a mobile phone before making his way upstairs, where the victim was asleep. In the dead of night, she awoke to find the intruder 'standing beside her bed' and screamed, which is when the terrifying assault began. Sweet then rolled down her duvet and touched the defendant sexually, saying 'you're not going to make any noise are you?' Miss Rai said the woman was extremely frightened and tried to divert the defendant. Sweet touched the woman’s bottom and upper thigh but as he took hold of the waistband of her pyjama bottoms, her house-mate, the owner of the property, came into the room and he fled. The police were called and Sweet was arrested nearby, but the victim's ordeal continued. In a statement she said she had been 'petrified' at finding a stranger in her bedroom and that the incident, which had caused her to take time off work, had left her feeling vulnerable and unsafe. She said she had put a bolt on her bedroom door and had been reluctant to come out. Sentencing guidelines for sexual assaults range up to eight years for the most serious cases. And although the nature of this case falls in the lower end of the scale, the sentence angered a victim support charity that said offenders 'must be given a punishment that fits their crime'. Joshua Sweet, 20, admitted burglary and sexual assault and was given a three-year community order, ordered to do 150 hours unpaid work and must register as a sex offender for five years . Carolyn Hodrien, victim services director for Victim Support, said: 'From supporting thousands of victims of sexual assault, we know what a devastating impact it can have on people's lives. 'Victims deserve justice and for this to happen offenders must be given a punishment that fits their crime. Community orders can be a really effective way to manage some offenders, but should never be issued for a serious offence or as a quick-fix.' Sweet, 20, of Alwold Road, Weoley Castle, Birmingham, who admitted burglary and sexual assault, was also ordered to do 150 hours unpaid work and register as a sex offender for five years. The judge also made a restraining order banning the defendant from going to the victim's road or having any contact with her. Mohammed Hafeez, defending, said Sweet was a young man with many difficulties  and had been the victim of serious offences himself which had had a 'significant' effect on his mental health. He said the death of a daughter had caused him to drink to excess and that he had little recollection of what he had done.","Joshua Sweet, 20, broke into the house in the early hours of the morning .

Ian, who is single, and a vehicle image inspector, from Leicester, says that his obsession with the supernatural began at a very young age. 'It started when I was a kid and I was looking into the Loch Ness Monster and ghosts. 'I went on a couple of ghost walks and then went on a hunt. It got me hooked.' The £50 haunted dolls, which Ian gets from Jayne Harris, a professional in paranormal activity, are said to contain the spirits of people who have passed on.

'As soon as she picked up the doll she said she felt soaking wet, and that she knew Annabel had drowned.'

"The German government had been warned of a heightened risk of flying over eastern Ukraine just days before the MH17 disaster last year, it has been claimed. Despite being told of the risk of flying over Ukraine in diplomatic cables sent two days before the crash, Germany failed to pass on the warning, local media reported. Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine on July 17, and all 298 aboard were killed. Warning: Despite being told of the risk of flying over Ukraine in diplomatic cables two days before the MH17 crash, the German government failed to pass on the warning . German foreign ministry cables sent on July 15, cited an incident from the day before when a Ukrainian air force plane was shot down at around 20,000 feet over rebel-held territory. German intelligence had repeatedly warned of the risk to aviation security, and had assessed the downing of the Ukrainian military plane on July 14 as a 'significant development because of its altitude', German public TV channels NDR and WDR and Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported. Earlier this month, the Dutch government - which lost 189 citizens in the disaster - said that, with nearly all of the victims identified, efforts had shifted . to finding those responsible for shooting the plane down as it flew over Ukraine last July. After a meeting of foreign ministers from Malaysia, Ukraine and Australia on the . sidelines of a cyber-security conference in The Hague, Holland's Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said there was general agreement on this course of action. Tragedy: Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine on July 17 last year, and all 298 aboard were killed . 'Now that we're very far with repatriation (of the victims' remains), investigation and prosecution are becoming more . central,' Koenders said in a statement.

"The Google engineer who was killed when a deadly avalanche hit Mount Everest was given heartbreaking letters from friends and loved ones before he left - and told not to read them until he reached the summit. Dan Fredinburg was one of four Americans killed when a massive earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday, causing a wall of ice and rock to engulf the base camp. The 33-year-old, who was with three colleagues and had been navigating the area for Google Maps, was given the messages by his girlfriend Ashley Arenson just before he set off on the expedition. Dan Fredinburg was one of three Americans killed when the massive earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday, killing more than 3,700 people. He was given letters by friends and family when he reached the summit . The 33-year-old Google engineer was given the letters by his girlfriend Ashley Arenson just before he left . It isn't known whether he got a chance to read them. His friends have since uploaded a CrowdRise page in Fredinburg's memory, with all the funds going to relief efforts. More than $36,000 has been raised so far. Close friend Max Stossel posted a picture of the letter he wrote to his late friend on Saturday alongside a tribute. 'We lost one of my dearest friends yesterday. One of the most wonderful human beings any of us would have the pleasure of knowing,' he said. 'Dan is the most interesting, adventurous, human I've ever known. He was a silent force for justice in the world in a way I thought only existed in fiction, someone who cared about others so much that he sometimes had trouble looking them in the eye. 'Someone who created fun and mischief out of thin air. Someone who broke up fights by walking into the middle of them and dancing with both fighters. Someone who I think about almost every day, through the lens of ""What would Dan do?"". 'Before his climb, Ashley asked some of his friends and family to write letters to take up to the top with him. I hope he got a chance to read this one, and if he didn't, I hope he can somehow feel it now, along with the unbelievable amount of love and stories being shared around the world in his honor. His friend Max Stossel posted a picture of the letter he wrote to his late friend on Saturday alongside a tribute. In it he said: 'Your story has already greatly impacted mine for the better' In a tribute on Facebook, Stossel added that Fredinburg was 'one of the most wonderful human beings any of us would have the pleasure of knowing' Before embarking on his expedition, Fredinburg took part in a Puja ceremony in Kathmandu, to make sure 'all of his energies were aligned' As he approached the base camp he was given a black medallion and had his face slapped by rice and flour to grant him 'the wisdom and appearance of age' The letter read: 'Dan (dan dan dan) 'You must be really high up for this written Echo (echo echo). Everyone you know and love is eventually going to die (die die die). When we do, we leave behind our stories. 'Those stories are told and passed on, impacting the lives of others until they are stories (stories stories stories). 'Your story has already greatly impacted mine for the better. With each adventure you return with stories that most people wouldn't dream of experiencing themselves (selves selves selves). 'Thank you for pushing the human race to be greater, more daring, and to truly live life rather than survive it (it it it). 'I love you, brother. Please return safely with stories (stories stores). 'And even if you don't... We'll all be horrified, saddened, and heartbroken, that we can't create new stories with you but we'll also know that you've already lived the equivalent of at least 100 lifetimes. 'You are a f****** champion. Safe, wonderful & breathtaking journey. 'Love, Max Stossel (ossel ossel).' Elia Saikaly, a documentary maker from Ottawa, Canada, was at the Everest base camp when the avalanche hit. He described the dramatic moment he began looking for survivors and realized Dan was dead. Speaking to CBC, he said: 'I saw two of them, and I went up to them and I hugged them and I asked them if they were OK and they said yes. And I turned around and I said, ""Where's Dan?"" And there was this silence and there was this pale look. All they said was, ""He didn't make it,"" and it was as if all time just stood still.' 'And I was in a complete daze and I was in shock, and I just couldn't believe it. They had to be kidding. He was gone, just like that. ... It's a nightmare that you just want to wake up from.' Fredinburg started at Google in 2007. Beforehand he graduated from the Arkansas School of Math, Science and Art in Hot Springs in 1999, before moving on with his career. When he started at the technology company as product manager and the head of privacy at Google X, the company's secretive arm best known for 'moonshot' projects such as the self-driving car. He had been working on mapping Everest since 2013, meaning those interested in adventuring and expeditions could look up routes themselves. It is part of 'Google Adventure', a branch of the company that creates routes for users in extreme locations. His colleague Laurence You released a statement on Saturday saying: 'I just had the immensely sad task of sending the following to all Google employees. My thoughts are with everyone in Nepal, and with Dan's family and friends. 'Early this morning, Nepal experienced the worst earthquake in its history, registering 7.8 on the Richter Scale. Current reports are that over 1,000 people were killed. It's a terrible tragedy. 'Sadly, we lost one of our own in this tragedy, Dan Fredinburg, a long-time member of the Privacy organization in Mountain View, was in Nepal with three other Googlers, hiking Mount Everest. He has passed away. Fredinburg used to be in a relationship with One Tree Hill and Chicago PD actress Sophia Bush. The pair are pictured together at the Do Something Awards in 2013 . He uploaded a picture of himself relaxing in his tent on Day 16 of his trip . The Google engineer uploaded this picture while attending Burning Man in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada . 'The other three Googlers with him are safe and we are working to get them home quickly.' Google said it has launched a 'person finder' tool for Nepal to help people find loved ones in the aftermath of the quake and 'is working to get updated satellite imagery to aid in the recovery effort.' Google says it is committing $1 million to the quake response. Fredinburg was in a relationship with One Tree Hill and Chicago PD actress until last year. She paid tribute to her ex-boyfriend when the news of his death surfaced. She wrote on Instagram: 'There are no adequate words. Today I find myself attempting to pick up the pieces of my heart that have broken into such tiny shards, I'll likely never find them all. Today I, and so many of my loved ones, lost an incredible friend. 'Dan Fredinburg was one-of-a-kind. Fearless. Funny. A dancing robot who liked to ride dinosaurs and chase the sun and envision a better future for the world. His brain knew how to build it. His heart was constantly evolving to push himself to make it so. 'He was one of my favorite human beings on Earth. He was one of the great loves of my life. He was one of my truest friends. 'He was an incredible brother, a brilliant engineer, and a damn good man. I'm devastated and simultaneously so deeply grateful to have known and loved him, and to have counted him as one of my tribe. I was so looking forward to our planned download of ""all the things"" when he got home. 'I am crushed that I will never hear that story. I am crushed knowing that there are over 1,000 people in Nepal suffering this exact feeling, knowing that they too will never hear another tale about an adventure lived from someone that they love. Disasters like this are often unquantifiable, the enormity is too much to understand. 'Please remember that each person who is now gone was someone's Dan. Please remember that our time on this Earth is not guaranteed. Please tell those you love that you do. Right now. This very minute. And please send a kiss to the sky for my friend Dan. 'His energy is so big and so bright, and it's all around us, so put some love toward him today. And then hug your loved ones again.' New Jersey-born Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, was also killed when ice and rock crushed the 18,000-foot-altitude base camp where she worked as a medic for Madison Mountaineering.

"Four children were rescued from their Philadelphia home Sunday after police say their mother locked them in the basement for 15 hours without food as punishment for bad behavior. The woman, a single mother who reportedly works at the Philadelphia International Airport, is now facing four counts of endangering the welfare of a child. Firefighters rescued the woman's three daughters and a son, ages 9 to 13, at around 1.30pm Sunday after one of the children used an emergency-only cellphone to call 911. Scroll down for video . Rescue: Firefighters in Philadelphia rescued Sunday four children from the basement of a two-story home (second right) on East Atlantic Street . Harsh punishment: Police say their mother of the three girls an a boy locked them in this basement for 15 hours without access to food or bathroom . Firefighters broke through this second-floor window to enter the locked home and extract the hungry kids . First responders had to break through a second-floor window to enter the locked home in the 1900 block of East Atlantic Street in the Kensington section of Philadelphia. All four children were taken to St Christopher’s Hospital for Children for evaluation and were found to be in good condition. Neighbors were stunned to learn of the allegations against the mother of four, whom they described as a hard-working airport employee and nursing student. Block captain Victoria Sipes said her neighbor's children attend school regularly and are often seen playing outside with other kids. ‘It doesn't seem like her,’ Sipes told the station 6ABC. ‘I know that she's been going through a lot lately, but this is not something it would seem like she would do.’ Police spokeswoman Tanya Little said the mother deliberately locked her children in the basement at around 11pm Saturday, and they spent the next 15 hours without access to food or bathroom. A friend of one of the children, a 12-year-old girl, said she saw her arguing with her mother Saturday afternoon . A family friend told NBC10 the mother locked her kids in the basement because one of them stole money. Aphrodite Sanchez, a friend of the woman's 12-year-old daughter, said she saw the girl arguing outside with her mother Saturday afternoon. Following the rescue Sunday, the mother was taken in for questioning. Her children will be either placed with other relatives, or released into the custody of the Department of Human Services.","Single mother from Philadelphia is facing four counts of endangering welfare of a child .

"Millions of pounds were wiped off the value of leading housebuilders today after Labour announced a raft of new policies on housing. Ed Miliband today set out plans to scrap stamp duty for most first-time buyers, curbing rent rises and giving local people priority for new homes. But he also wants to ban developers hoarding land which could be built on, triggering a drop in the value of shares of construction firms. Ed Miliband used a speech in Stockton-on-tees today to promise there is 'nothing more British than the dream of home-ownership' as he sets out plans to prioritise new homes for local people . The move to clampdown on landbanking - where firms hold on to undeveloped sites while its value increases - has proven unpopular. Yesterday Mr Miliband said he would introduce rent controls if it won the election and ban private landlords from raising rents by more than the rate of inflation for the duration of new three-year contracts. It is thought the policies contributed to the fall in shares in leading housebuilding firms. Barrett Developments saw shares drop from more than £5.42 each to under £5.32 within two hours of the FTSE opening, and closed at £5.37, a 0.74 per cent decline on the day. Shares in Taylor Wimpey fell sharply from £1.70 to under £1.66 this morning, before recovering to £1.68, a fall of 0.47 per cent. Persimmon, the third housebuilder in the FTSE 100, also saw shares fall sharply this morning, but they made up the losses before the end of the day. 'Nervousness over the election is finally starting to filter into the FTSE 100. Rent controls will affect the housing sector,' said Atif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers. Mr Miliband, pictured checking his phone as he travels to Stockton by train, wants to ban developers hoarding land which could be built on . In a speech today, Mr Miliband said there is 'nothing more British than the dream of home-ownership' as he sets out plans to prioritise new homes for local people. He warned that too often new homes are 'snapped up before local people get a look-in' and promised to cut the cost of getting on to the property ladder. Nine in 10 people buying their first home will benefit from the stamp duty break, saving them up to £5,000, according to Labour. In a speech in Stockton, Mr Miliband said: 'There's nothing more British than the dream of home-ownership, starting out in a place of your own. 'But for so many young people today that dream is fading with more people than ever renting when they want to buy, new properties being snapped up before local people get a look-in, young families wondering if this country will ever work for them. 'That is the condition of Britain today, a modern housing crisis which only a Labour government will tackle.' Higher taxes will also be imposed on foreign buyers and up to half of new homes will be set aside for local residents. The plan would cost £225 million a year, which it says would be found through a series of tax-related measures. The battle for the support of Britain's aspiring homeowners has been electrified by a series of eye-catching policies from the main parties. David Cameron ordered a relaunch of Maragret Thatcher's Right to Buy policy, extending it to 1.3million families in housing association properties, while offering Help to Buy ISAs to people struggling to save for a deposit. The Lib Dems have promised tenants the chance to buy a stake in their homes through a Rent to Buy scheme. Under Labour's proposal, the planning laws would be changed to introduce a 'first call' policy that would give first time buyers who have lived in an area for more than three years priority on up to half of local new homes. It will also introduce a 'local first' policy that would stop properties being advertised overseas before they have been in the UK. Mr Miliband was greeted at the Arc Arts Centre in Stockton-on-Tees by Louise Baldock, the Labour candidate for the Stockton South seat . House prices are rising faster for first-time buyers than people already on the property ladder, according to Nationwide . Mr Miliband said: 'It is simply too expensive for so many young people to buy a home today, saving up for the deposit, paying the fees and having enough left over for the stamp duty. So we're going to act so we can transform the opportunities for young working people in our country. 'For the first three years of the next Labour government, we will abolish stamp duty for all first time buyers of homes under £300,000.' Chancellor George Osborne allowed a two-year holiday on stamp duty, which raised the threshold for first-time buyers to £250,000, to expire in March 2012, introducing a New Buy Guarantee in its place. Mr Miliband warns that too often new homes are 'snapped up before local people get a look-in' and promised to cut the cost of getting on to the property ladder . Buyers currently pay nothing on the first £125,000 of a home's value and are then charged on a sliding scale, starting with 2 per cent on the next £125,000 and 5 per cent on the following £675,000. Labour says it would fund the stamp duty plans by tackling tax avoidance by landlords, pointing to HMRC figures that estimate it costs £550 million a year. It claims introducing a national register of landlords would mean that figure could be cut by 20 per cent, bringing in £100 million for Treasury coffers. Holding companies that buy properties for investors would be hit by increases to the annual tax on enveloped dwellings while buyers from outside the European Union would be hit by a hike in their stamp duty bills of at least 3 per cent. Tax relief for landlords to cover the upkeep of furnished properties would also be reduced for rogue landlords that rent out sub-standard properties. A Conservative spokesman said: 'This panicky, unfunded announcement is something Labour have tried before - and it failed. Coming from the people who crashed the housing market and repeatedly raised stamp duty, this won't distract from Ed Miliband's inability to say what deals he will make with the SNP to prop him up in Downing Street. 'In contrast to Ed Miliband's gimmicks, because of our balanced economic plan, we've been able to deliver lasting reforms - cutting stamp duty for 98 per cent of people who would have paid it. 'Higher borrowing and higher debt under an SNP-controlled Ed Miliband government would mean higher mortgage rates and fewer first-time buyers.' A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: 'This is yet another unfunded promise from Labour. Just last week, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies told them they weren't being honest about their spending plans. It is clear they have learnt absolutely nothing. No-one should trust Labour to deliver this commitment because their sums simply do not add up. The Liberal Democrats have been honest about our spending plans; it's time Labour and the Tories did the same. 'Only the Liberal Democrats will really help people get on the housing ladder, by building the 300,000 homes needed to keep up with demand, helping young people afford the deposit for their rent, and helping people buy their homes over time through our Rent to Own plans.'","Miliband says there's 'nothing more British than dream of home-ownership'

"Clay Aiken, the loser in a November contest to represent the Second District of North Carolina in Congress, uncorked some show-biz venom Monday on the election's winner, Rep. Renee Ellmers. 'She's a b**ch!' Aiken told SiriusXM radio host Howard Stern, discussing his Esquire Network documetary program that chronicles his failed bid for a seat in the House of Representatives. The show is called 'The Runner-Up,' a reference both to ths election and to his second-place finish in the second season of American Idol. American Idol runner-up and congressional election runner-up Clay Aiken body-slammed Rep. Renee Ellmers on Monday's Howard Stern Show, calling her a 'b**ch' and an 'idiot' Ellmers, an intensive-care nurse by training, beat a seven-term incumbent in 2010 and won a third term by crushing Aiken in November . Ellmers, an intensive-care nurse who married a surgeon, plays an unwitting part in the show. 'She’s an idiot,' said Aiken, 36. 'And I think her self-esteem is just in the floor. Under the floor.' The 51-year-old congresswoman captured 58.8 per cent of the vote on her way to a third term, compared with Aiken's 41.2 per cent. He won the Democratic primary when his chief rival, businessman Keith Crisco, died suddenly after a fall. Crisco was a former state secretary of commerce and a political veteran. Aiken is sketching out a second political life on the small screen, and lobbed some publicity for his show at Stern's gigantic audience – along with some slaps at Ellmers. 'You should see the second episode, because she’s a bitch,' he said during the interview. A spokeswoman for Ellmers scoffed at Aiken, telling Daily Mail Online that his 'crude language and disrespectful demeanor towards the congresswoman has proven to the American people why he is a runner up.' Aiken doesn't much seem to care. He's already planning the third act in his political play, telling Stern that he's planning a future bid for elective office. MISSED IT BY THAT MUCH: Aiken conceded the race to Ellmers in November after she shellacked him by a nearly 18-point margin . 'Within the next decade I will [run] again,' he said. But 'not right now. Probably before six years.' Aiken, who is openly gay, also dove deep into his love life, telling Stern how hard he found it to date in New York City. He said he has stayed away from anonymous hookup apps like Grindr, insisting that he's 'not as much of a whore as people would like to think.' It seems Aiken picks his paramours from among men who friend him on Facebook. 'Here’s the honest truth: When people friend me – God, I'm goign to admit this to people – when people friend me, if it’s a guy who’s really cute, I’ll accept him,' he said. 'And then I’ll look at the pictures.' Suddenly realizing that he had unleashed a flood of male admirers who might stalk him on social media, Aiken let out a shriek, and shouted: 'S**t!' Stern's producers wrote an editorial note on his website Monday afternoon, discouraging the practice. 'DO NOT send Clay a friend request now – after today's interview he is no longer accepting Facebook friend requests for dates!' the warning read. Howard Stern, a shock-jock radio host with a broad following, asked Aiken about his Esquire Network show and his taste in men . TWO-TIME LOSER: Aiken placed second to Ruben Studdard (right) in 2003 in the second season of the American Idol talent-search show . Aiken insisted that he's skilled at screening out people who are only interested in him for his fame. 'My bulls**t detector is pretty f**king good,' he claimed. He also complained about a former boyfriend, a law profesor, who left him high and dry. 'He was an Aires, and he's flightly. ... Gay men are flighty as hell,' Aiken said. 'Who the f**k breaks up with Clay Aiken?' The Hill was first to report Aiken's on-air swipe at Ellmers.","North Carolina political also-ran also called Rep. Renee Ellmers an 'idiot'

The Goldilocks principle is a scientific term for when the state of something falls within certain margins, based on the children's story The Three Bears. In the story, Goldilocks finds a house owned by three bears. Each bear has their own preference for porridge and beds and after testing all three she determines that one is too hot, one is too large and baby bear's preference is 'just 'right.'

"The royals are again choosing private medical care for the upcoming birth of their second child. And Prince William and his wife Kate's decision to use St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London, over public care offered by the NHS was yesterday backed by the Prime Minister. Asked if the royal couple's choice was disappointing, David Cameron said he supports peoples' right to choose treatment options – but also ensured he praised the NHS. Scroll down for video . 'Matter of choice': Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured yesterday during a General Election campaign visit to Norton-sub-Hamdon in Somerset) has backed the royals' choice of private care for Kate's second birth . Private healthcare: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leave the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London, with their newborn  son Prince George in July 2013 . The Prime Minister, a father of three, told Murnaghan on Sky News: ‘I think it's a total matter of choice for people - what they use and where they have their babies. ‘All I hope and pray for is there'll be happy, healthy news for that wonderful couple and for the whole country. The NHS is superb and I've seen that in my own life in so many different ways. ‘But I believe in choice, I believe in people being able to do what they want to do, and as I say I've only got one thought about the royal baby which is a happy and healthy arrival.’ The baby is already believed to be late – and will officially be overdue if Kate has not given birth by May 1. Even the 33-year-old royal herself has said the baby is due in mid to late April. Anticipation: Barriers for the media outside the Lindo Wing on Saturday, which has a separate entrance from the rest of the hospital, making it easier to provide security and a measure of privacy to the couple . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s first child, Prince George, was born at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital nearly two years ago in July 2013. The wing has a separate entrance from the rest of the hospital, making it easier to provide security and a measure of privacy to the couple, who could receive a visit from the Queen. The public part of the hospital has seen a surgical ward closed to new admissions for the last 11 days because eight patients were found to be carrying a potentially dangerous microorganism. The hospital said today that three of these patients developed infections and have since recovered after treatment with antibiotics. It added that a ‘deep cleaning’ of the ward is underway and enhanced screening is being put in place. Mr Cameron's son Ivan, who had cerebral palsy and epilepsy, tragically died aged just six at the hospital in February 2009. And in his conference speech last October, the Prime Minister said he knew 'better than most' how much the NHS meant after the care it provided to his child.","Royal baby will be born at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London .

'While lines are now open this has resulted in a huge number of trains and staff being out of place with a number of services cancelled or changed.' The statement added staff were working 'flat out' to recover the service but delays were to be expected into the night. 'Passengers should check before they travel and consider any alternative routes,' they added.

"It’s been just over three years since Dana Vulin was set alight  at her Perth home, resulting in horrific third degree burns to more than 60 per cent of her body and countless operations to reconstruct her scorched face, arms and torso. Now the woman who turned her into a 'human fireball', leaving her unable to make simple movements such as straightening her elbows due to the agonising scarring, will argue her 17-year jail sentence was too severe. Lawyers for Natalie Dimitrovska will on Tuesday, in the Supreme Court of Western Australia, claim that Ms Vulin was not as badly injured as she stated in court, based on footage that shows her recovery filmed for Channel 7's Sunday Night program. Dimitrovska, who believed her former husband was involved with Ms Vulin and was envious of her beauty, vowed to ruin her ‘pretty little face’. She walked into Ms Vulin’s home on February 16, 2012, and hurled a bottle of methylated spirits over her setting her ablaze and changing the 29-year-old’s life  in every way imaginable. ‘I lost my enter life, I know that sounds huge but people don’t understand the enormity of not having my functionality, it’s my independence, my sexuality, my everything,' Ms Vulin told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Road to recovery: Dana Vulin suffered horrific third degree burns to her face and body. Using skin taken from her legs, doctors have reconstructed the 29-year-old's scorched skin over countless operations during the past three years. Ms Vulin has many more operations to come and still suffers greatly with functionality . During Dimitrovska’s original trial, in Western Australia’s District Court, Ms Vulin described how she 'was pretty much instantly on fire' during the attack. As she continues her long and painful recovery, spending most days in hospital and working with domestic violence and suicide prevention charities in her spare time, the dark prospect that Dimitrovska could be freed early looms. ‘I’ve been given a life sentence and she’s complaining about 17 years,’ Ms Vulin said. She found out a year ago that Dimitrovska was lodging an appeal to argue her sentence for grievous bodily harm with intent was ‘manifestly excessive’. ‘My understanding is she thinks it’s a sentence too long for what she has done. It’s just annoying I just want to move on and she’s already caused me enough pain, leave me alone,’ Ms Vulin said. 'I am accepting I’m always going to have scars, which is a necessity to move on': Almost three years on since her horrific attack, Ms Vulin spends most of her days in hospital still but is also working with charities . Lawyers for Natalie Dimitrovska (left and right) will on Tuesday claim that Ms Vulin was not as badly injured as she stated in court. They are appealing for her sentence to be reduced . She has ‘no idea’ if her attacker’s appeal will be successful however, as ‘it’s such a unique case, it’s unprecedented,’ Ms Vulin explained. Since the assault when she was 25-years-old, Ms Vulin spent two years and eight months wearing a compression mask to help put her face back together. ‘It made me feel like nothing of me was Dana, not the life I lived, the things I did and not the exterior. ‘I would have rather endured physical pain than wear that mask,’ Ms Vulin said. ‘It helped to shape the face and the pressure was so tight it helped flatten and massage the face and try to keep it from going inside out.’ The mask has now been removed but every morning when she wakes up she is stiff from her scars. ‘I am still in the early stages of recovery, I’m looking at least five years,’ she said. Ms Vulin spent two years and eight months wearing a compression mask to help put her face back together . 'I would have rather endured physical pain than wear that mask': Ms Vulin said as she looked back on the past three years since the heinous crime . ‘Physically I am accepting I’m always going to have scars, which is a necessity to move on. Yes I don’t look like anyone else but I’m damn proud about how far I’ve come and I’m as unique inside as I am outside.’ The Perth woman puts much of her progress down to her personality. ‘I was always strong. That is peoples’ biggest misconception about me. My looks were a bonus, I was strong in my heart and head before this… you’ve got to love who you are as a person because looks fade,’ Ms Vulin explained. However, she has countless more operations to come, with functionality prioritised over cosmetic procedures. Dana Vulin leaves court after watching the woman who set her alight and left her to burn to death jailed by a Perth judge for 17 years . Ms Vulin, seen here before the attack with her sister, was set alight by a jealous estranged wife of a man she had met once . ‘I’m a modern day Frankenstein… it’s absolutely amazing': Dana pictured here before the attack . ‘I’ve still got so much to work on. I can’t really bend my elbows or raise my arms. 'I’m stuck if I try to overstretch, I get a break down or wound because my skin is splitting,’ she explained. She spent Christmas and New Year in hospital having her new chest, shoulders and décolletage area operated on. ‘It failed the first time so I had to get it redone and it’s starting to scar again. They’ve taken skin from my right leg five times and my left leg four times,’ she said. ‘I’m a modern day Frankenstein… it’s absolutely amazing and the human body is beyond incredible. I am so eternally grateful for the doctors and physios at Royal Perth,’ Ms Vulin added. It would be very easy for Ms Vulin to be filled with hate about what happened to her but she insists ‘all I ever do is take positives’ from the situation. ‘I want my life back. I’m so grateful I’m alive, I can see, I can smell, I can touch. I still feel grateful. 'I want my life back. I’m so grateful I’m alive': Today Ms Vulin is looking at the positives to move forward . ‘I guess every day is a reminder but I try not to think that she did this me. I want to give it no power. I just have heartache and one step forward is ten steps backwards with the burns. ‘I’m used to disappointment now but I’m also used to getting back up and kicking it in the face,’ Ms Vulin said. As Ms Vulin continues on her recovery she is now working with the Men In Black suicide prevention charity, is an ambassador for the Kiss Violence Against Women Goodbye campaign and is also representing Lifeline WA in the 2015 HBF fun run as their official charity ambassador. ‘I try to get behind most charities but I guess with violence against women and the run it is all about a lifeline for healthy mind and healthy body, that's something I've experienced first hand through my recovery,' she said.

Appearing on Danish show Aftenshowet, she spoke of the grief she endured after losing her mother when she was 25. 'It felt like I was all alone with my grief,' she said. 'That no one understood me and that I stood still while everyone around me moved on.

'It felt like I was all alone with my grief': Mary spoke of feeling alone and misunderstood after losing her mother, Henrietta Donaldson, at 25 in a new TV interview . 'I would have liked to have spent more time with her,' she added. The Crown Princess' mother Henrietta Donaldson died in 1997 from a heart condition. Mary discussed the theme of loneliness with the programme and said, 'It's a real and big problem that's gone unnoticed, so I'm glad that it's drawing some attention now. 'There's still a lot of taboo around it, it's an issue we have to talk about.'

"George Osborne's economic record will come under fresh scrutiny with data expected to show growth slowed at the start of 2015. Experts predict that the economy will have grown by 0.5 per cent in the first three months of the year, down from 0.9 per cent in the same period in 2014. The Tories have stepped up their warnings about the risk to the economy, warning Britain is 'staring down the barrel' of higher taxes and regulations for businesses if Labour wins the election. Experts predict that the economy will have grown by 0.5 per cent in the first three months of the year, down from 0.9 per cent in the same period in 2014 . The latest growth figures will be released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) tomorrow morning, just nine days before voters go to the polls. Latest figures showed that the economy grew by 2.8 per cent in the whole of 2014, its strongest pace since 2006. It confirmed the UK as the fastest growing of the G7 major advanced economies last year. But since then official monthly figures have shown a dismal start to 2015 for much of the economy. Industrial production had a flat first couple of months while construction contracted in both January and February, according to the ONS. Separate figures today showed that factory output slowed to its weakest level in more than two years in the three months to April, held back by sluggish export orders. The CBI Industrial Trends survey said the strong pound and eurozone uncertainty helped drag down total output volumes to the lowest level since January 2013. Overall, total orders in the period moved from a balance of zero to plus one, lifted by domestic orders which rose modestly. However, economists had forecast a bigger rise. Chancellor George Osborne today visited George Bence and Sons, a construction supply firm in Cheltenham, Gloucester where he met company worker Alan Phillips . Mr Osborne also saw paint being mixed at the company, as he warned against a change in economic direction . Mr Osborne said small firms want him to 'finish the job and warn against a change which is far too risky and would undo all the good work of the last five years' The Tories were boosted today by a letter signed by 5,000 small businesses backing their economic plan. Mr Osborne said the firms 'say we need to finish the job and warn against a change which is far too risky and would undo all the good work of the last five years'. Campaigning in the South West, he said: 'We'll introduce law to ensure no one working 30 hours on the Minimum Wage pays any Income Tax at all, benefiting over 2.5million people in the South West.' The Chancellor promised his first Budget would set out increased funding for the NHS and 'protect incomes for pensioners with the triple lock'. Tory leader David Cameron today cast the Conservatives as the party of 'the small businesses, the entrepreneurs, the techies, the roof tilers, the retailers, the plumbers, the builders' and said a Tory Government would continue delivering the 'pro-business environment' which small companies want, which would be at risk if Ed Miliband wins on May 7. Unveiling the Tories' small business manifesto in London, Mr Cameron warned: 'Labour think they know how to spend your money better than you do. They will put up your taxes. Labour think they know how to run your businesses better than you do. They will put up your regulations. 'You know what they call you? They say business is a predator. This is not some Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. This is what we are staring down the barrel of in 10 days' time if we don't get out there and fight for jobs and fight for enterprise and fight for our economy, and that's what we are going to do.' He added: ""If you think I'm going to roll over in the next 10 days and let Ed Miliband and Alex Salmond wreck that, you've got another think coming. We have got a fight on our hands and I am going to win that fight. It's a battle for the backbone of Britain, that's what this election is about."" If tomorrow's figures show lower levels of growth it is likely that interest rates will remain at their record low for even longer. In an impassioned speech to activists in London today, David Cameron insisted he was 'pumped up' for the election battle . The jacketless PM used a deliberate display of anger to prove that he is 'pumped up', as activists and owners of small businesses gathered around him at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in London . The Bank of England is unlikely to increase the cost of borrowing until next year for fear of hampering the recovery. Scotiabank's Alan Clarke said he was pessimistic on growth, expecting it to decelerate to 0.4 per cent for the first quarter, adding that he 'wouldn't rule out an even lower number'. But he said the second quarter should be much stronger. Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics said: 'The first estimate of GDP seems likely to show that the recovery slowed in Q1 and may therefore put the coalition parties on the back foot just nine days before the General Election. 'Nonetheless, we doubt that the recovery is on the cusp of a slowdown. Households' incomes are on track for their strongest growth since 2006 this year. 'Meanwhile, borrowing costs are falling and monetary stimulus appears to have revived the eurozone economy.' Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said he expected a slowdown to 0.5%, saying it would be 'very unwelcome' for coalition parties 'hoping that many undecided voters will ultimately decide to vote for them due to their management of the economy'. 'However, we believe growth prospects are still decent for the UK economy as long as there is not prolonged political uncertainty following the General Election. 'The fundamentals look particularly promising for consumer spending. 'Extended low oil prices and generally limited input prices should boost companies' margins and be supportive to business investment along with a generally healthy economic environment and improved profitability.' A new survey by Lord Ashcroft had the Tories on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent . The Tories could be six points ahead of Labour, or three points behind, depending on which opinion poll to believe. The latest batch of surveys agree on only one thing: the result is probably too close to call. David Cameron's day will have been brightened by a six-point lead in a survey by Lord Ashcroft. The Tories are on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent. Another poll by ICM for the Guardian also gave Mr Cameron's party a lead, but of only three points lead on 35 per cent to 32 per cent for Labour. However, the Sun's YouGov poll had Labour in the lead on 34 per cent to the Tories' 33 per cent, indicating that the battle for No 10 remains agonisingly close for the party leaders. Labour enjoyed a three-point lead in a Populus poll, on 36 per cent (up one point) to the Conservatives' 33 per cent (up one). North of the border, a TNS poll found Scottish National Party support continuing to surge to 54 per cent, almost two-and-a-half times Labour's 22 per cent.","Office for National Statistics to release growth data for first quarter of 2015 .

"Everyone knows the tortoise  beat the hare, but this little fellow has gone one better and beaten two cheetahs. These pictures capture the amazing moment when one of the notoriously slow-moving reptiles escaped becoming big cat fast food  by retreating into its shell before scuttling off across desert sands. The baffled cheetahs surrounded the tortoise and attempted to scare it out of its shell with snarls but the reptile kept well tucked up inside its tough exterior forcing the big cats to wander off in search of another snack. Hard target: The tortoise attempts a quick getaway under the watchful eye of one of the curious cheetahs . Confused: The two cheetahs exchange glances as they move in to size up their potential meal . The intriguing scene was captured by John Mullineux, a chemical engineer from Secunda, South Africa. He said: 'While driving on the sandy tracks of the Kalahari Desert in South Africa, I came across two cheetahs lying in the shade near the road. 'Shortly after I stopped, they got up and slowly headed to the dunes. 'Halfway up the red sandy dune the younger one stopped to inspect a tortoise, the older one also stopped and tried to bite the shell but couldn't manage it. Now you see me: The tortoise retreats into its shell as the big cats get too close for comfort . Snarl: One of the cheetahs gets up close and personal to the little reptile and tries to scare it out of its shell . 'By the time the older cheetah had made it to the top of the dune, the younger one decided to run off and follow rather than spend more time at the hard meal. 'The tortoise then casually moved on as if nothing unusual had happened. From a young age I have loved cheetahs for their elegance and speed - seeing two so close was dream but seeing them size up their lunch was unique. 'It was something that was both exciting and naturally beautiful at the same time.' Slow and steady: The tortoise continues his escape across the sands of the Kalahari desert in South Africa .

"An HIV self-testing kit is on sale for the first time in the UK. The 99.7 per cent accurate BioSure HIV Self Test enables people to test themselves when and where they like. An estimated 26,000 people in the UK have HIV but are unaware of it and may be transmitting the disease to others. The 99.7 per cent accurate BioSure HIV Self Test enables people to test themselves when and where they like . The testing kit, on sale online, uses a small amount of blood from a finger-prick sample to detect the presence of HIV antibodies, giving a result in just 15 minutes . Treatments available mean HIV is now a manageable disease – but late diagnosis can have a devastating impact on health and life expectancy. The National AIDS Trust warns that 40 per cent of those living with HIV remain undiagnosed for at least four years, with those diagnosed late 11 times more likely to die in the first year after diagnosis. The testing kit, on sale online, uses a small amount of blood from a finger-prick sample to detect the presence of HIV antibodies, giving a result in just 15 minutes. BioSure founder Brigette Bard said it is a significant step towards normalising HIV testing, adding: 'Knowing your HIV status is critical and the launch of this product will empower people to discreetly test themselves when it is convenient to them and in a place where they feel comfortable.' Positive test results need to be confirmed by a healthcare professional and those in high-risk groups are recommended to be tested every three months. The only alternative currently available is 'home sampling', which involves collecting a blood sample 160 times larger than that for the self-test and posting it to a laboratory, with results given five days later.

"Telecom watchdogs are to stop a rip-off that allows mobile phone firms to charge customers to call supposedly free 0800 numbers. Currently mobile phone companies charge customers up to 20p a minute to dial what are free numbers from a landline phone. The net result is that millions of people dialling what should be free services run by the NHS, the government and company call centres end up paying hefty charges. Scroll down for video . End call: Charges of up to 20p a minute being charged by operators for free 0800 numbers will end from July 1 under proposals published by the telecoms watchdog, Ofcom, today . Alternatively, some who rely on mobile phones rather than landlines are put off accessing these services by the cost. The charges will end from July 1 under proposals published by the telecoms watchdog, Ofcom, today. The changes were fought by the mobile phone networks, which have been making tens of millions of pounds a year from customers calling the numbers. In 2013, the biggest mobile network, EE, even threatened to take legal action to block the move. At the time, the company, which is about to be taken over by BT in a deal worth £12.5billion, complained getting rid of charges for 0800 numbers was ‘ill thought out’ and would ‘crush an already struggling industry segment’. It argued the change could cost up to £57.5 million to implement and that mobile networks would simply put up other charges to make up for any lost income. Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at the price comparison service, uSwitch.com, said the end to mobile charges to call 0800 numbers was a ‘long-overdue victory for common-sense’. EE claims the plan is ill thought out and will make an already struggling industry suffer . A spokesman for the telecoms price comparison website, broadbandchoices.co.uk, welcomed moves to make the price of calls clearer to consumers. He said: ‘Making ‘0800’ numbers free from all telephones including mobile phones is excellent news since it’s rarely practical to redial from a landline to avoid charges for what are generally assumed to be ‘free phone’ numbers. ‘Greater cost transparency and simplicity of charging is badly needed in the landline and mobile phone sector. We regularly hear from consumers who are confronted with charges on their phone bill that they were unaware of.’ The changes are part of a wider shake-up in call charges to non-geographic numbers, which are described by Ofcom as the ‘biggest overhaul of phone calls in more than a decade’. They are part of a new regime imposing new rules covering the cost of calling the 084, 087 and 09 numbers used in TV show phone polls, by businesses, GP surgeries and government departments – as well as 118 directory enquiry numbers. At the moment, the cost of calling these numbers is mired in confusion with charges varying enormously depending on whether you are using a landline or a mobile phone. In future, organisations using these numbers will be required to advertise a single ‘service charge’ for dialling them. Separately, each phone company will apply an ‘access charge’ for putting people through. Consumers will add the two figures together to work out the full cost, which will vary depending on which phone company they are signed to. Ofcom and phone companies will be publicising the changes under the banner UK Calling before the switch in the summer. The regulator’s chief executive, Sharon White, said: ‘In July we’ll see the biggest changes to phone calls in over a decade, affecting 175 million phone numbers. ‘The changes are important for people who enjoy interacting with their favourite shows, but also for everyone calling companies and organisations on 08, 09 and 118 numbers. s.poulter@dailymail.co.uk .","Operators are charging up to 20p a minute - even if 0800 numbers are free .

"The chilling reenactment of how executions are carried out in Indonesia which was broadcast to millions of viewers is set to become a brutal reality for Andrew Chan and Myruan Sukumaran. Time has run out for the Bali Nine ringleaders who will face 12 marksmen, with only three of them holding loaded guns, at the stroke of midnight on Tuesday night - 3am Eastern Standard Time - in the depths of the jungle on Nusakambangan Island in Java. The Australian men are expected to be led from their isolated cells in Batu prison through the wildly dense tropical forest up a 3km steep winding track to a place called Nirbaya - or more appropriately known as Death Valley. Scroll down for video . Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right) will be given white clothing to wear and a choice whether to be blindfolded as they face the firing squad at the stoke of midnight on Tuesday . The final chilling steps to execution in Indonesia . A disturbing recreation of the execution was aired on Indonesian TV the day before five foreign drug traffickers were killed in January . Millions of viewers watched the chilling reenactment of the execution played out on national TV . The condemned pair will be given white clothing to wear, which symbolises the afterlife, before beginning their fatal trek and are given the option to be blindfolded with a piece of fabric before facing the firing squad who will be lined up anywhere from five to 10 metres in front of them. The confronting decisions continue for the death row inmates with the opportunity to choose whether to stand, sit or kneel before a cross is placed over their hearts acting as a target for the 12 riflemen - of which nine will have blanks and only three will have live rounds. If necessary their hands or feet will be tied to a 3m high pole or worse still - a wooden execution chair. The offender is then given a final chance to calm down for a maximum of three minutes before the riflemen are ordered to shoot them in the heart. It is then that the executing commander brandishes his sword as a sign for the 12 shooters to begin to fire their rifles. If the doctor confirms once the fires have been shot that the prisoner is still breathing - the executing commander orders for a pistol be put to the temple just above the ear for a final shot. However, the shooting can continue on the condemned, if the doctor declares that there is still signs of life. Some of the last words the men  will hear are 'laksanakan, laksanakan' - meaning 'execute, execute' in Indonesian. The Australian men will be given a maximum of three minutes to calm down before being shot in the heart . Three shooters will have live rounds while nine other rifelemen will have blanks . The TV footage broadcasted four months ago showed Brimob executioners dressed in military fatigues with semi-automatic rifles practicing for the following day's execution by repeatedly firing at bullseye targets . Not even refusing to sign their death warrants on Saturday will delay the pair's deaths for their hand in plotting to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali 10 years ago. The stark reality struck for the pair when they requested their final wishes - Sukumaran to continue his love of painting right up until the bitter end and Chan, who became a minister during his time behind bars, to attend a church service with his family. The prisoners can also make a final written request which can include declaring their guilt or innocence, along with how and where they wish to be buried. One of the last paintings Sukumaran will ever create was shown to the media on the Javanese island by his Australian lawyer Julian McMahon on Saturday. The haunting self portrait depicts a gun shot wound to his heart. This comes as coffins with both men's names and Wednesday's date were inscribed on wooden crosses by local funeral director Suhendra Putro.

"It is a week which has seen him in deep water - both on and off the pitch. Just days after Dallas Cowboys' Greg Hardy was suspended from 10 NFL games he appeared to get into trouble when he drove his luxury car through flash floods in Dallas, getting stuck when the car could not make it through the rising, fast flowing waters. The 25-year-old was forced to abandon his Bentley, leaving it stranded until the waters receded and the car could be towed away. It took the tow truck several hours to successfully remove the car and Hardy was later seen returning to the vehicle to collect some of his possessions. He left in another luxury car, a white Ferrari. Scroll down for video . Greg Hardy found himself in more deep water when he was forced to abandon his Bentley in flash floods . The problem with his car comes as more bad news for Hardy who was suspended by the NFL just days ago after an incident of domestic abuse that allegedly occurred last year. Hardy, who signed with the Dallas Cowboys last month, will be forced to sit out the first 10 games of the season and will not receive his salary for these games. Last year Hardy, 25, was convicted by a judge in Charlotte, North Carolina of beating, strangling and threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend, Nicki Holder. Those charges were later dropped on an appeal when Holder could not be located to testify. A two month investigation by the NFL followed and officials decided he had to be suspended. Hardy was informed in a letter from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that the probe determined there was 'sufficient credible evidence that Hardy engaged in conduct that violated NFL policies in multiple respects.' Hardy was dropped by his previous team, the Carolina Panthers, because of these charges last season, but was still able to collect his salary during that time, which was roughly $770,000 a week. Hardy previously played for the Carolina Panthers but was dropped after allegations of domestic abuse emerged and was then signed by Dallas Cowboys and suspended for 10 games by the NFL . Hardy is seen talking to officials after his Bentley got stuck in flash floods in Dallas this week . 'I understand that I need to step away from football right now and take care of this legal matter,' Hardy said in a statement after he was cut from the Panthers. The Panthers had originally agreed to wait to take action until Hardy had a jury trial regarding the incident in May. His previous conviction was the result of a bench trial. A jury trial ultimately led to all charges being dropped. Holder told police that Hardy choked her, slammed her against a bathtub, threw her to the floor and threatened to kill her after a fight at his Charlotte condo. The Dallas Cowboys star was seen attempting to drive his Bentley during the floods, but had to abandon it . It took officials and a tow truck several hours to pull the luxury Bentley free from Dallas flood waters . This all came at a time when the league was under heavy scrutiny in the wake of two abuse scandals involving stars Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. Many were upset with the punishments those two received, feeling the NFL was too lenient. Video of Rice punching then-fiancée Janay Palmer went public last Monday, and Peterson was indicted on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child on Friday for an incident in which he hit his son with a switch back in May. Hardy (above) was convicted by a judge last July of beating, strangling and threatening to kill ex-girlfriend Nicki Holder . The NFL announced  that Hardy would be suspended without pay for 10 games at the start of the 2015 season . Holder (above with Hardy) told police that he choked her, slammed her against a bathtub, threw her to the floor and threatened to kill her after a fight at his condo . Rice was definitely suspended from the NFL and had his contract terminated by the Baltimore Ravens, while Peterson, who was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings last Sunday, has now been suspended by the team. Both men are expected by many to return to play in the 2015, with Peterson back on the Vikings after an NFL decision and Rice winning a wrongful termination suit during the off-season. Rice even pocketed roughly $1.6million in back pay.","Hardy was convicted of domestic abuse against ex-girlfriend Nicki Holder and was suspended from the Dallas Cowboys for 10 days by the NFL .

"Despite the hype surrounding its first watch, the iPhone is still the engine behind Apple's phenomenal success, its latest figures have revealed. The results far surpassed most analysts' expectations for the first three months of the year, when sales traditionally fall from their holiday-season peak. Apple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter, accounting for more than two-thirds of its $58 billion in revenue for the quarter and the lion's share of its $13.6 billion in profit - and up 40% from a year ago . Sales of iPhones in China were also revealed to have outstripped those in the US. Apple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter, accounting for more than two-thirds of its $58 billion in revenue for the quarter and the lion's share of its $13.6 billion in profit. $58 billion in revenue, $13.6 billion in profit . $200 billion in cash, up from around $150 billion a year ago. More than 61 million iPhones sole . iPad revenue fell 29% to $5.4 billion . Revenue from Mac computers rose 2%from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion . 'We are thrilled by the continued strength of iPhone, Mac and the App Store, which drove our best March quarter results ever,' said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. 'We're seeing a higher rate of people switching to iPhone than we've experienced in previous cycles, and we're off to an exciting start to the June quarter with the launch of Apple Watch.' As expected, the numbers were down from the previous quarter, when holiday shoppers snapped up a record 74 million of Apple's new iPhone 6, 6 Plus and older models. But it was a 40 percent increase over the number of iPhones sold in the first three months of 2014. 'We're seeing great results all over the world,' Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri told The Associated Press, adding that iPhone sales grew 72 percent in China, where the company has big hopes for expansion. Other products played a much smaller role. Revenue from Mac computers rose 2 percent from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion, while iPad revenue fell 29 percent, to $5.4 billion — continuing a steady decline in tablet sales. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. Maestri said customer response had been 'positive.' Analysts estimate about 2 million have sold to date, suggesting early demand is healthy but not of blockbuster proportions. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. 'It's been really great to see the reaction of customers,' said Cook. 'The response has been overwhelming. We can't wait to see more of the inspiring apps developers dream up.' The iPhone is another story. Since it began offering models with bigger screens last fall, Apple has vied with South Korea's Samsung for the No. 1 position in the global smartphone market. By some estimates, Apple outsold Samsung in the quarter that ended in December, and analysts will be watching closely when Samsung reports its latest results this week. Apple also announced an expansion of its effort to return more of its sizable cash war chest to investors. The company said it will raise its quarterly dividend by 11 percent, to 52 cents a share, and has increased a $90 billion stock buyback program to $140 billion. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. In total, the company said the program will return $200 billion to investors by the end of March 2017. As iPhone sales have surged, so has Apple's stock. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. The stock closed Monday at $132.65, up 1.8 percent for the day, and was rising in late trading. The iPhone isn't just Apple's 'dominant product,' said Frank Gillett, a tech industry analyst at Forrester Research. 'It's more than anything else what's driving the success of their company.' Market researchers, however, expect growth in the world smartphone market will slow this year, particularly at the higher price range where Apple competes, as most consumers in developed countries have already bought one. That could make it difficult for Apple to maintain its recent pace. 'They're extremely dependent on the iPhone,' said investment Colin Gillis at BGC Partners. 'At some point, the market dynamics change,' he said, adding that 'the question is what could replace the iPhone' if sales begin to slow.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he's optimistic about new markets such as China, where Apple has made a strong showing against Samsung and China's Xiaomi. And even if Apple is increasingly selling new iPhones to people who are simply upgrading older models, 'that's still a pretty healthy market,' said Gartner analyst Van Baker, noting that more than 700 million iPhones have been sold since the first model was introduced in 2007. Maestri also stressed the potential for new products like Apple Watch and Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment service. While these currently provide minimal revenue, analysts say they have big potential. And they are designed to work closely with the iPhone, which means each may bolster the other's popularity in the future, Gillett said.","Apple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter .

'I think his body clock was round the wrong way and it just got everything round the wrong way and he's over done it.' Mr Hawley was a father to four children, Lucia, 16, Hamish, 14, James, 12, and Sybella, eight, all of whom he shared with Nicole Kidman's sister Antonia before their 2007 split.

Both 44-years-old Antonia and her ex husband both remarried following their divorce in 2007 - she to businessman Craig Marran in 2010, and he to Sydney fashion boutique manager Prue, the following year. He has kept himself largely out of the spotlight following his split from Antonia and a battle with depression. The father of four checked himself into a Sydney rehab clinic in 2007 following a period of mental health issues. Tragic: Antonia's second husband Craig Marran accompanied her, her sister Nicole and husband Keith Urban to Dr. Antony's funeral in September last year . He told Woman's Day in 2009: 'I was depressed, out of control and full of self-loathing, and I resorted to drugs to get through it. 'I wasn't in a happy place and it was an appalling thing, but I was sick, and at least I was big enough to do something about it.'

'The most loving father to his four wonderful children and adoring wife. His family was his treasure. His kids were his life,' he continued.
