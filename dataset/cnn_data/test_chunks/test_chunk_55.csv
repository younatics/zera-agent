"A mother of two who works as a high-class escort has told how she received 'a torrent of abuse from the thinly pursed lips of apparently ""better"" mothers' when she revealed her double life on national television. Amanda Goff, known to her clients as Samantha X, is a former journalist wrote a book about her experience after becoming a global sensation. In her new book, Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort, the 40-year-old said she was shocked her revelation garnered so much attention from the media, with interview requests flooding in from news organisations all over the world. After being labelled ‘a whore and a s*** and an anti-feminist’, Ms Goff said the most troubling part of her ‘coming out’ experience was the response she received from other mothers, who expected her children to ‘endure a life of misery’ because of her abnormal profession. Scroll down for video . Former journalist Amanda Goff appeared on a TV show in LA about sex and relationships and defended her decision to reveal her identity as escort Samantha X . ‘The fact I had kids caused a torrent of vitriolic abuse spouting from the thinly pursed lips of apparently ‘better’ mothers than me who thought my role in society was awful, tutting my ‘poor, poor’ children and raging about what a terrible, selfish mother I was, and how because of my job, my kids would have to endure a life of misery, bullying and shame (probably from their own kids),’ she wrote. Although Ms Goff, who has worked at New Idea, InStyle and Prevention magazines, knew her story would one day become ‘old news’, she said she felt physically sick in the weeks following her revelation. After a stern talking to from a close friend, Ms Goff said she decided to ‘toughen up’ and start focusing on the people in her life who she thought really mattered. The mother-of-two said her harshest critics were other mothers concerned with the ‘life of misery’ her children were expected to endure . ‘The people who loved me knew who I was. I adored my kids, and my kids adored me. I was a good person, a good mum, a good friend.’ Ms Goff said she was glad she has been able to tell her story and reveal the ‘emotional turmoil’ and ‘torture’ she faced after she outed herself as an escort. She explained that among the negativity, she also received many messages of 'kindness' and 'support'. Some even told her they were inspired to leave their mundane jobs to pursue a career in the sex industry. Ms Goff claims her job as a sex worker, is more ethical than her former career as a journalist in which she admits she hid in bushes and illegally hacked phones . Goff said she is not ashamed of her decision to go public and says she is the 'happiest' she has ever been . ‘They want to thank me for going public and making them realise it was okay to like sex, and want to get paid for it,’ she said. Not only did Ms Goff receive support from those who wanted to follow in her footsteps, she was also commended for her strength and courage by women who already worked in the sex industry. While she copped a lot of flack for admitting she worked in the sex industry, Ms Goff said her job as a sex worker, was more ethical than her former career as a journalist where she was asked to hide in bushes and illegally hack phones. Discussing her personal life, Ms Goff confirmed her ex partner and the father of her children had known about her x-rated career ‘for yonks’ and although he did not support it, she had never deceived him about it. Ms Goff's ex-husband, Sydney banker David Basha (right) told Daily Mail Australia that he was disgusted with his former wife's decision to publicly announce her identity . Ms Goff spends one week as a full-time mother to her children - who she shares custody with Mr Basha - and the next in a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD where she carries out her life as Samantha X . Hooked: Amanda Goff reveals why she decided to out herself as a high-class escort and what happened after her big secret became a global sensation . Ms Goff's ex-husband, Sydney banker David Basha, told Daily Mail Australia last year that he was disgusted with his former wife's decision to publicly announce her identity. He said: 'It's a disgrace. I have had to explain to my kids what's going on. I'm worried about my family, I just really want to leave my kids out of this.' After cutting ties with her former flame and coming out as an escort, Ms Goff said Samantha X was inundated with requests and claimed she could have pocketed a ‘million dollars’ if she'd have seen every person who inquired. However, after enduring months of public scrutiny, Ms Goff said her time as an escort was coming to an end. She said that while she would miss the extravagant lifestyle, at this stage in her life, she had become more concerned with finding a long-term partner. ‘Samantha X is afraid of love,’ she revealed. ‘I am sick of being afraid. I am sick of sleeping alone.’ If you want to learn more about Amanda Goff's story you can read about it in her tell all book Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort.","Former journalist Amanda Goff has spoken out about her life as an escort .

"Accused murderer Gable Tostee, who was involved in an alcohol-fuelled chase with police across state borders, will remain behind bars for dangerous driving charges after a judge dismissed his appeal for early release. Tostee, 29, was on bail for the alleged murder of New Zealand woman Warriena Tagpuno Wright when Tweed Heads magistrate sentenced him to 10 months behind bars  for the driving offence that occurred in July. The 29-year-old was reportedly four times over the legal limit when he incited a high speed police chase as he drove two passengers home to the Gold Coast from Splendour in the Grass, a music festival at Byron Bay. Scroll down for video . Back behind bars: Accused balcony murderer Gable Tostee (pictured) was denied an early release for his drunken car chase with police across state lines after where he was found to be four times over the legal limit for drink driving . New South Wales police deployed road spikes in an effort to stop Tostee who was travelling at speeds of around 200 kilometres an hour. The accused murderer continued to drive on the car's rims until the chase came to an end, after he had crossed the Queensland border. Tostee admitted to police he was intoxicated and his vehicle was unregistered. The incident was two weeks before Wright fell to her death from the balcony of Tostee's 14th storey apartment in August last year. Police will allege Ms Wright fell after a struggle between the pair. During the appeal hearing, Judge Martin Blackmore heard that Tostee did not have access to his regular prescription medication which caused him to suffer episodes of anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder, ABC reported. Dad's car: Tostee (pictured leaving prison last November) borrowed his father's car for a booze-fuelled rise across into northern NSW and then back over the border where he was booked by Queensland police just weeks before he allegedly murdered Warriena Wright on a Tinder date . Philip Crick, Tostee's solicitor, told the court his client's medical condition was exacerbated as he was required to share a cell during his time in protective custody. During his appeal, prosecutor Kate Brady told the court Tostee had an 'alcohol issue' and that the crime fit the 10 month sentence he was given. Judge Blackmore said as Tostee was heavily intoxicated, the sentence was justified and the appeal was dismissed. He will be eligible for parole on August 1. Tinder date: Gable Tostee (pictured) says he did not murder Warriena Wright,following their meeting via the mobile dating app Tinder in Cavill Mall, Surfers Paradise, then on to his nearby high rise apartment . Tragic death: Warriena Wright (pictured) fell to her death from the 14th floor of Gable Tostee's Surfers Paradise apartment in the early hours of August 8 this year, just days before the 26-year-old was due to return home to New Zealand . Before Tostee was sent back to prison in February, his  barrister Peter O’Connor argued he was 'terrified' of returning to prison as he was ‘brutalised’ in a Queensland jail last year. In successfully arguing for bail last November, Mr Tostee said he had been targeted by criminals in prison and that he feared for his safety. During hearings last year for his murder case, prosecutors said Tostee's alleged actions in locking 26-year-old victim Warriena Wright outside on a 14th floor balcony were akin to locking someone in a trunk to suffocate. Justice  Mullins told the court the case 'is not in any view a straightforward case of murder'. Mr Tostee was arrested a week after Ms Wright's death. Following the first, adjourned part of his bail hearing, Tostee replaced his original legal team with renowned Queensland civil liberties lawyer, Terry O'Gorman. The Avalon apartments (above) in Surfers Paradise on Queensland's Gold Coast were the scene of the fatal fall by Warriena Wright 14 storeys to the ground at around 2.20am on August 8 this year . Tostee's lawyerssaid that while he was in prison, he was 'always on guard' against fellow inmates. Ms Wright died at around 2.20am, just hours after meeting Mr Tostee at Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise via the mobile dating app Tinder. Mr Tostee denies he murdered Ms Wright. Mr Tostee appointed Mr O'Gorman following the civil libertarian's comments about the release of court documents including an alleged transcript of Ms Wright's night with him, taped on his phone, and a damning police affidavit of what occurred between the two in the hours before Ms Wright's death. Strict conditions: Gable Tostee was living at his parents, Gary and Helene's house (pictured) while on bail,before he was returned for another lagging behind the bars of a Queensland prison . Fatal meeting: Warriena Wright (above, left) was holidaying on the Gold Coast after attending a friend's wedding, when the 26-year-old New Zealand bank clerk fell to her death from Gable Tostee's (above, right) high rise balcony apartment . Devastated: Warriena Wright (above, right) with sister, Reza, who was devastated by the death . The prosecution claims Tostee has a ‘bizarre indifference to Ms Wright's death’ and that she had been affected on the night of her death by alcohol in the form of a ‘white spirit’ made by him. Justice Mullins has made mention during the hearing of the accused’s autism and social anxiety. Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden told that hearing Mr Tostee was unlikely to have been on the balcony when Ms Wright plunged 14 storeys to her death. Justice Mullins described the Crown prosecutor's case for murder as 'weak' and 'difficult', but said a case of manslaughter would be 'strong'. Justice Mullins said a diagnosis of autism for Gable Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his Surfers Paradise apartment on the night Ms Wright died. 'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' she told Mr Tostee's defence, 'but in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.'

"Dramatic pictures have emerged of a woman being rescued from her car which had become submerged in flood waters following Saturday afternoon's severe storms. The woman was one of two people that had become trapped in rising waters at Zetland in Sydney's inner-east, that was spotted by the same police rescue squad officer on his way to work. She was helped out of the vehicle by the officer and his co-worker at about 6.30pm and did not suffer any injuries. Superintendent Paul Johnston from Fire and Rescue NSW told Daily Mail Australia that the incident was just one of many flash flooding rescues that emergency services had attended from 4pm. 'At the height of the storm we had two hundred calls in the system, mostly about flooding in people' homes and businesses, rescues from flash flooding - in the inner city they're not as dangerous because people are just trapped in their cars and not at risk of being swept away - and automatic fire alarms,' Supt Johnston said. The second round of wild weather in New South Wales came after just two days of clear skies and transformed parts of Sydney and the Blue Mountains into snowfields. Marble-sized hailstones pummelled multiple suburbs in the city's east and west on Saturday evening, coating streets and backyards in sleet despite only lasting from about 4pm until 7pm. Blackheath residents in the Blue Mountains, about 100km west of Sydney, reported hailstones up to 2cm in size, while social media users shared surreal images of snowmen and even snowboarders on the streets of Sydney. Seven buildings collapsed in western Sydney after suffering damage from the storm, with Fire and Rescue crews expected to work through the night to assess the damage. Scroll down for video .

'These are very large factories, around 200m long, and we've had another two building collapses within a kilometre radius. 'There are 20 trucks and 100 firefighters on the scene now.' The factories were believed to have been mostly empty at the time of the collapse, with only seven people evacuated. No injuries have been reported, however police and ambulance are still investigating at the scene. Sue Pritchard, a spokesperson for the State Emergency Services, told Daily Mail Australia that an 80m by 100m wall had also collapsed nearby at Eastern Creek, where Fire and Rescue NSW and the Rural Fire Service were attending the scene. 'We've had over 800 jobs state wide since 4pm and we've also had one flood rescue,' Ms Pitchard added. 'They have mainly been in Mount Druit, Marrickville and Randwick areas as the storms have come through. 'There's been a lot of hail causing leaking roofs and roof damage. There's meant to be more windy weather about tomorrow, so we're asking people to be proactive and check their properties to make sure nothing can be blown about and secure anything that is loose.'

A statement from the SES on Saturday night added: 'Strong winds are expected tomorrow in parts of Western Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury. 'With the recent heavy rains the ground is saturated meaning it is more likely that trees may fall. The winds may also blow around any inadequately secured items such as tarping, storm debris or loose roof sheeting from the storms earlier in the week.'

"A patient is being treated for suspected rabies in a Northern Ireland hospital. The Public Health Agency (PHA) confirmed the person had recently travelled in an area affected by the disease. They are being assessed in accordance with the 'national risk assessment protocol' at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, the PHA added. A patient at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast is being tested for suspected rabies . Lisa McMurray died at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, in 2009 after contracting rabies while working in South Africa . 'The patient is currently being treated in the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, and is being tested for a number of diseases including rabies,' said a spokeswoman. The results of the 'complex' series of tests are not expected to be known until early next week. The PHA refused to reveal any details about the patient, including their gender, age or their condition. Transmission is generally through the bite of an infected animal, usually dogs, but also cats, bats and other wildlife. In the UK, the viral infection that attacks the brain and nervous system has been largely eliminated from the animal population. The NHS website states infections are mostly picked up during travel abroad and are almost always fatal unless early treatment is received. Animal career Lisa McMurray died at the same Belfast hospital in 2009 after contracting rabies. It was thought she contracted the infection while working at an animal sanctuary in South Africa. Ms McMurray had told friends she had been injured while separating two fighting dogs. Today the PHA said  there was no increased risk to the wider community as a result of the latests possible case. They stressed that a course of rabies vaccination could prevent infection. Rabies can spread to humans from infected animals through a bite, a scratch, or a lick to broken skin or the eye. You may also be at risk if an animal spits in your face. In very rare cases, rabies can be spread during an organ transplant. Once it enters the body, the rabies virus multiplies before spreading into nerve endings. It then travels to the spinal cord and brain (the central nervous system). Once the virus is in the central nervous system, it multiplies rapidly and spreads to the salivary glands, lungs, kidneys and other organs. Symptoms include high temperature, fear of water, and sensitivity to light. Rabies is almost always fatal unless treated very early.

"Mexican prosecutors have launched an investigation of possible criminal conduct in the case of a 14-year-old girl mistakenly sent to the U.S. to live with a woman who claimed to be her mother, authorities said Friday. Alondra Luna Nunez was mistakenly flown to Texas on April 16 after a judge in the western state of Michoacan ruled in favor of a Houston woman who believed she was her daughter. She was returned to her family in Mexico on Wednesday after DNA testing in the United States showed she was not the long-missing daughter of Houston resident Dorotea Garcia. Scroll down for video . Reunited: Alondra Luna Nunez (pictured) was mistakenly flown to Texas on April 16 after a judge in the western state of Michoacan ruled in favor of a Houston woman named Dorotea Garcia who believed she was her daughter . The Prosecutor's Office in the southwestern state of Michoacan said in a statement that it is looking into the case involving a civil court judge in Los Reyes, including media reports and videos that 'suggest probable acts against the child's best interests and could constitute an illegal action'. Video footage of Alondra being taken screaming by police circulated widely and attracted national and international attention to the case. The National Human Rights Commission has launched its own investigation, which its president Luis Raul Gonzalez said would seek to ensure that there is 'no impunity' in the case. After landing home on Wednesday, Alondra seemed to hold no grudge, saying she hoped Garcia, ended up finding her daughter. They spoke by phone. Taken: Alondra Luna Nunez's case drew international attention after a video of her being forced into a police vehicle last week appeared online . Struggle: Alondra used every ounce of her energy to fight Mexican federal police officers, who were working for Interpol on the orders of a Texas judge . 'She told me to forgive her for everything she had done to us,' Alondra told reporters. Alondra had asked for DNA tests in Mexico before she was sent to the United States, and her parents presented more than a dozen documents including her baptismal records, family photographs and a copy of her birth certificate. But Judge Cinthia Elodia Mercado ruled Alondra was in fact Alondra Diaz Garcia, who was taken from Texas by her father in 2007. Garcia thought Luna was her daughter because they share a similar scar between their eyebrows. The other girl remains missing and the father's whereabouts are also unknown. Elodia Mercado said this week that it was not within her authority to order DNA testing, and she was obligated to ensure Mexico followed international conventions on child abductions. 'We, as judges, are only responsible to resolve the case with respect to recovering the minor,' she said. 'We don't do investigations or make inquiries.' Mexico's National Human Rights Commission also announced it had requested reports from a half dozen government entities to conduct its own inquiry into whether Alondra's human rights were violated. Reunited: Alondra is seen with her father, little brother and mother after she was reunited with her family when a DNA test proved she was not the daughter of the Houston woman . Long-lost daughter: Dorotea Garcia (pictured) believed that Alondra Nunez was her long-lost daughter Alondra, who was taken to Mexico by her father in 2007 . Similarities? Dorotea never stopped looking for her daughter Alondra Diaz Garcia - seen here before she was taken as (right) in a digitally aged picture . It added that its officers had interviewed Alondra's father and offered medical and psychological help for the girl and the family, and said it would study whether procedures for handling such cases should be reformed. 'If there are holes or gaps in the protocol, these must be corrected to prevent future human rights violations that harm girls, boys and adolescents,' the commission said in a statement.

"Some of us don't like to hit the bar before midday, but when your drink is poured by a robot bartender you make an exception - even when mine jerks suddenly and I fear a malfunction.

The Bionic Bar is among many hi-tech gimmicks on board the 4,180-passenger Anthem Of The Seas, Royal Caribbean's second Quantum-class liner, which last week set sail on its maiden voyage. Passengers have rubber wristbands fitted with electronic chips, which can be pressed against various sensors. I use mine as a room key, to make payments and to check my itinerary on handy tablets around the ship. The 375 interior staterooms also have sea views from virtual balconies — window-sized LED screens showing real-time footage shot by exterior cameras. This ship is clearly aimed at younger cruisers. The indoor SeaPlex activity area (the largest of its kind at sea) has bumper cars, a roller disco and circus school. There's also an observation capsule (another first), which swoops out over the ship, a FlowRider wave machine for surfing and body­ boarding, and RipCord by iFLY - a vertical wind tunnel for skydiving at sea.

"The historical city of Istanbul is usually captured through photographs of its picturesque mosques, elaborate palaces and winding streets and markets. However it is the ultimate city of contrasts, with vibrant developments springing up in the middle of the old Turkish city. Architect and photographer Yener Torun sought to challenge the one dimensional view of his changing city, and captures the new, minimalistic buildings that add a splash of colour to Istanbul. Architect and photographer Yener Torun sought to challenge the one dimensional view of the changing city of Istanbul . Yener spends his time wandering around the city looking for bold, geometric buildings to photograph, and documents his work to his Instagram, which has over 50,000 followers. The photographer, who has lived in Istanbul for 14 years, aims to show a clean minimalistic view of the city, as it contrasts with the ornate, Ottoman architecture. 'Istanbul is mystical and historic but it is also a modern city and I believe increasing the variety of aspects provides a better understanding of the city,' the 32-year-old photographer said. 'I decided to look for something different and started searching less ornate, simpler, modern lines of the city. 'I dig every corner of the city and I spend most of my free time looking for them and finding them is like finding an oasis in a desert because Istanbul is quite like a desert of grey buildings.' The photographer captures pictures of the bold, geometric buildings as he walks around the city . There has been an explosion in construction business in Turkey in the last 10 years with many new structures bringing different stylistic approaches. Yener admits that he has to hunt around in order to find the most dramatic and colourful ones. While photographing the colourful balconies of an apartment block, Yener also captures a resident spring cleaning . 'I usually focus on the part of the building I am interested in and crop the rest,' he said. 'Istanbul is eastern and western at the same time. It is historical and ornate but also modern too. 'I have been living here for 14 years and it still finds a new trick to surprise me and I share some of these little surprises on Instagram.' By placing people against the bright background, Yener adds another layer of interest to his Instagram pictures .

"The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are so desperate to rid themselves of Major League Baseball star Josh Hamilton that they might decide to pay almost $70million for him to play for another team. Hamilton, who has a history of substance abuse and admitted to relapsing with drugs and alcohol in February, is going to be sent back to his former team, the Texas Rangers, according to reports. He has been on the disabled list all season after undergoing shoulder surgery on February 4, about the same time he filed for divorce from Real Housewives of Orange County star Katie Hamilton. Scroll down for video . The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are willing to pay almost $70million for Josh Hamilton to play in Texas . Josh Hamilton filed for divorce from his wife, Katie, in late February after they celebrated ten years together . The 33-year-old (pictured) was an All Star during a five-year span with the Texas Rangers from 2008 until 2012 . The 33-year-old outfielder still has about $83million left on the five-year $125million deal he signed with the Angels in 2012. In order for the Angels to rid themselves of Hamiton, they would have to agree to pay out the bulk of the cash remaining on his contract, according to MLB.com. The Rangers are only willing to pay around $15million to Hamilton and do not want to give up any players in a trade with Los Angeles, Sports Illustrated reported. The Angels would effectively be paying $68million for Hamilton to play in Texas. Yahoo MLB columnist Jeff Passan said on Twitter: 'Angels wanted Josh Hamilton gone and are paying ~$65M to make it happen. 'Rangers get a $15M lottery ticket that could be worth much more.' Details of the trade and/or buyout are still being negotiated but an announcement is expected in the next few days unless things fall apart. Hamilton is no longer allowed to see any of his daugthers without supervision, according to court records . If it goes through, the Rangers will happily welcome Hamilton back. Shortstop Elvis Andrus said: 'He is a player who can help everybody. The deal could stall, but Hamilton is likely going back to Texas. He won MVP there in 2010 . 'He is a guy that we know. When he is at his best, we know what he can do. 'It's not the first time something happened with him outside the field. 'We all did a great job here having his back and supporting him. 'As long as he shows up and plays hard, I will always have his back.' Hamilton had been spending the offseason in Houston recovering from surgery to repair the AC joint in his right shoulder when reports began to surface about his drug relapse. He is still rehabbing from the procedure and could return in May. During his time with Texas, Hamilton hit .305 with 142 home runs, 506 RBIs and a .549 slugging percentage . The Rangers are willing to pay around $15million to Hamilton and won't give up any players to Los Angeles . Hamilton filed for divorce from wife Katie in February, around the same time he self-reported a cocaine and alcohol relapse. They married in 2004 and have three daughters together, but court documents show Hamilton is not allowed to see them without supervision. Katie, who will appear on the 10th season of The Real Housewives of Orange County when it airs this summer, has a daughter from a previous relationship. The divorce petition only cited 'conflict' as the reason for the split. The veteran outfielder was suspended for three seasons between 2003-05 for well-documented issues with substance abuse and undergoes regular drug testing as a condition of his reinstatement into baseball in 2005. The slugger beat his early addiction problems and became one of the game's most feared hitters over a five-year span with the Texas Rangers from 2008-12. Hamilton was named an American League All-Star in each of those seasons and captured the AL MVP award in 2010. MLB officials thought Hamilton violated his treatment with the relapse, but the players' association disagreed . The Hamiltons, pictured last year, have not listed the reasons behind their divorce, citing only 'conflict' MLB officials thought Hamilton violated his treatment program with the recent relapse, but the players' association disagreed. After league and union representatives were unable to reach an agreement in the case, an arbitrator was called in. The arbitrator said Hamilton did not violate terms of the agreement, although the reasoning behind the decision was not divulged. Major League Baseball released a statement saying it disagreed with the arbitrator's decision. When the decision was announced, Angels general manager Jerry DiPoto said: 'The Angels have serious concerns about Josh's conduct, health and behavior and we are disappointed that he has broken an important commitment which he made to himself, his family, his teammates and our fans,' 'We are going to do everything possible to assure he receives proper help for himself and for the well-being of his family.' Plagued by injuries last season, Hamilton had only 381 at-bats and posted ten home runs, 44 runs batted in and a .263 batting average. He has a career batting average of .292, has hit as many as 43 home runs in a season (2012) and in 2008 drove in a league-leading 130 runs. During his time with the Rangers, Hamilton batted .305 with 142 home runs, 506 RBIs and a .549 slugging percentag .","Los Angeles Angels are close to deal sending outfielder to Texas Rangers .

"Onlookers have described the horrifying moment they saw a surfer being mauled by a 'monster' Great White shark on South Australia's west coast. The man has been identified by the Adelaide Advertiser as Chris Blowes. The 26-year-old is currently fighting for his life in hospital. Mr Blowes was surfing about 350 metres offshore near Right Point on the south-western side of Fishery Bay in Port Lincoln National Park, when he was attacked at 9.45am on Saturday. Mr Blowes was out in the surf with about a dozen others when she 'massive' shark struck. Shocked witnesses recall seeing what they believed was a six-metre great white shark swimming away with the surfer's leg and a surfboard in its jaw. 'The shark came in and bit his leg off and the guys helped him in and carried him up the cliff,' said Glenn Lugg, who has been surfing in the area for 25 years. 'I was just watching the shark go out to the ocean with his board still attached. Obviously the shark still had his leg and he was still swimming around with it,' Mr Lugg told Adelaide Now. Scroll down for video . The shark victim was taken to hospital before being airlifted to Adelaide for further treatment on Saturday . Mr Lugg was told to call an ambulance while his fellow surfers pulled Mr Blowes from the water, up the beach on a surfboard and into a car to take the 26-year-old to hospital. The shocked witness said the experience was 'pretty traumatic', but that everyone involved did a great job. A friend of Mr Blowes, Ty Swan, described the 26-year-old as a 'good bloke', and that he had been bitten in the middle of the thigh. Mr Swan placed a sign at the popular tourist beach to let others know of the attack. Another witness, who was surfing at the time, told Daily Mail Australia that 'there was blood everywhere'. The injured man was initially taken to Port Lincoln Hospital with life-threatening injuries but been been airlifted to Adelaide for further treatment. Shocked witnesses said after the attack, which took place at Fishery Bay, South Australia, the six-metre shark was seen swimming away with the surfer's leg in its mouth . The man was airlifted to Adelaide for further treatment after he was bitten by a shark . Another man said those closest to the badly injured surfer acted quickly without any thought of danger to themselves. 'I was just watching the shark go out to the ocean with his board still attached,' another witness told the Sunday Mail. 'Obviously the shark still had his leg and he was still swimming around with it.' The man said even though he was 50 metres from the shark, he could see its 'massive' pectoral fin - and he had no doubts it was a great white shark, the most feared creature in the sea. However details of the type of shark and the man's injuries have not been released or confirmed. Surfer is in a critical condition after being attacked by a shark in Fishery Bay, Port Lincoln, in South Australia . Fishery Bay is on South Australia's west coast, which is about seven hours from Adelaide . Witnesses have described the horrifying moment that saw the man being mauled by a Great White shark . After the shark victim had been brought ashore and carried up a slope to a parking area, he was loaded into a car. The man, who remains in a critical condition, has been airlifted via a MedSTAR retrieval team to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for further treatment. Police were working with Fisheries officials, the local council and Surf Life Saving SA to post signs on the beach warning others promptly after the shark attack. The attacked happened during conditions that police and marine experts have previously said are dangerous. The overcast conditions make it difficult for surfers to see sharks that might be in the area and it is believed that sharks often mistake humans for seals or dolphins. The incident comes after surfer Jake Heron managed to fight off a four metre Great White at the same beach 10 years ago which attacked him just 10 metres from shore by punching and kicking it . He escaped with 20 stitches in his arm and 40 stitches in his thigh. Jake Heron was mauled by a four-metre Great White in 2005 . Wildcatch Fisheries SA chairman Jonas Woolford said the number of shark sightings in the area had risen recently. 'There has been a number of sightings just recently actually at a number of locations along the coast near to Fishery Bay, just around the corner, the sightings have said that the sharks have been rather aggressive actually,' Mr Woolford told the ABC. 'It's been reported that there hasn't been many for about 10 or so weeks, so whether those ones that have been laying low are now coming back to the areas which they normally frequent and they may be rather hungry ... but yes, there has been more sightings around just recently.'","A man is in a critical condition after a shark attack in South Australia .

"A Hawaiian fisherman is missing again, just a few months after surviving 12 days lost at sea. Ron Ingraham, 67, spent almost two weeks adrift and surviving on raw fish after getting caught in an enormous storm on Thanksgiving. He eventually managed to radio for help and was rescued - but as of Friday Ingraham is missing again, in potentially even more danger than before. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, his ship ran aground on rocks around a mile west of Hawaii's Lanai island. Rescue the first: Ron Ingraham is pictured above in December being welcomed aboard a Navy destroyer after 12 days stranded at sea. He is missing again . Recovery: Pictured above is the sailing boat Ingraham had got lost in, which was towed back to shore by his rescuers . His sailing mate, Kenny Corder, was thrown into the water with him, and the two were clinging to a life ring to survive. Corder, who was rescued and taken to hospital, said that he left Ingraham with the ring to swim backed to the damaged ship and radio for help. By the time he returned, he said, there was no sign of Ingraham - and Coast Guard officials are still looking for him. The Coast Guard notified Ingraham's son in Missouri, Zakary Ingraham, said the son's wife, Katie Jarrett. 'This is absolutely insane,' she said. Long-lost: Pictured above in Ingraham's son, Zakary. The two hadn't spoken in more than 15 years when he went missing the first time . Ingraham and his son had not spoken for years, but news of his improbably rescue in December brought the two back together. He was considered lost after a search triggered by a Mayday message saying he was about to sink did not help authorities track him down. During a routine trip from Molokai island, where he lives, to Lanai, where he often fishes, a huge storm knocked out his engine and pummeled his boat with 20-foot waves. 'I lived off the moisture off the fish I caught,' Ingraham said. 'Mentally, physically and spiritually, I got my butt kicked.' Eventually he got weak and assumed he would die - and friends had already planned his funeral. Man and the sea: This file photo shows Ingraham at sea years ago. His boat ran aground on rocks Friday - his second major difficulty in less than six months . The Coast Guard launched a massive search and he was thought to be dead, until he was able to use a wire hanger to get a signal sent from his battered radio. That led to his rescue by crew members on the guided-missile destroyer USS Paul Hamilton. Meanwhile, another man was also missing from a separate boat around Hawaii after he reported Thursday his vessel was flooding about 10 miles south of Honolulu Harbor. The Coast Guard searched overnight for the mariner who was aboard the vessel Kolea and then suspended the search on Friday afternoon.","Ron Ingraham, 67, disappeared off Hawaiian coast on Thanksgiving .

"A bakery in Oregon has been told to pay $135,000 to a lesbian couple that it refused to make a wedding cake for two years ago. An administrative law judge said that Sweet Cakes by Melissa, in the Portland suburb of Gresham, discriminated against Rachel Bowman-Cryer and her wife Laurel and caused them emotional suffering. Melissa Klein and her husband Aaron refused to make the couple, who held a commitment ceremony in June 2013, a cake after learning that they were lesbians in January of that year because they disapprove of gay marriage for religious reasons. The Kleins were able to raise more than $100,000 from anonymous donors on a fundraising page before it was shut down for violating GoFundMe's terms of service. Melissa Klein (behind counter) of Sweet Cakes by Melissa faces a $135,000 fine after being found guilty of discriminating against a lesbian couple when she and her husband refused to make them a wedding cake . Rachel Bowman-Cryer (right) and her wife Laurel (left) file a civil rights lawsuit and said that they had suffered emotional distress because of the case after they received death threats . The judge's Friday verdict comes after the Bowman-Cryers filed a civil rights suit in the case, which has joined a series of similar proceedings in a national debate about anti-LGBT discrimination and religious freedom. They said during compensation hearings that they had received death threats and were worried about losing their two foster children after the case received widespread attention, according to Oregon Live. Oregon prohibits businesses from discriminating based on sexual orientation and the Christian bakers are were found guilty of discrimination earlier this year. The bakery must pay up to $150,000, and the judge's Friday decision of $135,000 will be approved or amended by State Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian. A ruling issued by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries saying that the Kleins discriminated also rejected their argument that she did not discriminate against the couple because she had previously sold Rachel Cryer a cake for her mother's wedding. Melissa Klein and her husband Aaron (right), who closed their bakery in 2013 amid attention to the discrimination case, say they are in dire financial straits because of the fine . An administrative law court in Oregon ruled earlier this year against the Klein's defense that their constitutional right to expression of their religious beliefs superseded Oregon state law against discrimination . The Kleins, who closed their store in 2013 amid attention drawn to the discrimination and now operate it from their home, have said that they and their five children are struggling financially. 'This is real money that Aaron and Melissa are going to have to pay that otherwise would be used to pay their mortgage and feed their kids,' their lawyer Anna Harmon told the Oregonian. The bakery's Facebook page posted a message Friday saying that the fine 'will financially ruin us'. A GoFundMe page for the family has already raised $101,000 as of Friday night. The page, which has set its goal at $200,000, says that any excess funds will be given to 'will be used to cover those same expenses for others who defend their constitutional right to live consistently with their faith.' However, the fundraising site later shut down the couple's page for violating the company's terms of service. 'The subjects of the ""Support Sweet Cakes By Melissa"" campaign have been formally charged by local authorities and found to be in violation of Oregon state law concerning discriminatory acts. Accordingly, the campaign has been disabled,' the site told Go Local PDX. The Klein's said that 'Satan's really at work' after 'he administrators of gofundme because they claimed it was raising money for an illegal purpose'. The family will still receive the $100,000 they raised, though it is now urging potential donors to give them money on a fundraising site run by Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham. A lawyer for the Bowman-Cryers said Friday about the $135,000 amount that 'This is a proposed order and we view this matter as continuing to be active litigation', refusing to comment further. The case follows similar incidents in Colorado, where a Christian baker who refused to bake a wedding reception cake for a gay couple was found to have discriminated against them in 2013. The Bowman-Cryers said they were worried about losing their foster children, who they have since adopted, after attention was brought to their marriage. Oregon began allowing same sex marriage in May 2014 . A GoFundMe page for the bakery started Friday afternoon raised more than $100,000 in eight hours for the Klein's legal expenses . Another baker in the state who refused to bake cakes with Bible quotes and anti-gay messages was found not to have discriminated the Christian customer earlier this year. Indiana passed a law that many saw as allowing businesses to discriminate against LGBT people earlier this year, though it has since amended it to say that discrimination is not allowed. A pizza parlor in the state that said it would deny service to gay couples raised more than $840,000 from donors online after it closed following backlash on social media for its decision. A CNN poll taken last week found that 57 per cent of Americans think that wedding-related businesses such as cake bakers should not be allowed to deny service to same sex couples. Oregon has allowed gay marriage since 2014, when its ban was struck down by a federal court for violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Bownman-Cryers married in May that year, shortly after the judge's decision, according to the Statesman Journal. They have since adopted their foster children, two daughters aged eight and six. The state's law on discrimination against gay people makes exceptions for religious institutions such as schools and churches.","Sweet Cakes by Melissa in Oregon found to have discriminated against lesbian couple by refusing them wedding cake in January 2013 .

"Arrogant: Violent robber Lynch posing for a jail selfie . Staring cockily at the camera, violent robber Craig 'Lazie' Lynch shows off his toned physique in a series of audacious self-portraits taken in his prison cell – from where he is said to be earning a fortune by running illegal websites. Lynch is serving nine years for a series of violent gang robberies, including one in which a knife was held to a terrified father's throat in front of his family. Use of computers, social media and mobile phones is strictly forbidden behind bars. Yet, as this picture and his posts show, Lynch has been free to run a sneering Facebook site from his cell in Bedford Prison. And, according to a former friend, he is using it to make huge profits from websites selling legal highs. The friend, now disgusted with Lynch and the 'lax attitude' of the prison authorities, told The Mail on Sunday the bearded criminal has become a 'self-made millionaire earning so much tax-free money behind bars he has invested in properties in Cyprus, Ireland and Spain and a fleet of luxury cars'. Lynch, 34, is in constant communication with more than 400 'friends', poking fun at British justice and bragging about using an iPhone and a Samsung Galaxy. He updates social media feeds with 'selfies' and photos of takeaway meals – and reports how he has had a tattoo, drinks vodka, plays online games and has a personal gym trainer. 'He should be in prison as a punishment, not living it up,' said the former friend. 'He's arrogant, resourceful, and owns properties overseas and UK-based businesses. 'Incredibly, this is all through crime, run on Facebook while in prison.' This is not the first time Lynch – who has appeared in court 22 times for 66 offences – has used Facebook to taunt the authorities. In 2009 he used the site to goad police after vanishing from Hollesley Bay Prison, Suffolk, where he was serving a seven-year sentence for aggravated burglary. He was recaptured in January 2010. He was later released but in August last year he was found guilty of robbery and sent back to prison – and once again began posting from his cell on Facebook. Claiming he studies 'Advanced criminology at University of Crime', he even uses Facebook to advertise for people to work for him. In one post he offers: '£250 an hour, three hours a week. Only the sinister to apply. Easy work. No crime.' Contraband items are often smuggled into jails or thrown over the walls. The former friend also believes Lynch was behind an attempt in March to fly contraband goods into the prison using a drone, which was discovered in netting above the perimeter wall – as reported in The Mail on Sunday. A parcel attached to the drone contained drugs, a phone, a blade and screwdrivers. The source said: 'Lynch posted a cutting from a newspaper report about the find and wrote, 'No comment…' It was his way of bragging he was behind it. 'He is making a fortune selling contraband inside, such as phones and legal highs, as well as his earnings from the websites, all tax-free. 'Yet the authorities seem to look the other way.' The Ministry of Justice said last night that any prisoners using mobile phones would face disciplinary action.

"A Mississippi Senator's personal assistant has been charged with trafficking drugs from China to use as payment for sexual favors. Police launched an investigation after seizing a package on April 9 with over a kilo of the date rape drug GBL addressed to  Fred Pagan, office manager and personal assistant to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS). Raiding his home on Thursday, they uncovered 181.5 grams of meth. Senator: Thad Cochran (R-MS) has yet to comment on the fact that his personal assistant and office manager Fred Pagan has been charged with trafficking drugs, including methamphetamine, from China . Pagan was paid $160,000 in his Senate role last year, the Washington Post reports. The paper states Pagan, 49, has worked for Cochran since he was 16 years old. He is charged with one count of possession and intent to distribute methamphetamine and one count of importing a controlled substance. The former is punishable by five to 40 years in prison, the latter by up to 20. Pagan was released on Friday after an initial court appearance. He will appear again on May 14. Court documents read by The Washington City Paper say Pagan admits he acquired three loads of drugs through a dealer. He is accused of buying the substances to exchange for sexual favors. Sen Cochran's spokesman Chris Gallegos confirmed a staff member had been arrested but refused to confirm further details. He told the City Paper: 'Our office is in the process of consulting with Senate legal counsel.' GBL, the drug Cochran allegedly acquired from a dealer in China, is similar to the date rape drug GHB. It is illegal to manufacture or sell either variant of the drug in the United States. Users can face two years in prison, suppliers up to 14 years. The drug, which is in liquid form, is packaged is select types of plastic as it is said to burn through many normal types of packaging.","Fred Pagan, personal assistant to Sen Thad Cochran (R-MS), is charged with possession and intent to supply meth, plus trafficking drugs .

"Next summer there will be a new ship in the Thomson fleet – but it will be familiar to seasoned cruisers who have sailed on Royal Caribbean’s Splendour of the Seas. The mid-size ship, with an on-board climbing wall, is sailing away from RCI to Thomson and will get a new name, yet to be announced. So many newly constructed floating resorts come out of shipyards these days – Britannia, Anthem of the Seas and Norwegian Escape all this year – and it is good news that tried and tested, smaller ships built on classic lines do not just sail off into the sunset or to the breaker’s yard, but are reinvented and relaunched, sometimes several times over. What will it be next? The Splendour of the Seas will be transformed by Thomson, and launched under a new name next summer . Take Magellan, ‘new flagship’ of the Cruise & Maritime fleet, recently christened in Tilbury. Magellan started life as the Holiday, built in 1985 for Carnival Cruise Lines. It has had a colourful life, including providing a haven for victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and acting as a hotel for the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014. It is hard to believe that luxurious little Hebridean Princess, chartered by the Queen for her 80th birthday family cruise around Scotland in 2006, was the busy car ferry and Royal Mail ship MV Columba for 25 years from its launch in 1964 until transformed in 1989 into the country-house hotel-style cruise ship she is today. Her former sister ship, the 98-passenger Hebridean Spirit, was sold off in 2009, amid rumours she was to become a private yacht. Three years later she reappeared, refitted for 114 passengers as Caledonian Sky for Noble Caledonia. Before: The cruise ship MS Grand Holiday of Carnival Cruise Lines docked in Nice along the French Riviera . After: The renamed and renovated Magellan, a new flagship of Cruise & Maritime Voyages . Then there’s P&O’s smallest ship, the 700-passenger Adonia. She was built in 2001 as ‘R8’ – the last of eight ‘Renaissance Class’ ships. The ship became Minerva II for Swan Hellenic, serving the company for four years, then she was Royal Princess for Princess Cruises. She became Adonia in 2011, named by Shirley Bassey in Southampton. Some of Adonia’s similar sisters are now Azamara Journey, Azamara Quest, Pacific Princess and Ocean Princess. Meanwhile, Swan Hellenic has operated the same ship twice. The first Minerva, built in 1989, was originally intended as a Soviet spy vessel. She sailed for the one-ship cultural cruises company, accommodating 350 passengers, from 1996 until 2003, when, to the dismay of her loyal passengers (known as the Swans), she was replaced by Minerva II, with her 650 berths. Before: The luxury cruise ship Hebridean Spirit moored in Ermoupoli, Greek island of Syros . After: Now transformed into Noble Caledonia MS Island Sky cruise ship, sailing out of in Portsmouth Harbour . To the Swans’ joy, the more intimate Minerva returned to Swan Hellenic in 2008 and was given a multi-million-pound makeover during 2011. Quintessentially British line Fred.Olsen has just four ships, Balmoral, Black Watch, Boudicca and Braemar. They are all pre-loved and characterful and have been refurbished and even ‘stretched’ in the case of Balmoral. The ship, built in 1988 and previously owned by Norwegian Cruise Lines as Norwegian Crown, grew by 100ft, with 93 cabins added when she was added to the Fred.Olsen fleet in 2007. Before: P&O's smallest cruise ship, Adonia, sails along Southampton Water . After: Adonia became Minverva II for Swan Hellenic, serving the company for four years, and then she was Royal Princess for Princess Cruises .","Next summer Thomson will launch the transformed Royal Caribbean’s Splendour of the Seas as the new ship in their fleet .

"A dismembered body discovered at a flat in Wales has been identified as Tracey Woodford, police said, as a man was arrested over her murder. The 47-year-old is believed to have been attacked in woodland in Pontypridd on Tuesday before being taken back to the property of a man she is thought to have left a town centre pub with, officers said. Her body was discovered with 'massive injuries' around 3pm on Friday afternoon, prompting police to launch a murder investigation. A man named locally as Christopher May, 50, has been arrested. Police confirmed yesterday they had been given an extra 36 hours to question the suspect. Scroll down for video . A dismembered body discovered at a flat in Wales has been identified as Tracey Woodford (above) who has been missing since Tuesday, police revealed . Ms Woodford was last seen by her family at around 12.45pm on April 21 in Rhydyfelin. She was reported missing the next day and her body was discovered after police received information she was with a man at the Skinny Dog pub for around two hours that night and left the premises with him. A police spokesman said: 'Police officers then visited the suspect's address and, following a search of the property, discovered a body. The suspect was arrested on suspicion of murder. 'A 50-year-old man remains in police custody and is assisting police with our enquiries.' After discovering the body police cordoned off an area surrounding nearby Pontypridd Rugby Club's Sardis Road stadium and officers were seen searching the undergrowth. At least four South Wales Police vans and one helicopter took part in the operation, prompting speculation from local residents. Detective Superintendent Paul Hurley described the events surrounding Ms Woodford's death as 'tragic'. In a press conference he said: 'The events have had a profound effect on her family and the wider community, especially given the harrowing circumstances of her death. Her body was discovered with 'massive injuries' at the property (above) yesterday afternoon, prompting police to launch a murder investigation .

'There are well established communities in the South Wales Valleys. I know those communities will rally around Tracey’s family.' He added that police want to speak to anybody who thinks they may have information that can help the investigation. They are particularly interested in those who noticed anything suspicious near Andrews Court, Rickards Street, or near the rugby ground. 'No matter how insignificant the information may seem, we would like people to contact us,' he said. 'We have a team of detectives and the support of specialist resources working on this inquiry and while we understand it will alarm the community, this is an isolated incident and we do have somebody in custody.' Police have cordoned off an area surrounding Pontypridd Rugby Club, near to where the body was found . Neighbours at the flat complex are shocked at the latest updates. One said: 'It is just too shocking to think about. You dread to think about that poor woman and what she went through.' Another added: 'Tracey had her problems over the years but she was loved by her family. 'No-one deserves to die like this. It doesn’t bear thinking about.' Reverend Michael Gable, a local vicar, also paid tribute. A 50-year-old man was arrested after police found the body at a property in Pontypridd. Above, an officer and a sniffer dog search nearby . Police are now appealing for anyone with information to come forward. Above, an officer near the scene . He said: 'It's a tragic situation. The community will be upset and concerned by this news.

"The hospital where the royal baby is due to be born was forced to close one of its wards after patients contracted a mutant superbug, it has emerged. A surgical unit at St Mary's Hospital, London, has not accepted new patients in more than a week after eight were found to be carrying carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae, or CPE. The antibiotic-resistant bacteria can cause potentially fatal infections in the bloodstream and urine. If all goes to plan, the Duchess of Cambridge hopes to have her baby at the private Lindo Wing of the hospital, where her first child, Prince George, was born in 2013. A ward at the hospital where the royal baby is due to be born has been closed after patients contracted a superbug, it has been reported. Left, the mother-to-be last month, and the royal couple last week . The Zachary Cope Ward was closed on April 15 when eight patients were found to be carrying CPE, a spokeswoman for for Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust told MailOnline. Of these patients, three developed localised infections that required treatment. All have since recovered. The 20-bed unit, which specialises in vascular surgery, is now undergoing a deep cleaning and patients continued to be screened for the bacteria. CPE can live harmlessly in the gut and does not need to be treated. But they can cause potentially fatal infections if they enter the wrong part of the body, such as the blood stream or urine. A 20-bed surgical unit at St Mary's Hospital, London, has not been accepting new admissions for more than a week after a number of patients were found to be suffering from CPE. Above, the exclusive Lindo Wing . The ward, which specialises in vascular surgery, is on the eighth floor of a building that is across the road from the exclusive Lindo Wing where the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth. There is no suggestion the bacteria could spread to other areas of the hospital. A spokeswoman for the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust said: 'A ward at St Mary’s Hospital is temporarily not taking new admissions after we found that a small number of vascular patients were carrying a microorganism in their gut. 'Unfortunately three of these patients developed localised infections. All have completely recovered from their infections.' The hospital is screening other patients on the ward to check for infections. The unit is expected to reopen early next week.

"Taylor Swift and rumored boyfriend Calvin Harris spotted together after watching the band HAIM perform at Troubadour Club in West Hollywood . Were a record company to write a job description for the next big thing in popular music, certain attributes would surely be high on the list. Foremost among them, one suspects, would be a decent singing voice, the ability to dance and that elusive brand of charisma which draws crowds of infatuated fans. None of which Calvin Harris possesses. Not that he will be the slightest bit concerned about it. Because he has plenty of reasons for self-confidence. Seventy million of them, in fact. That is the fortune the 31-year-old pop leviathan has amassed since bursting onto the scene eight years ago. No mean feat for an introspective and, by his own admission, curmudgeonly son of a biochemist from the Scottish Borders who less than a decade ago was stacking supermarket shelves to make ends meet. To put it into perspective, his £70 million nest egg eclipses the fortunes of household names such as Kylie Minogue and Sir Cliff Richard. Yet walk into your local pub and it’s a fair bet many people, unless they follow the charts, will never have heard of him. So how has a pasty-faced, gangly geek (he’s 6ft 5in), who decided early in his career to eschew personal publicity altogether, turned into the biggest pop star in Britain? The numbers don’t lie. His earning power is nothing short of breathtaking. Last year alone he earned £45 million. For one night’s work DJ-ing at a party in Puerto Rico, he was reportedly paid $1million. The year before he grossed £30 million, making him comfortably the best paid DJ on the planet, and in the same year his credibility was bolstered by an Ivor Novello award for songwriter of the year. All of this has led to him being named the 21st most powerful celebrity on Forbes magazine’s Celebrity 100, beating the likes of Gordon Ramsay, Simon Cowell and even J.K. Rowling. But the very word ‘celebrity’ flies in the face of everything Calvin Harris stands for. Fans of The X Factor might remember the occasion, in 2009, when the Scot invaded the show’s stage during a performance by the lovably hopeless Irish twins, Jedward. Holding a pineapple on his head, he bent over and pointed at his buttocks — a bizarre performance which he later explained was a protest against the ‘frightening stranglehold that Simon Cowell has got over the entire music chart in the UK at the moment’. Protesting about The X Factor’s obsession with fame, he declared: ‘I’m not a celebrity. I make music.’ This underdog mentality undoubtedly stems from his background. He was born Adam Wiles in 1984 in Dumfries. His father, David, now 72, was the lead biochemist at the local hospital and his mother, Pamela, 65, had been an occupational therapist but became a full-time housewife after Adam was born. DJ Calvin Harris performs onstage in East Rutherford, New Jersey. In 2008 he stormed the stage at an X Factor stage performance to protest what he called the programme's obsession with fame . Two older siblings went on to become, respectively, an IT expert and a marketing executive. Adam, however, was cut from a different cloth. As a teenager, he underwent a dance music epiphany while listening to the radio in his bedroom. But instead of heading out to pursue the rock’n’roll cliche in pubs and clubs, the cerebral young man shut himself in his bedroom, where he built his own studio and spent the next eight years honing the production skills which would make his fortune. Soon his music making had become an obsession. He has said that he so rarely left his room that he experienced a personality change, becoming an anti-social electronic music geek, chained to a keyboard. Calvin Harris at the 2013 Ivor Novello awards held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London . There were stints in bands, but he made an awkward frontman, perpetually hiding behind an oversized pair of sunglasses and resolutely refusing to dance. Nobody was surprised when he gave that up. There were some encouraging signs. An independent record label released a couple of his tunes on vinyl. But he earned more money from the job he took in a fish factory, as well as shelf stacking at Marks & Spencer and Safeway. In 2003, he took a leap of faith and moved to London in an attempt to ‘make it’. He didn’t, and was soon returning north with his tail between his legs. It was back in his bedroom studio that he recorded his first album, I Created Disco, by which time he had rechristened himself Calvin Harris. His salvation, as with so many recent stars, came in the form of social media. Calvin rapidly built a following for his music on MySpace, which brought him to the attention of EMI publishing and later the Sony BMG label. In the blink of an eye he was writing two of the tracks on Kylie Minogue’s comeback album, X. That same year, 2007, he released his debut album, which went gold with more than 100,000 sales. Almost by accident, Calvin had found the solution to his problems: get somebody else, better looking, more famous and with a better voice, to sing his songs instead. So after I Created Disco, he packed up singing and retreated, gratefully, into the background. Since that first collaboration he has worked with anyone and everyone in the business, from popstars Rihanna (their 2011 smash hit We Found Love won him a Grammy) and Katy Perry to the British superstar Ellie Goulding. Even Cheryl Cole owes her biggest hit to Calvin. Along the way, he has released three more albums, all of which have been global smashes. Two years ago, he surpassed Michael Jackson to become the first artist to score nine top-ten hits from a single album. After his I Created Disco album (pictured), he packed up singing and retreated, gratefully, into the background . With such dizzying success it is impossible to keep a low profile for ever, and even Calvin has been affected by the fame juggernaut. It began with a sequence of beautiful girlfriends. Despite his ungainly appearance, he found himself squiring the Russian-American swimwear model Anne Vyalitsyna. Soon he was developing a reputation for becoming involved with his collaborators. Ellie Goulding was an on-off dalliance for years, and he had a year-long relationship with singer Rita Ora, which ended with a Twitter argument. And while success had built Calvin’s confidence, it did nothing to dampen his contrary nature. Twitter spats (he has 5.79 million followers) have become his stock in trade. He has railed at unkind reviewers, ‘rich kids’ ruining the record industry, his tracks being sold for what he regards as derisory prices, and singers whom, he feels, do not treat his creations with sufficient respect. Calvin Harris had made a career working with some of the hottest stars in pop music, including Ellie Goulding (left) and Rihanna (right) All of which paints a less than complimentary picture of a petulant star whose life has changed beyond recognition. Earlier this year, he jettisoned another stunning model, the American Aarika Wolf, in favour of the biggest prize of his dating career, American pop princess Taylor Swift. Miss Swift, a 25-year-old global star who had the top-selling album of 2014 in the U.S., fits the 2015 vintage Calvin to perfection — for since 2013 he’s gone about reinventing himself from the ground up. No longer a the anorak-loving teenager from Dumfries, Harris owns an £11 million mansion in Beverly Hills . That was the year he signed a deal to DJ at the American superclub Hakkasan, taking up a residency in Las Vegas and buying an £11 million mansion in Beverly Hills. In less than a decade he has gone from a nondescript detached house on the Georgetown housing estate just outside Dumfries, to a mansion with ten bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, two swimming pools and a guesthouse so palatial it comes with its own private garage. Such is his earning power, however, this is a drop in the ocean. Last year, he became the first artist to have his music streamed over a billion times on the internet and, at the rate he is going, the DJ will have £250 million in the bank before he hits 40. The Hakkasan gig alone earns him £200,000 a night, while he has been paid many millions more by brands who use his music in advertising campaigns. He has physically changed beyond recognition as well. His once pasty skin is tanned, while endless gym sessions have honed those spindly limbs to lean, muscled perfection. The chest is waxed, the hair and designer stubble coiffed daily by a personal groomer, the teeth whitened and straightened and his wardrobe overhauled by a stylist. The end result of all this has been a contract as the face and body of Emporio Armani. No longer the self-conscious wallflower, he now poses in nothing but a pair of briefs without missing a beat. He became the biggest thing in music by stealth, but the days of Calvin Harris flying under the radar are a thing of the past.","Icon has amassed £77million fortune since rise to fame eight years ago .

"It appears Coca Cola fans are quite an OCD bunch. Used to getting their sweet fix in bottles with colour-coded tops, many like being able to tell whether they're reaching for the 'full fat' regular variety by the red lid on top. But since March the soft drink company has been putting scarlet tops on Diet Coke as well - causing consternation for fans of the zero calorie, zero sugar version. Scroll down for video . Diet Coke bottles like this one now have red lids just like regular Coke - causing a headache for some fans . Coke has switched all the lids on its 500ml bottles to red to 'help make our consumers aware of the full choice available to them within the Coca-Cola range' Fans have taken to Twitter to express their discontent at the changes, which have left many a bit confused . Coke Zero, which is also sugar-free, and the reduced sugar Coke Life varieties also used to have tops with a specific colour, in line with the designs of the labels around the middle. But since March Coca-Cola has made the lids on all of them red, with the aim of bringing all four variants 'together under one brand'. Many drinkers have been left baffled when confronted with the red tops associated with regular Coke on lower calorie and reduced or zero sugar bottles. Charlie Faloona posted on Twitter:  'Why on earth do the new diet coke bottles now have red lids but still a silver wrapper? It doesn't look right'. Helen Smith added: 'Not impressed with the red lids on the diet coke'. Catherine Lightfoot posted: 'Is there a reason why diet coke now have red lids?! Utterly confusing!'

"Ed Miliband was accused of plunging the General Election campaign to a ‘new low’ last night by ‘weaponising dead migrants’. The Labour leader and his party’s spin machine prompted the most bitter row of the campaign so far by suggesting that David Cameron bore personal responsibility for drownings of refugees in the Mediterranean. Senior Conservatives claimed Mr Miliband was effectively ‘accusing the Prime Minister of murder’ in a ‘desperate and negative’ attempt to score political points by exploiting a human tragedy. Ed Miliband, pictured, was accused of trying to make political capital from the Mediterranean tragedy . Ed Miliband claimed the Mediterranean crisis was 'in part a direct result' of the PM's Libya policy . The controversy began after Labour spin doctors issued a briefing note which said Mr Miliband would use a speech on foreign policy to say the ‘tragic scenes’ in the Mediterranean were ‘in part a direct result’ of Mr Cameron’s Libya policy. The Labour leader later insisted he was not saying Mr Cameron had ‘blood on his hands’, but was making a ‘very important point about post-conflict planning in Libya’ after the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi. The Prime Minister said only that Mr Miliband’s remarks were ‘ill- judged’. But a senior Tory source said: ‘A few bad polls for Labour after a poor week of campaigning and Ed Miliband accuses the PM of murder. I think we can see who is getting desperate and running a negative and personal campaign.’ Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg also condemned Labour’s intervention, pointing out that Mr Miliband had backed Western military involvement in Libya. He accused Labour of astonishing hypocrisy, given the catastrophic failure of post-war planning in its Iraq conflict. Mr Clegg told BBC Radio 5 live: ‘I think it is quite distasteful, actually, to reduce this total human tragedy of hundreds of people dying out in the Mediterranean to a political point-scoring blame game, particularly, I have to say, from a party that of course brought us into an illegal invasion in Iraq where there was no planning at all for the aftermath.’ Mr Clegg said there should be ‘a little more adherence to the facts as to who is ending up on these boats, why they are and what we can do about it to stop this terrible human tragedy’. Former foreign secretary William Hague said Mr Miliband’s remarks represented ‘a new low in shallow opportunism’, given that the Labour leader had said ‘nothing’ about foreign policy for five years. Former Tory minister Richard Benyon accused Mr Miliband of ‘weaponising dead migrants’. He said a large percentage of those fleeing North Africa ‘come from other countries than Libya so Miliband is wrong on every level’. And former defence secretary Liam Fox said: ‘Having tried to weaponise the NHS, Miliband is trying to weaponise drowning migrants. It’s quite offensive and reflects extremely badly on both him and his party.’ Mr Miliband, speaking at the Chatham House think-tank in London, was forced to deny that he had ‘politicised’ a tragedy. Former defence secretary Liam Fox said Miliband was trying to 'weaponise drowning migrants' Asked if that was true, Mr Miliband replied: ‘Nonsense. No. Look, what this is about is saying very clearly to the British people that there is a huge issue we face as a country which is learning the lessons of the 2003 Iraq War. ‘The problem is that in relation to Libya we have repeated the mistake because we haven’t done the post-conflict planning. ‘I think people should just read my words and I don’t think anybody in the foreign policy community or in the wider international community would disagree with what I’ve said about the failure of post-conflict planning.’ Labour aides pointed out that Mr Miliband did raise the issue of post-war plans after supporting bombing raids in Libya in 2011. But footage of him also emerged from the same year suggesting the new Libyan authorities should be left to get on with it. ‘This is an important moment to recognise the National Transitional Council and their role in taking Libya forward, and we’ve got to be led by them. It’s very important that Libyans determine their future,’ he said at the time. Labour’s shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker was forced to concede that Mr Cameron is not responsible for migrant deaths in the Mediterranean. ‘Nobody would want to say that the Prime Minister, as a human being, would want to see the terrible things we have seen in the Med,’ he said. In a bruising interview with the BBC’s Andrew Neil, Mr Coaker also struggled to explain when Mr Miliband had raised ‘consistent concerns’ about the issue of post-conflict planning. A senior Labour source said the party ‘did not resile from anything’ in its briefing note and accused critics of a ‘silly, utterly spurious’ response to a ‘serious speech’. Labour accused the Tories of ‘personal attacks’ earlier in the campaign, when Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Miliband ‘stabbed his brother in the back’ in the party’s 2010 leadership contest.","Ed Miliband said the crisis was 'in part a direct result' of the PM's policy .

"David Cameron urged an audience to support West Ham during a speech yesterday - despite the fact he's always claimed to be an Aston Villa fan. The Prime Minister subsequently admitted he'd suffered a 'brain fade' during the election campaign address in Croydon, where he was outlining his vision for black and ethnic minority communities. He said: 'This a country where people of all faiths, all colours, creeds and backgrounds can live together in one place. David Cameron looks a bit sheepish after accidentally urging the audience to support West Ham - though he didn't correct himself until asked about the gaffe afterwards . Last week the Conservative leader tweeted his delight at Villa reaching the FA Cup final by beating Liverpool . 'We are a shining example of a country where multiple identities work. 'A country where you can be Welsh and Hindu and British, Northern Irish and Jewish and British, where you can wear a kilt and a turban, where you can wear a hijab covered in poppies. 'Where you can support Man Utd, the Windies and Team GB all at the same time. 'Of course, I'd rather you supported West Ham.' The Conservative leader was pulled up on the error after the speech, which he read from an autocue, though the party has since admitted it was not included in his prepared text but was an off the cuff remark. It was omitted from the official transcript of his speech issued by the Conservative Party. Cameron blamed his gaffe on a 'brain fade' like that suffered by Green Party leader Natalie Bennett earlier in the campaign. He said: 'I'm a Villa fan ... I must have been overcome by something ... this morning. 'But there we are, these things sometimes happen when you are on the stump.' The two teams do both play in a claret blue colours - albeit in stadiums 130 miles apart. Only last week Cameron tweeted his delight at Villa reaching the FA Cup final by beating Liverpool 2-1 at Wembley. He told the Birmingham Mail: 'It was a tremendous game with [club stars] Benteke and Delph doing Villa proud, against the odds. I can't wait to watch the final at the end of May.' The PM has been a fan since his teens after after he was taken to Villa Park aged 13 by his uncle Sir William Dugdale, who was club chairman from 1975 to 1982. Sir William died last year. The PM has been a Villa fan since his teens and is pictured here during a game against QPR in 2011 . Piers Morgan was one of a number of football fans to lay in to the Prime Minister on Twitter over his error . His error was swiftly seized upon by his political rivals, as the hashtag #villagate began trending on Twitter. Labour's former communications chief Alastair Campbell - whose own team Burnley also play in claret and blue - said the mistake 'says a lot about his character which impacts upon policy. Out of touch. Phoney. Believes nothing.' Campbell said every sports fan would have their 'stomach churning' to hear the PM apparently forget the name of the team he supported, adding: 'I am sorry but this alone means Cameron has to go. Total million percent phoney, as (Villa manager) Tim Sherwood might say.' Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, a fervent Norwich City fan, tweeted: 'Hey David Cameron ... I'm off to see that football team I support this afternoon. Name escapes me ... they play in yellow ... Watford?' But former Conservative press officer Jonathan Collett, a fellow Villa supporter, said he believed the mistake was down to an error in Mr Cameron's speech. 'PM is a passionate Villa fan. Takes son to matches ... Suspect speechwriter error,' said Mr Collett. Soon after the prime minister's gaffe comedian Matt Lucas took to Twitter, creating an amusing new team name. He posted: 'David Cameron just remembered his favourite football team is Weston Villham.' While former England footballer Gary Lineker posted a video of the 'brain fade' and wrote: 'David Cameron has forgotten which Football Club he supports. Aston Villa last week, West Ham this. Burnely next?'. Cameron backed Aston Villa's new manager Tim Sherwood (pictured) to make an impact in the club's bid to stave off Premier League relegation . Nigel Farage also made fun of Cameron, telling PA he not make 'pretences' about football teams he supports and then change them but revealed his son is a Crystal Palace season ticket holder. The UKIP leader said: 'My grandfather was a Crystal Palace supporter, my grandmother was, my eldest son is a season ticket holder, he's there this afternoon, there's a match against Hull today. 'Football's not a big part of my life but I don't make pretences about teams I support and then chop and change them.' When he was first elected to Parliament in 2001, Cameron said he did not follow football, telling the House of Commons in a debate on hooliganism that year: 'Many of those who have spoken in the debate or have written about the subject are either lawyers or football fans, but I have to confess that I am neither.' The first mentions in the national press of his liking for Aston Villa came after he was elected Tory leader in 2005. He was reported in 2006 to have written on his blog that he 'half-heartedly' supported Villa and could name only three of their players. Mr Cameron was asked about the slip-up in an interview with Sky News' Murnaghan to be broadcast tomorrow. Asked to confirm which team he actually supports, he said: 'I've been an Aston Villa fan all my life, I literally opened my mouth and I was going off-piste about the fact that in Britain you can be a supporter of the West Indies, a supporter of Manchester United, and a supporter of Team GB. 'I was then busking about other things you can support and was ... I don't know what happened to me, it was just one of those things.' Former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell, also a fan of a claret coloured team, enjoyed the PM's gaffe . Asked if it was on the script, he said: 'No, it wasn't on the script, I was going off-script to add to the examples, and I suppose it is just the campaign. By the time you have made as many speeches as I have on this campaign all sorts of funny things start popping out of your mouth.' Asked if he remembered watching Aston Villa beat Bayern Munich in the European Cup final as a child, he said: 'I do, that's why I became a Villa fan.' Pressed to say when it was, he replied: 'I'm not doing quiz time because I'll get them all wrong, but that's not what I'm here to talk about. 'That's why I became a Villa fan, because my uncle was involved in the club, and back in the early 80s, with all those successes, and Andy Gray and Brian Little, and that's what got me going. 'But I don't go very often, in fact I haven't been for years and years, but I try and keep up, and I'm hoping we are going to escape the relegation zone, which we're out of now, and obviously the FA Cup final is very exciting.' The Prime Minister' mistake was soon trending on Twitter as #villagate. He blamed it on a 'brain fade' like that suffered by Green Party leader Natalie Bennett earlier in the election campaign . Reminded of his comment in 2001 in the House of Commons that he wasn't actually a football fan, Mr Cameron said: 'I mean, I'm not a regular attender, I used to play football as a kid, my son plays football, and I try and sort of keep up with what's happening in the Premier League and see how Villa are doing. 'But when they get snug in the middle of the table I tend to sort of, I tend to back off a bit. When we get close to the bottom I get nervous, but I don't know what happened this morning.' Asked a final time to name the year Villa won the European Cup (1982), he said: 'It was early eighties. I'm not going to give you a date because I'll get it wrong.' Asked who scored the one goal (Peter Withe), he replied: 'You're wasting your precious interview time.' In February he publically backed new manager Tim Sherwood to make an impact in Villa's efforts to stave off Premier League relegation, saying: 'I am hoping for a couple of Villa gains to lift us out of the danger zone.' He has been pictured at Villa games in the past, including a clash with QPR at Loftus Road in 2011.","Conservative leader was speaking from autocue at Croydon election event .

"The Kansas City Royals and Chicago White Sox each lost Saturday without playing a game. Four members of the Royals and three from the White Sox were punished for their roles in a series-opening brawl and six of the players drew suspensions. Major League Baseball placed the blame for the fighting squarely on both teams. Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura was handed a seven-game suspension, fellow starter Edinson Volquez given five games and outfielder Lorenzo Cain and reliever Kelvin Herrera got two games apiece. White Sox pitchers Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija were suspended five games each, while catcher Tyler Flowers escaped suspension but joined the others in getting an undisclosed fine. Mass brawl: Chicago White Sox's Jeff Samardzija (center) in the brawl with Kansas City Royals players during the seventh inning of Thursday's game. Smardzija and five others have been suspended as a result . All-in: Each player   ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and a few punches . Several punches were thrown and Kansas City's Ventura, Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez were ejected along with Chicago's Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija (pictured going down) The Royals have not said whether they plan to appeal their punishments, which would begin with Sunday's series finale because of a rainout Saturday. Sale and Samardzija plan to appeal. 'I think everybody had some elements of their behavior over the course of that incident on both sides that they wish they handled differently,' White Sox general manager Rick Hahn said during a conference call Saturday. 'Respect the fact that our players stood up and took responsibility for their actions and expressed remorse over those things they wish had been handled better. 'It is something that happens from time to time,' Hahn added. 'It's part of the game.' It's a costly part of the game, though. Along with the suspensions, Hahn said reliever Matt Albers fractured a finger on his throwing hand in the melee and will go on the disabled list. Meanwhile, Herrera is already awaiting an appeal on a five-game suspension that was handed down after he threw a pitch behind Oakland third baseman Brett Lawrie during a series last weekend. Ventura was fined for hitting Lawrie with a 99 mph fastball during the same series. 'We understand that Major League Baseball has to do what they think is fair in situations like this,' Royals manager Ned Yost said in a team statement. 'Now, we just have to wait for the appeals process to play out.' Suspended: Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura (left) was handed a seven-game suspension, fellow starter Edinson Volquez (right) given five games . Punished: Both outfielder Lorenzo Cain (left) and reliever Kelvin Herrera (right) were suspended for two games . White Sox: White Sox pitchers Chris Sale (left) and Jeff Samardzija (right) were suspended five games each . Tensions between the Royals and White Sox had been building since the opening series of the season, when the teams combined to hit six batters. Two more were plunked early Thursday night when Ventura hit Jose Abreu in the fourth inning and Sale hit Mike Moustakas in the fifth. The simmering anger finally boiled over in the seventh, when Ventura snagged a grounder from Chicago outfielder Adam Eaton and the two exchanged words before Eaton was thrown out at first. Eaton had to be restrained from Ventura, who was ejected from his second straight start. 'It was a messy situation,' Ventura said through a translator. Players from both dugouts and bullpens then ran onto the field. Volquez whiffed throwing a haymaker, and several other players threw punches in a fight that lasted several minutes. 'There are real negative repercussions of this,' Hahn said.' After he was thrown from the game, Sale went to the Royals clubhouse and was seen pounding on the door. While nothing more transpired, Hahn said he spoke to his star pitcher about it Friday. 'It was a private conversation,' Hahn said. 'We certainly understand where Chris was coming from in terms of the emotion involved in the moment and what he was hoping to accomplish, and at the same time realizing that perhaps there was a better way to handle these things going forward.' Five players ultimately were ejected from Thursday night's game, which the Royals won in 13 innings. Among them was Cain, who has been hit by pitches four times this season. Moustakas and teammate Alex Gordon have been hit an AL-leading five times apiece, and the Royals have been hit 17 times as a team - tied with Texas for the league lead entering the day. Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight after the seventh inning of Thursday's game at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field, Illinois . 'This game's emotional and it seems to follow them around,' said White Sox manager Robin Ventura, who famously charged the mound and was pummeled by the Rangers' Nolan Ryan during a game in 1993. 'Everybody gets emotional and reacts to things and that's what happened.' The Royals are starting to earn a fighting reputation. Along with their two series with the White Sox and a tense three-game set in Oakland, Ventura got into a heated argument with Angels slugger Mike Trout during a series in Los Angeles. While acknowledging that the Royals must do a better job of containing their emotions, Yost insisted that his club has rarely been the instigator in a string of testy situations. 'Hopefully it's all behind us,' he said Thursday night, 'and we can move forward.' The teams played eight innings Friday night without incident, but the rest of the game was postponed due to rain with the score 2-2. It was supposed to resume Saturday, but more rain in Chicago means that it will now resume Sunday with the Royals batting in the top of the ninth. John Danks is scheduled to start for the White Sox in the second game Sunday, while fellow left-hander Jason Vargas is expected to go for the Royals. No makeup date was announced for Saturday's game.","Thursday's match between two baseball heavyweights turned into a brawl .

"The owners of two dogs that got loose and mauled a jogger to death in Michigan pleaded no contest on Friday to a reduced charge. Sebastiano Quagliata and his wife, Valbona Lucaj, pleaded no contest to owning a dangerous dog causing death in the fatal mauling last summer of Craig Sytsma of Livonia, The Flint Journal reported. 'I'm so sorry,' Lucaj told Sytsma's family. Sytsma, 46, was attacked by two cane corsos last July in Metamora Township, 45 miles northwest of Detroit. Sebastiano Quagliata (pictured) and his wife, Valbona Lucaj, pleaded no contest to owning a dangerous dog causing death in the fatal mauling of Craig Sytsma of Livonia, Michigan, and agreed to 15 years in jail . Lucaj (left), a native of Albania, and Quagliata, of Italy, could be deported after serving their sentences . Sytsma, 46, was attacked by two cane corsos last July in Metamora Township, 45 miles northwest of Detroit . The father-of-three was bitten some eight times by two hundred-pound cane corsos while jogging in Metamora Township in July, and was 'screaming and begging' for help in his final minutes. Lapeer County Prosecutor Tim Turkelson predicts a sentence of at least 19 months in prison when the two return to court on June 8. The two have been in custody for months and were facing a second-degree murder charge before making the plea deal. Lucaj, a native of Albania, and Quagliata, a native of Italy, could be deported after serving their sentences. They had 'no intention to do anything to hurt anyone,' defense attorney Jason Malkiewicz said. 'I think today was the first day my clients got to sit over there and accept responsibly for actions,' he said. 'I think the death of Mr Sytsma has sat in their heads for a year and it's been a nightmare to my clients, as well as everyone involved.' Attorney Glenn Saltsman said the Sytsma family is satisfied with the plea deal, although he believes laws covering dangerous dogs are 'archaic and weak'. There was evidence that the dogs had attacked other people on the road. 'These dogs should've never been alive after the first attack,' Saltsman said. The father-of-three was bitten some eight times by two hundred-pound cane corsos while jogging in July . Attorney Glenn Saltsman said the Sytsma family is satisfied with the plea deal. The sentencing will be in June . During the attack, one neighbor, a medic, used a belt as a tourniquet to stop Sytsma's bleeding. Helen Barwig had to pause the rescue efforts momentarily while the massive dogs came back. 'I'm bleeding out,' a desperate Sytsma told his rescuer, according to the Detroit Free Press. 'I'm dying.' He 'was losing a lot of blood and begged her to not let him die,' police wrote about incident. It took another neighbor, Barwig's boyfriend Edward Elmer, firing his .44-caliber Magnum at the dogs to end the attack. He struck one of the animals in the leg. Sytsma only had time to tell Barwig that his name was Craig before losing consciousness. He was rushed to a local hospital but soon died of his injuries. His dramatic final moments were revealed in response to a request by the Free Press under Michigan's Freedom of Information Act. The attack was the third since 2012 involving canines from Lucaj and Quagliata's property, officials said . The police records show the two dogs had run loose for months in the small rural community, attacking at least two neighbors months before they killed Sytsma. Some neighbors began to arm themselves, including the man whose shots eventually scared the cane corsos as Sytsma laid dying. The attack was the third since 2012 involving canines from Lucaj and Quagliata's property, officials said. 'Animal control should have done something,' said April Smith, who was bitten in May 2012 while walking her two dogs. Cane corsos are Italian dogs that are 'not to be trifled with', according to the American Kennel Club. The AKC report about the breed said: 'Topping out at nearly 28 inches at the shoulder and often weighing more than 100 pounds, with a large head, alert expression, and muscular frame, Cane Corsi are at a glance intimidating creatures.' 'Bred as guard dogs for centuries, their imposing appearance is their first line of defense against intruders.'","Father-of-three Craig Sytsma was mauled to death in Michigan last year .

"Cosmopolitan editor Bronwyn McCahon says she regrets that her magazine didn't more thoroughly investigate Belle Gibson before presenting her with its Fun Fearless Female Award in Sydney last year. But she says the award - which is given to inspiring women in times of 'triumph and adversity' - won't be taken off Ms Gibson, despite the Whole Pantry founder's admission of lying about her cancers. 'She was reader nominated and reader-voted,' McCahon said on the Dan and Maz 2DayFM breakfast show this week following Belle Gibson's Australian Women's Weekly interview in which she admitted she had lied, according to the Daily Telegraph. 'Obviously, if we knew then what we know now, we would never have awarded her,' she said. Scroll down for video . 'We would never have awarded her': Cosmo editor Bronwyn McMahon says she wishes her magazine had better investigated Belle Gibson, who created The Whole Pantry wellness movement, before awarding her the 2014 Fun Fearless Female Award . 'If we had our time over again, we would probably look into it further but what do you start doing? It's a competition where readers are nominating people that they're inspired by,' McCahon said on air. 'Thankfully she didn't win the role model category, she won the social media.' Gibson, 23, created a social media empire and  The Whole Pantry movement on the story of her remarkable cancer survival. Her wellness app and clean-eating cookbook promised to help her 300,000 plus followers live 'the whole life.' But doubt was cast over story when media investigations in March revealed the wellness guru had failed to hand over money raised through social media to five charities as promised. Close friends also raised concerns about her survival claims and Gibson admitted her cancers may have been 'misdiagnosed.'

Cosmo Australia editor Bronwyn McCahon has said she regrets that her magazine didn't more thoroughly investigate Belle Gibson before presenting her with its Fun Fearless Female Award in last year . Gibson told AWW her cancer lies stemmed from a troubled childhood, saying she was estranged from her mother and didn't have toys as a child . The Whole Pantry app founder had said she was not scared of death but  'heartbroken' at the idea of leaving her son Olivier . McMahon said Gibson made a convincing and moving acceptance speech at the awards ceremony in November last year. 'She got up and gave that amazing speech. You guys were there. She had all of us in tears. She was very believable and I think we all wanted to believe her,' she said. 'I mean who’s going to question when someone is talking about that they’ve got cancer and they’re going through this horrendous life experience?' 'I created the the world's best health, fitness and lifestyle app - and through that we are changing lives,' Gibson  said in her acceptance speech at the Cosmo awards last year . In her speech, Ms Gibson said she was 'incredibly honoured' that people wanted to share her life. 'I dedicate this award to everyone of you who do follow me on Instagram or through the Whole Pantry because through that, I created the the world's best health, fitness and lifestyle app -  and through that we are changing lives,' she said. This week, in an interview with the Australian Women's Weekly, Gibson admitted she never had cancer. 'No. None of it’s true,' she said. 'I am still jumping between what I think I know and what is reality. I have lived it and I’m not really there yet.'

McCahon said the 'whole foundation' of Cosmopolitan magazine is about 'empowering women and supporting the sisterhood' at the same time as she was explaining why GIbson will be allowed to keep her award. 'I also am very cautious of where everybody goes from here. Obviously what Belle did is terrible and it’s irresponsible and it’s all of those things but she’s also now getting this lashing of bullying and the last 48 hours would have been horrendous for her. She needs now to get help and move through this,' she said on air.

"Two sisters from Oklahoma and Nebraska missing for nearly two weeks in Michigan survived on Girl Scout cookies while stuck in their snow-trapped SUV until state police discovered them Friday near Lake Superior in a remote part of the Upper Peninsula. A pilot noticed a reflection off the Ford Explorer and landed the police helicopter on shore, finally ending the women's unexpected wilderness adventure. Leslie Roy, 52, and Lee Marie Wright, 56, were examined at a hospital and released. ‘It was sheer joy,’ Detective Sgt. Jeff Marker told The Associated Press, describing their reaction to the rescue. ‘It was almost disbelief that it was finally happening.’ Alive! Lee Wright (left), and Leslie Roy (right) are pictured eating and keeping warm in state police coats after they had spent two weeks stuck in their disabled SUV in Michigan . Roy, of Valley, Nebraska, and Wright of Depew, Oklahoma, got stuck about three miles from Crisp Point Lighthouse in Luce County in the Upper Peninsula. They had been visiting relatives in Ishpeming, in another part of the peninsula, and were planning to head south April 11. They had a reservation at a hotel in Mackinaw City but never showed up. Instead, they were entombed in snow on a remote used road with eight boxes of Girl Scout cookies purchased from relatives and a bag of cheese puffs, Marker said. ‘They thought the road was plowed but it wasn't,’ he said. There is no cellphone service in the area. The car eventually lost power, too. Roy and Wright wore layers of clothes to stay warm as overnight temperatures fell to the 20s, and they also turned snow into water. ‘They heard crunching in the woods at night,’ Marker said. ‘They thought it was rescuers but no one came. Then they thought it was bears.’ When the search began, police said the women had told others about possibly visiting waterfalls and casinos on their way to the Lower Peninsula. Their Ford Explorer was spotted from a helicopter around 2.30pm, police said. About 25 minutes later, police officers who were called to the scene reached the car on foot. 'When we pulled up, they grabbed their purses and Lee Wright clutched onto her Bible and both women were very happy,' Marker told MLive.com. 'It was hugs all around.'

"A mom's decision to take her 11-year-old daughter to a Pink concert has a judge saying, 'So what?' The New Jersey judge says the concert trip isn't evidence of bad parenting, despite protestations by the father. NJ.com reports the girl's parents are divorced, and her father accused his ex-wife of 'abusing her parental discretion' by taking their daughter to the December 2013 concert at the Prudential Center in Newark, as part of the singer's national Truth About Love tour. The mother admitted to being a 'little on guard' about taking her daughter, but that the girl was 'dying to go', so the mom looked up clips of the show on YouTube and deemed them age-appropriate. The parents have joint custody, and the father said he disagreed with the 'sexually suggestive' nature of some of Pink's performances and did not want his daughter seeing it. Scroll down for video . Sexually suggestive?: A New Jersey father has claimed as part of a custody battle that his ex-wife 'abused her parental discretion' by taking their daughter to Pink's December 2013 concert at the Prudential Center in Newark (pictured). A judge ruled that while the singer's works can be suggestive, they are preteen-appropriate . But state Superior Court Judge Lawrence Jones rejected the complaint in a 37-page decision that contained a brief history of rock `n' roll and a commentary on the increasing use of judges as referees for warring divorced parents. Jones said Pink may have some suggestive moves and lyrics, but she's an artist whose works aren't necessarily inappropriate for preteens. Jones noted in his decision that he spoke privately with the girl, who is now 12, and took into consideration the mother's reasoning for allowing her daughter to attend the show. He found that the mother 'in no way, shape or form exceeded the boundaries of reasonable parental judgment' in taking the girl to the show during her own parenting time. He also found that she didn't subject the child to any unreasonable risk of harm, or compromise the girl's health, safety or welfare. Acrobatics:  P!nk peforms at the Prudential Center on December 11, 2013 in Newark, New Jersey . 'To the contrary, when all the smoke from the custody litigation clears, it will be self-evident that all which happened here is that a young girl went to her first rock concert with her mother and had a really great time,' the judge wrote in his decision. The judge also quoted the lyrics from Pink's songs 'The Great Escape' and 'Perfect' as examples of messages for adolescents. Interestingly, Perfect, was originally called F-----g Perfect, before being cleaned of its expletives and released to radio.","The New Jersey parents are divorced and share custody of their three kids .

"At least 18 people have died in an avalanche on Mount Everest sparked by a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Nepal. The avalanche buried part of base camp, raising fears for the safety of hundreds of climbers who are in the area, said Gyanendra Shrestha from the Tourism Ministry in Kathmandu. A number of Britons are among those who have not been heard from since the quake.The identities of those who died in the avalanche have not yet been released. Scroll down for video . Avalanche: Terrifying avalanche pictured from basecamp on Mount Everest caused by the earthquake today . The avalanche was caused by a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake which struck Nepal and has claimed the lives of almost 1,000 people . Carsten Lillelund Pedersen hid behind these rocks when the avalanche caught up with him at basecamp . A dining tent at basecamp has been turned into hospital. People are being treated for head injuries and fractures . Among those listed on Google Person Finder is Sebastian Lovera, a 22-year-old qualified skiing and diving instructor, from Tonbridge, Kent. His last known location was Khumjung on Tuesday, from where he was heading towards Everest Base Camp. His step-father, Greg Smye-Rumsby, said: 'Sebastian is an extremely lively and self-motivating person and that is why he went to Napal. 'We haven't heard from him. He would not have switched his phone off. We have tried ringing it. Sometimes it rings and sometimes we get an answer but it's an automated answer. It says the phone is switched off. He's certainly not a person to take risks. He's the absolute opposite.' Another Briton feared missing is Laura Wood, 23, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. She is described by a friend as a 'glowing lovely beautiful young girl often dressed in hippy type clothing'. Miss Wood, who has a strong northern accent, has been trekking in the Himalayas without any means of making contact. Officials today confirmed that at least 1,341 people have died as rescue teams continue to search for survivors who are feared to be trapped under rubble. The death toll is expected to rise. Carsten Lillelund Pedersen pictured after the avalanche . Tweeting from the mountain, Daniel Mazur from Bristol wrote: 'A massive earthquake just hit Everest. Basecamp has been severely damaged. Our team is caught in camp 1. Please pray for everyone.' Briton Chris Harling, from Cumbria, who is leader of the Adventure Peaks Everest North Ridge 2015 Expedition was also on the mountain when the avalanche struck. Posting on Facebook, he wrote: 'Here in base camp we initially felt minor tremmors, then the ground began to feel like jelly as waves passed through the rocks beneath our feet. 'Climbers appeared from tents all over camp to try to start to comprehend what they were feeling. 'As the movement became more violent I expected the loose and precarious rocky slopes above the camp area . to start shedding huge boulders - it was extremely alarming wondering if we were to be buried by rockfall. 'Sure enough, an area of steep cliffs did break off sending car sized boulders hurtling down only a few hundred metres from our tents. We are still feeling aftershocks hours later. He added: 'Our thoughts are with any local staff working on Everest who may have been affected by losses in today's quake.' Climber Alex Gavan from Romania tweeted: 'Everest basecamp huge earthquake then huge avalanche from Pumori. Running for life from my tent. Unhurt. Many, many people up the mountain. 'Huge disaster. Helped searched and rescued victims through huge debris area. Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap.' A senior mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, said the avalanche occurred between the Khumbu Icefall, a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow, and the basecamp where most climbing expeditions have their main camps. A mountaineer reports from basecamp on Mount Everest following the avalanche which was caused by a quake . Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, a Dane who is climbing Everest with Belgian climber Jelle Veyt, said on his Facebook page that they were at Khumbu Icefall when the earthquake hit. He wrote: 'The earthquake near Everest was very strong and we could feel the earth shaking a lot, and then a huge avalanche swept over basecamp and Jelle and I had to run for our life, but I did not reach the tents and I had to hide behind the the stone puja. 'I could not see anything and it was hard to breath. 'Our camp is at the end of basecamp which is like a small city with almost 500 tents, I am sure there are casualties, and we fear for an Indian group we met that were heading up the ice fall.' He said  the injured, including one person with many broken bones, had begun to arrive. 'He was blown away by the avalanche and broke both legs,' Mr Lillelund Pedersen said. 'For the camps closer to where the avalanche hit, our Sherpas believe that a lot of people may have been buried in their tents. 'There is now a steady flow of people fleeing basecamp in hope of more security further down the mountain.' Everest basecamp: At least 18 people have died and many have been injured in the avalanche . Norwegian climber Teodor Glomnes Johansen, who was at basecamp, told a newspaper in Norway they are working to save lives. 'We carry out severely injured people. This is pretty tough and heavy. We do not know whether there will be more avalanches,' Mr Glomnes Johansen told Norway's VG newspaper. 'All those who are unharmed organise help with the rescue efforts. Men, women and Sherpas are working side-by-side. The job right now is to assist the doctors in the camp here.' Chinese media has reported that a Chinese climber and two Sherpa guides were among the dead. Climber Robin Trygg told Swedish news agency TT his Sherpa guides had been in radio contact with other guides on Everest and they reported an avalanche there hitting as many as 80 people. 'We were sitting in the tent and drinking tea when the earth, all of a sudden, began shaking. We didn't understand what happened,' he told the news agency. The United States Geological Survey said the quake struck 81 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 06.11 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside of their homes . A senior mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, said an avalanche swept the face of Everest after the earthquake . The avalanche is believed to have occurred between the Khumbu Icefall, a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow, and basecamp . Ministry officials estimated that at least 1,000 climbers, including about 400 foreigners, had been at basecamp or on Everest when the earthquake struck. April is one of the most popular times to scale Everest, before rain and clouds cloak the peak at the end of May. Mohan Krishna Sapkota, joint secretary in the Nepalese tourism ministry, said the government was struggling to assess the damage on Everest because of poor phone coverage. 'The trekkers are scattered all around the basecamp and some had even trekked further up,' Sapkota said. 'It is almost impossible to get in touch with anyone.' Choti Sherpa, who works at the Everest Summiteers Association, said she had been unable to call her family and colleagues on the mountain. 'Everyone is trying to contact each other, but we can't,' she said. 'We are all very worried.' Google has launched a 'person finder' website to help people reconnect with friends and loved ones in the aftermath of the earthquake.

Rescue teams continue to search for survivors who are feared to be trapped under the rubble. Home Ministry official Laxmi Dhakal warned the death toll is almost certain to rise. Effects of the quake were felt hundreds of miles away in neighbouring countries with 36 killed in India, 12 in Tibet and 4 in Bangladesh. Two Chinese citizens died at the Nepal-China border. In a statement from the Foreign and Commonweath Office, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'My thoughts are with the people of Nepal and everyone affected by the terrible loss of life and widespread damage caused by the earthquake. 'We are in close contact with the Nepalese government.

"Bruce Jenner revealed he is a Republican and a Christian during the much-anticipated interview in which he revealed he is transitioning to be a woman. Interviewer Diane Sawyer looked shocked when he made the revelation on her ABC 20/20 special last night. Jenner said 'I've always been on the more conservative side' when he was asked about LGBT issues - and replied 'yes' when asked if he was a Republican. Sawyer had mentioned President's decision to identify trans citizens in his most recent State of The Union address. Jenner said: “He actually was the first one to say the actual word transgender, I will certainly give him credit for that.' 'But not to get political, I’ve just never been a big fan — I’m kind of more on the conservative side.' Scroll down for video . Republican: Bruce Jenner told Diane Sawyer he is a Republican as he announced his transition to a woman on Friday night . Jenner added that neither the Republicans nor Democrats had a 'monopoly on understanding' and said he would lobby the GOP over LGBT rights. 'I would do that, yeah, in a heartbeat,' he said. He also said in the interview that he still considers himself a heterosexual, discussed his faith and said he was a Christian. 'I would sit in church and always wonder, ""In God’s eyes, how does he see me?""' he said. 'Maybe this is my cause in life.' His remarks came in the Friday night interview in which Jenner  revealed that he identifies as a woman - his 'true self' and a childhood dream - in an explosive ABC interview with Diane Sawyer. The 65-year-old Olympic gold medalist and reality TV star sparked rumors about his gender identity last year after visibly altering his appearance. And last night, he confirmed that he is reinventing himself physically in a bid to transition from male to female in the highly-anticipated, intimate sit-down. Speaking in front of millions of viewers, including Kim Kardashian and her family, Bruce tearfully revealed: 'For all intents and purposes, I am a woman. Christian: Jenner also said that he is a Christian and wondered whether transitioning to a woman was his cause in life . 'My brain is much more female than it is male. That's what my soul is. Bruce lives a lie. She is not a lie.' He firmly added: 'I can't do it anymore.' During the interview, Bruce also admitted that he has been regularly taking female hormones - and plans to completely transform into a woman. But he said he was still attracted to females. 'I was never attracted to the guys,' he told Diane, explaining how he has always enjoyed a good sex life. And he denied that his revelations were for publicity purposes. Instead, he made them due to his inability to continue to 'pull the curtain', he said. Indeed, hiding his identity was so painful for Bruce that it once left him contemplating suicide to escape from the never-ending scrutiny, he revealed. Many viewers and celebrities were taking to social media last night to congratulate Bruce on making a giant leap for the transgender community. Lady Gaga tweeted: '#BruceJennerABC Now that is bravery', before telling her fans to 'empower people like Bruce' globally by 'being loving & not mean'. Meanwhile, Bruce's 17-year-old daughter, Kylie Jenner, tweeted an emotional message to her father. 'Understandingly, this has been very hard for me. You will hear what I have to say when I'm ready to but this isn't about me. I'm so proud of you, Dad. You are so brave.

"Disgraced former mayor Lutfur Rahman (pictured) is said to have played the race card to silence opponents - and his deputy today reiterated claims there is deep seated racism in the borough of Tower Hamlets, in east London . A deputy of disgraced former mayor Lutfur Rahman yesterday appeared to blame the vote-rigging scandal on ‘institutional racism’. Oliur Rahman, who took over from the deposed leader yesterday, insisted there was deep-rooted racism within the East London borough of Tower Hamlets. His comment was at odds with a devastating legal ruling that condemned his predecessor for bribery and ballot fraud and found he had repeatedly ‘played the race card’ to silence critics. The two men – who are not related – are both members of the Tower Hamlets First party. Political opponents said they were playing the same ‘cracked record’ by seeking to blame racism and Islamophobia for their problems. Oliur Rahman told the BBC: ‘If people say there is no racism in Tower Hamlets, then they are very much mistaken because there is institutional racism. ‘If people want to turn a blind eye to the racism then that’s their decision but they are very much mistaken if they turn round and say there is no racism in Tower Hamlets, and that people are not judged because of their skin colour and their religion.’ On Thursday, electoral judge Richard Mawrey QC found that Lutfur Rahman, 49, and his cronies had rigged the 2014 mayoral ballot by creating an army of ‘ghost voters’, forging postal votes, bribing Muslim voters and using religious intimidation against them and branding opponents as racists. He found that all the councillors from the Tower Hamlets First party were elected corruptly. Oliur Rahman, 34, a former councillor for George Galloway’s Respect party but now a Tower Hamlets First councillor, emailed his fellow members yesterday to declare himself acting mayor until new elections. He said: ‘Following the verdict, I have assumed the executive role within the council, until a mayoral election is held.’ Peter Golds, the leader of the Tory group in Tower Hamlets, said: ‘Oliur Rahman ought to be hanging his head in shame and apologising to the borough, but I don’t think he gets it. ‘It’s ludicrous to play the race card again. They roll out this hoary old chestnut every time anything happens. The real unpleasant racism has come from the ranks of Tower Hamlets First. ‘They’ve got one cracked record, that any criticism of them is Islamophobic and racist. Now they’re playing it again, despite the court case. Nothing has changed.’ Lutfur Rahman, who was Britain’s first elected Muslim mayor, has met lawyers to discuss seeking a judicial review of the Election Court’s decision that he was responsible for bribery and voter fraud. Supporters said he continued to deny any wrongdoing. Police have been urged to launch a fresh investigation into fraud in the 2014 mayoral election, which will be re-run in June. Lutfur Rahman, a Bangladesh-born former Labour council leader, has been banned from running for public office, or even voting, for five years. Four voters launched legal action against him after complaints that police and the Electoral Commission had failed to act. Andy Erlam - who launched legal action against the mayor with Angela Moffat and Azmal Hussein (pictured left to right) - said Oliur Rahman was in 'complete denial' The group was headed by Andy Erlam, who stood as a councillor on an anti-corruption ticket. Mr Erlam said Lutfur Rahman’s supporters – including Oliur Rahman – were in ‘complete denial’. He added: ‘They are still claiming Rahman didn’t do anything wrong despite a devastating judgment by a respected High Court judge who spent six weeks considering the dreadful evidence. ‘It makes me shudder to think they were in charge of a £1.3billion budget of taxpayers’ money.’","Oliur Rahman took over from deposed mayor Lutfur Rahman yesterday .

"New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton swooned over the 'boy band' of four Swedish cops who broke up a subway fight in The Big Apple this week, complimenting their use of safe and effective restraint tactics. Tourist police officers Samuel Kvarzell, Markus Asberg, Eric Jansberger and Erik Naslund halted a fight between two homeless men on the Uptown 6 train this Wednesday. A video of the selfless act then surfaced and has spread on social media, gaining them attention from hoards of fans, both male and female. Officials from the United States and Sweden have praised their brave efforts and they are set to return home as heroes. Scroll down for video . Giving thanks: New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton (center) thanked four Swedish cops who broke up a subway fight in The Big Apple this week . 'I would like to acknowledge them. There’s been a lot of attention paid to them, appropriately so, over the last day or so: a New York Post story and some other coverage,' Bratton said on Friday. 'Gentlemen, thank you very, very much. You did a great honor to yourselves, certainly to your police service and to your country. We appreciate all the help we can get,' he said. 'Here as tourists, they stepped up,' he added. The New York Post reports that the techniques employed by the Swedish men are in line with what the NYPD teaches their police officers. The physical force they employed is not intended to hurt the individual they are restraining and is still very effective. 'I was noticing that the moves that they made are very much the same moves that we now teach our young people at the academy in terms of how to take people down in a way trying to ensure that they’re not injured during that apprehension,' Bratton said with pride. Bratton presented the men with medallions. When the four men return to Sweden they will be awarded at a lunch with Sweden's minister for home affairs Anders Ygema. 'The minister has invited the police officers to the government office for lunch once they get back to Sweden,' spokesman Fredrik Persson said. Earlier this week officer Asberg said what he and his friends did was 'no big deal.' Bratton disagrees with him and commends their actions. '[They] found themselves involved a situation on the subway where they activated themselves as police officers,' Bratton said. '‎We very much appreciate that,' he said. 'We're no heroes, just tourists': The Swedish cops (pictured left to right) Erik Näslund, 26, Samuel Kvarzell, 25, Makrus Åsberg, 25, and Eric Jansberger, 28, said they were just answering the call of duty . The Swedish friends were on their way to see Les Misérables on Broadway on Wednesday, DNA Info reports, and rushed in to stop a brutal assault on a crowded rush-hour 6 train. 'We came here for vacation. We’ve been here one day. We’re no heroes, just tourists,' Makrus Åsberg, a 25-year-old officer with the police Uppsala, Sweden, told the New York Post. Mr Asberg, along with Erik Naslund, Samuel Kvarzell and Eric Jansberger, subdued an enraged homeless man who was viciously beating another rider on the train. The Samaritan Scandinavians stopped the violence and held the attacker until the NYPD could arrive, the Post reports. Video from the incident shows Kvarzell and Asberg holding the suspect down and trying to calm him down as he screams. 'I can't breath! I can't breath!' he screams. 'Take it easy, just calm down,' Asberg tells him. The friends sprang into action after a frantic conductor yelled over the intercom: 'Are there any police officers on the train?' As the train pulled into the Bleeker Street station, the Nordic lawmen found a homeless man pummeling another rider in the next car. Three of the Swedes tended to the aggressor (background) and held him for police, while the fourth stayed with the victim, who had been badly beaten in the fight . The Nordic tourists kept both men calm until NYPD cops showed up to sort out the scene . The victim had a bloody mouth and seemed to be badly beaten and was not defending himself the Swedes told the Post. One of the officers put the attacker in an arm lock, while two others held him down to the floor of the train. 'One of the guys tried to wrestle us so [we] wrestled him to the floor until the police came,' Kvarzell, 25, who is also an officer, told DNA Info. 'We don't have authority or anything but we thought somebody might need help,' he said. When NYPD officers showed up, they took custody of the aggressor and the four tourists went on their way to Les Misérables. Markus Asberg (left) and Samuel Kvarzell (right) stepped in to stop a brutal beating on a New York subway train along with two other friends, all of whom are police officers in their native Sweden .

"While the debate about whether workers prefer a cubicle over an open office layout, a office furniture company has come up with a design that is possibly a happy medium. Steelcase's the Brody WorkLounge is an effort to preserve the privacy and less distractions given in a cubicle while still being a part of an open office work community. On its company website, Steelcase said the Brody is designed to be 'good for your body and good for your brain'. Scroll down for video . Office furniture company Steelcase designed the work space seating to provide privacy in an open office setting (above designs of the Brody WorkLounge) The seating will be available for purchase in late August starting at $2,700 . Brody features an LED task light, privacy screen, foot rest, storage space and personal adjustable work surface . The Brody, which will be available late August starting at $2,700, sort of resembles both a desk and an office and is created to limit distractions by creating a shelter while also providing privacy, according to the company. The Cognitive Neuroscience Karolinska Institute in Sweden's work on flow - a passing state of deep concentration where workers are their most productive - informed the design of Brody, according to CityLab. 'We had kind of an intuitive understanding of how people liked to study,' Mark McKenna, director of product design at Steelcase told Fast Company. 'As the project developed, and as we started diving into what it means to focus and why someone would want to escape, these new findings really helped guide the project.' 'The Brody WorkLounge creates a shelter from visual distractions, provides privacy and provides an enhanced sense of psychological security,' the company said on its website . The design for Brody is based on The Cognitive Neuroscience Karolinska Institute in Sweden's work on flow - a passing state of deep concentration where workers are their most productive . In the U.S., 70 per cent of offices have low or no partitions as they embrace open office plans . Each WorkLounge features a mini LED task light, a power outlet, personal work surface that adjusts up to a 40 degree pitch, a privacy screen, a side surface which also serves as an armrest, patented LiveLumbar technology which gives back support, personal storage off of the floor, a foot rest, and a cushion that adapts to each person's size. 'The ability to focus is a real challenge for today's workers and students,' the company said on its website. 'We get interrupted or distracted every 11 minutes and it takes over 23 minutes to get back on task. 'The Brody WorkLounge creates a shelter from visual distractions, provides privacy and provides an enhanced sense of psychological security.' By transforming the under-utilized in-between spaces into these modern alternative to enclaves, where workers can get away for a couple of hours, Steelcase claims its design will help organizations and universities by delivering a 'high-performance work space'. A study revealed that a sense of privacy boosts performance, and Brody WorkLounge strives to provide workers with limited visual distractions . Mark McKenna, director of product design at Steelcase said: 'I think it's clear that people in an office need a place to focus. But the bench is here to stay. It's conducive to collaboration' In recent years, many companies have embraced open offices with about 70 per cent of U.S. offices having no or low partitions, according to the International Facility Management Association. However, a 2013 study revealed that workers are frustrated by the distractions in open offices which lead to poorer work performance, according to the Washington Post. That study also found that nearly half of the surveyed workers in open offices said the lack of sound privacy proved to be a problem for them while more than 30 per cent complained about the lack of visual privacy. Another study revealed that having a sense of privacy actually boosts performance. While Brody is not a stance against open offices, it provides a place for people to focus while in an office, McKenna told Fast Company. 'I think it's clear that people in an office need a place to focus,' McKenna said. 'But the bench is here to stay. It's conducive to collaboration.'","Furniture company, Steelcase, has created the Brody WorkLounge .

"It's the $65 million crime thriller that claims to tell the true story of the most infamous and violent criminal in the history of South Boston, James 'Whitey' Bulger. But 'Black Mass', the upcoming film starring Johnny Depp and Dakota Johnson, has already upset the families of some of Bulger's many victims ahead of its release in September. Steven Davis, 57, of Milton, and his relatives are sure Bulger killed his sister, Debra Davis, in 1981, despite the jury returning a 'no finding' verdict. Following the release of the first Black Mass trailer this week, Mr Davis told The Boston Globe he and his family are upset and offended that people will be profiting from their tragedy. Scroll down for video . Hurt: Steven Davis holds up a photo of his dead sister, Debra Davis, who he believes was murdered by Whitey Bulger in 1981. His family are upset that Bulger's exploits have been made into a move, Black Mass . First look: Davis spoke out following the release this week of the first trailer for Black Mass, which showed Johnny Depp for the first time as Whitey Bulger . Unrecognizable: In the trailer, Depp is completely transformed for the role.  He looks several years older, with grey slicked back hair and his brown eyes changes to a grey-blue. Bulger pictured in a 1973 mugshot, right . Murdered: Debra Davis was the girlfriend of Bulger's second-in-command, and Bulger allegedly killed her because he believed she knew too much about their crime ring, which involved corrupt cops . 'A lot of the families are very, very upset about this,' Davis told The Globe. 'I don't like it one bit. . . . Everybody seems to be profiting off it. 'It's sad for the movie industry, it's sad for the actors.' With Bulger's reign of terror throughout the city from the 1970's, Davis said it was too early to relive such atrocities. 'It's too much hurt still going on,' he told the newspaper. 'It's still too new to the heart for people.' Another major point Davis makes is that the film glamorizes Bulger, who was an FBI informant from 1975 to 1990. 'He was a piece of (expletive) anyway,' Davis said. 'The only reason he had the power to do what he did was because the FBI was protecting him. 'The movie industry and the actors, they're the ones making the money. 'It's another (expletive) slap in the face, that's what we're getting paid. Another slap in the face.' Dead: Debra Davis was 26-years-old when she was killed in South Boston in 1981 . Hollywood portrayal: Black Mass, starring Johnny Depp, is based on the 2001 book, Black Mass: The True Story Of An Unholy Alliance Between The FBI And The Irish Mob, written by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill . Debra Davis was 26-years-old when she died. She was the girlfriend of Stephen 'The Rifleman' Flemmi, Bulger's second lieutenant. Flemmi testified at Bulger's murder trial in 2013 that he delivered Davis to Bulger to be killed. Flemmi had 'blurted out' to his girlfriend about the arrangement he and Bulger had with John Connolly, the corrupt ex-FBI agent who enabled the Winter Hill Gang's criminal activities for years. When news of this got back to Bulger, he decided she had to die, Flemmi testified. Flemmi said he was meant to kill Davis himself, but after luring her to a house in South Boston, he realized he couldn't do it. That's when, he claims, Bulger strangled her to death. After the killing, Flemmi testified, Bulger 'went upstairs and laid down' while he cleaned up the crime scene, WGBH News reported. At his home outside Boston, Steven Davis holds a Magnum 357 bullet he says was given to him by Boston area gangster James ' Whitey' Bulger in 1982--a gesture Davis perceived as a veiled threat from Bulger . They removed her clothes, wrapped her in a tarp and buried her in a makeshift grave. Flemmi said Bulger stood by and watched as he and some other associated dug the grave. However Bulger strongly denied killing Davis and was not found guilty. Black Mass is based on the 2001 book, Black Mass: The True Story Of An Unholy Alliance Between The FBI And The Irish Mob, written by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. The film also stars Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Peter Sarsgaard and Dakota Johnson. Bulger topped the FBI's most wanted list for 16 years before he was finally arrested in 2011. He had a long career of run-ins with the law, dating all the way back to when he was just 14 years old. In the early 70s, after spending nine years in prison for armed robbery and truck hijacking, Bulger returned to Boston and joined a prominent Irish mob in South Boston. Captured: Bulger pictured on the left in 2011, after he was finally arrested after 16 years on the run. He is currently imprisoned in a maximum security prison in Florida. Depp on the right . As he became climbed up the rankings of the mob, Bulger was recruited in the mid 1970s to become an informant for the FBI, supplying the bureau with information on a rival crime family. Then in 1997, Bulger was outed as an informant in newspaper reports and he went on the run when his own handler said he was about to be hit with an indictment. For the next 16 years, Bulger evaded law enforcement until he was finally caught on June 22, 2011 at a Santa Monica, California apartment he shared with his longtime girlfriend. He went on trial two years later on 32 counts of racketeering, money laundering, extortion, weapons charges, and ties to 19 murders. He was found guilty on 31 of those charges in August and sentenced to two consecutive life in prison sentences in November 2013. The 84-year-old is currently incarcerated at an all-male federal high-security prison in Sumterville, Florida. Jack Nicholson's character in the Oscar-winning film The Departed is thought to be loosely based on Bulger.","'Black Mass' is a $65 million crime thriller set to be released in September .

"Crowds who turned out for the Anzac Day memorial service at Sydney’s Martin Place have been left fuming after the Ivy nightclub played loud dance music during the minute’s silence. A contractor doing a sound check inside the exclusive club is believed to have been responsible for turning the music on. Many of those in the record crowd of 30,000 took to Twitter to express their anger at the club interrupting the minute’s silence on at least five occasions. The club, on George Street in Sydney’s CBD, is close to the Martin Place War Memorial. Father Arron Cutugno said he was 'disgusted' by the choice to play music during the minutes silence . Arron Cutugno, who was taking his young daughter to her first Anzac Day ceremony, described the decision to play music while the minute’s silence was being observed as ‘disgusting’. ‘Really enjoyed the service, everything was great until Ivy decided to start playing music three quarters of the way through the minute of silence,’ he told Channel Nine. ‘I can tell you there were at least a thousand people who looked straight up and were disgusted by it."" Others have taken to social media to voice their furore, with a flurry of messages on Twitter taking the restaurant to task over the incident. A spokesperson for Merivale, which runs the Ivy, said the company was 'mortified and deeply upset' by the incident and offered unreserved apologies for the disturbance. 'As a measure of respect, we worked with police to close Ivy at 2am, one and a half hours earlier than normal, to reduce noise and crowding around the venue when people arrived at the dawn service,' the group said.

"Angela Merkel threw down the gauntlet to David Cameron last night and said large countries should be prepared to accept more asylum seekers. The German Chancellor demanded a new European Union system that distributes asylum-seekers to member states based on their population and economic strength. The call comes as Europe struggles with the growing refugee crisis in the Mediterranean, where hundreds have died in recent days trying to get from northern Africa to Italy. Scroll down for video . German Chancellor Angela Merkel has demanded a new European Union system that distributes asylum-seekers to member states based on their population and economic strength . David Cameron insisted at an emergency EU summit on Thursday that the UK would not take any of the refugees – because it was already doing its part by virtue of having the continent's largest aid and defence budgets. Mrs Merkel's call would however mean that Britain, one of the most populous countries in the UK and one of its most economically successful, would be expected to take in more people. Speaking at a campaign event ahead of state elections in Bremen, she said yesterday that the EU's own rules on asylum-seekers are not working. She called for the current rules, known as the Dublin regulations, to be scrapped. 'The Dublin rules need to be changed,' she told fellow EU leaders. 'Five member states account for three-quarters of all asylum-seekers' under the present system. Under the Dublin regulations, refugees have to claim asylum in the first EU country they enter, and cannot pick and choose between member states. But Germany has long accused southern EU countries of ignoring the rules and encouraging asylum-seekers to move on. The majority of refugees arrive on Europe's southern shores after crossing the Mediterranean. The border free Schengen Area means they can easily move onto to other EU countries, despite the rules. The German government is believed to be particularly concerned that the Italian authorities are not doing enough to register asylum-seekers who arrive there. The European leaders gathered this week for an emergency meeting in Brussels in the wake of the tragedy in the Mediterranean. Pictured from left is Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and British Prime Minister David Cameron . Germany believes it is being made to bear an disproportionate burden of asylum-seekers lured there by its strong economy. In 2014, Germany received 173,070 asylum applications, more than twice as many as any other EU country. In the same period, the UK received 31,260 applications, according to UN refugee agency. Her remarks came a day after Mr Cameron flatly ruled out Britain taking part in an voluntary EU scheme to 'resettle' north African migrants throughout the continent. He told his counterparts at the EU summit that the UK is already 'playing its part' in the region through the aid budget and offer of ships, and takes in its 'fair share' of refugees compared to other member states. Donald Tusk, the European Council president, said earlier on Thursday that EU leaders must 'sacrifice some national interests for the common good' by taking part in a 'resettlement' programme.","Angela Merkel has challenged Cameron to accept more asylum seekers .

"Shattering its windscreen, this is the incredible moment a bus ploughed into a passenger plane at Tashkent airport in Uzbekistan. The incident is difficult to comprehend as the collision was much more than just a minor skirmish on the tarmac at the busy Asian airport. The damage on the vehicle is clear, although it is unknown if the engine of the Boeing 777 jet was damaged or if anyone was injured. The bus ploughed into the engine of the Uzbekistan Airways Boeing 777 passenger jet . Tashkent is the largest international airport in Uzbekistan, and the busiest in Central Asia, so the crash will have more than likely delayed many passengers. The plane was believed to be an Uzbekistan Airways service, the national airline of the country, with its headquarters at Tashkent. MailOnline Travel has contacted Uzbekistan Airways and is awaiting comment. This kind of incident is unfortunately becoming more common. Ryanair passengers travelling to Edinburgh and Zadar, Croatia were delayed for hours after two of the budget airline’s planes clipped wings at Dublin Airport back on April 1. Photos snapped by travellers show the tip of a winglet dangling by a thread after clipping the other plane - and it's the second time in six months two Ryanair planes have collided at Ireland's busiest airport. It's difficult to comprehend the moments leading up the crash as the force of impact is severe . Passengers escaped injury when the planes collided as they taxied to a runway shortly before 8am, but the incident caused disruption for hundreds of travellers. In October 2014 a Ryanair jet had its winglet torn off when it collided with another plane belonging to the budget carrier at Dublin Airport. The Boeing 737s heading to Edinburgh and Brussels were taxiing to a runway when they collided in darkness. In January this year a British Airways plane hit a hangar at Heathrow Airport, while being towed away for routine maintenance. As the Boeing 777-200 aircraft was being towed towards a hangar, someone misjudged the distance and the plane's wing clipped the wall of a nearby building. There were no injuries from the collision, and the airport and airline continued to operate normally for the rest of the day.","Worrying incident happened at Tashkent Airport in Uzbekistan .

"Mobile phones and tablet computers are becoming dangerous distractions for parents who are supposed to be supervising their children, researchers claim. A study found youngsters were more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them were distracted – with texting or talking on the phone a common cause. Researchers observed randomly selected parents with children who looked between 18 months and five years old at playgrounds in New York. Children are more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them are distracted by texting or talking on the phone, the study showed (file picture) They measured factors such as the adult’s level of engagement with the child and how distracted they seemed. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head-first. Children whose carers were distracted were ‘significantly’ more likely to behave in this way. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head-first and found children whose carers were distracted were ‘significantly’ more likely to behave in this way . Electronic devices such as mobile phones were responsible for 30 per cent of all parental distractions. Three children fell while the researchers were observing them although none was seriously hurt. Study author Ruth Milanaik, of Cohen Children’s Medical Centre in New York, called on gadget-obsessed parents to keep a closer eye on their offspring, saying: ‘Increased awareness of limiting electronic distractions and other activities that interfere with supervision should be considered.’ A neuroscientist claims that modern technology such as computer tablets and mobile phones could be changing the way our brains work . Professor Susan Greenfield warned that unless people wake up to the damage that the gadget-filled, pharmaceutically-enhanced 21st century may be doing to our brains, we could be sleepwalking towards a future in which neuro-chip technology blurs the line between living and non-living machines, and between our bodies and the outside world. Electronic devices such as mobile phones and computer tablets could be anging the way our brains work, according to a neuroscientist . She said: 'One vital fact I have learnt is that the brain is not the unchanging organ that we might imagine. 'It not only goes on developing, changing and, in some tragic cases, eventually deteriorating with age, it is also substantially shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life. When I say ""shaped"", I'm not talking figuratively or metaphorically; I'm talking literally. At a microcellular level, the infinitely complex network of nerve cells that make up the constituent parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences and stimuli.' The brain, in other words, is malleable - not just in early childhood but right up to early adulthood, and, in certain instances, beyond. The surrounding environment has a huge impact both on the way our brains develop and how that brain is transformed into a unique human mind. Of course, there's nothing new about that: human brains have been changing, adapting and developing in response to outside stimuli for centuries. But in the last century, development of new technologies has increased dramatically. 'This will affect our brains over the next 100 years in ways we might never have imagined,' she said. 'Our brains are under the influence of an ever- expanding world of new technology: multichannel television, video games, MP3 players, the internet, wireless networks, Bluetooth links - the list goes on and on. 'This games-driven generation interpret the world through screen-shaped eyes. It's almost as if something hasn't really happened until it's been posted on Facebook, Bebo or YouTube. 'We could be raising a hedonistic generation who live only in the thrill of the computer-generated moment, and are in distinct danger of detaching themselves from what the rest of us would consider the real world.' 'Electronic devices and pharmaceutical drugs all have an impact on the micro- cellular structure and complex biochemistry of our brains. And that, in turn, affects our personality, our behaviour and our characteristics. In short, the modern world could well be altering our human identity.'","Researchers observed random parents with children at NY playgrounds .

"The monkeys of northern India's Shimla region have a fearsome reputation - and as this video shows, for a very good reason. A teenager in the area has discovered the hard way that the locals should not be toyed with after his affront to a monkey left him sprawled on his back. Footage captured on a CCTV camera near an office in Shimla, India, shows the playful monkey first jumping onto a ledge to watch pedestrians wander past. Scroll down for video . The teenager wanders past the monkey, who eyeballs him from a ledge as he gives it the middle finger . Much like a human, the monkey interprets the gesture as an insult and responds by throwing himself at the teenager . Catching the teenager off guard, it lands with its feet directly in his face . He is sent sprawling onto the ground, while the monkey quickly bounds back up again to the ledge . It is then the monkey finds himself in a stare down with the young man - who rather cheekily, gives it the middle finger believing it will do no harm. What he didn't anticipate was the monkey rearing its tail, bearing its fangs and launching itself at his face - taking him by surprise and sending him sprawling onto his back. Although he walked away from the incident unharmed, he sat in a state of shock for several moments while the monkey returned to his perch. Those familiar with the Shimla region will be unsurprised - the monkeys of the area have a terrifying reputation. They are known to roam about in gangs, stealing tourists' food and rummaging through bags and even peoples' pockets in order to take valuables such as phones and cameras. Monkey bites across the area are common and in some instances, they have caused deaths when people attempting to flee them have fallen from heights. The monkeys of the Shimla region, such as the one featured in this video, have a reputation for aggression .","Teenager was caught on CCTV giving the middle finger to monkey in India .

"Meet the Australian families who take their pet kangaroos on walks to the beach, go away on holidays  and even attend weddings with their owners as their plus-one. They eat and live like cats and dogs, grow up learning how to hop, let their owners give them regular baths, sneak into the kitchen for snacks, take naps and mingle with other pets. Samantha Wills, from Williamstown in South Australia, welcomed the joey dubbed 'Crash' into her family after he was thrown from his mother’s pouch when she was hit by a car. ‘He looked battered, bruised and I really didn't think he was going to survive when I found him but with a lot of love, care and research, I got him back to great health,’ Ms Wills told Daily Mail Australia.

'He used to visit my nan, who adored him, at a nursing home and he would also keep all the elderly people entertained in there - they all loved him. 'When nan passed away a few weeks ago, Crash went to her funeral.' While kangaroos are known to grown as big as 1.8 metres tall, Ms Wills said her family are enjoying their time with Crash while he is small. 'We're not sure what the future will bring because he will get really big,' she said. Bath time: Wally the wallaby going in for his regular baths .

For people who are interested in owning a pet kangaroo, Ms Nellist said she would definitely recommend it to everyone. 'I think everyone needs to see the natives from a different perspective,' she said. 'People often get the impression they are a pest, or they are inadequate but they have the right to be here. 'They definitely deserve more respect than what they get, and I think if more people got up close to them, and saw them the way I see them, they could really appreciate them.

"Peter Moore (above), from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, received a letter from HM Revenue and Customs last week telling him he had died . A father-of-two has been sent a letter from the Government telling him he is dead. Peter Moore was shocked after receiving the document from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) last week. The letter was addressed to the 'representative' of Peter William John Moore and apologised for the family's 'recent bereavement'. It added that officials needed to sort out whether Mr Moore had paid enough - or too much - tax. The 47-year-old pottery factory worker, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, yesterday demanded an apology from the Government. He said: 'I don't know how that kind of mistake could have been made. 'I used to work away in the week so if that would have happened my wife could have really started to worry. ‘She opened the letter when I was out of the house. Fortunately I came back home about five minutes after she read it so she knew it was a mistake but that might not have always been the case. 'I rang the tax people and the lady on the other end said she couldn't believe it. I was just really shocked, it's just all a bit strange.' Mr Moore's wife Debbie, an accounts assistant, said she was left ‘gobsmacked’ until her husband walked through the door. The 43-year-old added: 'It's really not nice getting a letter from HMRC - especially when what they're saying hasn't really happened. I was gobsmacked. 'When I read it I thought it was a scam or some sort of joke. I showed it to Pete when he came in and he got straight on the phone to the tax office.' The letter from the Government department read: 'I am sorry to hear about your recent bereavement and recognise that this is a difficult time for you.

"Bulgarians love their traditional music. They have a TV channel devoted to it, and one show – a sort of Bulgaria’s Got Talent for folk acts – features people of all ages swaying in stately unison. Indeed, they are so proud of the music that when asked to include something in the capsule aboard the Voyager 2 space probe, they sent tracks from the album Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares, in the hope that aliens would like it too. Colourful outfits! Villagers dressed in the traditional Bulgarian costume . I love this kind of folklore as long as it really is part of the local culture and not just put on for tourists. In Bulgaria it is genuine: practically every village in the mountains has at least one choir, and their own particular variation of traditional dress, and many hold festivals in the way that English villages stage fetes. When I decided to go to Bulgaria I looked for a holiday combining exploring the remote southern mountains with a festival. Despite much trawling on the internet, I couldn’t find a package on the right dates, so instead I combined a group walking tour with an independent excursion of my own. I began by joining a group of 11 other walkers, led by a guide who, it turned out, danced as naturally as she walked. We stayed in a village called Yagodina high in the remote Rodopi mountains. Golden wonder! The autumnal colours shine on the Rodopi mountains in Bulgaria . Apart from the hotel, Yagodina was totally devoid of any tourist infrastructure. The hole in the wall was not a cash machine but a spring. For the people living there, the end of communism did not appear to have resulted in a dramatic increase in consumer choice – the only two shops sold the barest of necessities. Each morning we set off through pine forests and scrambled above the tree line to meadows so full of wild flowers that I counted 22 varieties in one square metre as I was having my picnic. We walked up to nine miles every day. The level of difficulty was described as ‘moderate’ but I found it quite challenging. Unlike most of the other members of the group, I didn’t have walking poles, so I picked up two sticks and tapped along until I got into a rhythm. Yagodina Cave in Rhodope Mountains in part of the Trigrad Gorge and was the result of an earthquake that made the huge cave in the marble bed of a river . On the way down, we walked past fields of potatoes – the staple diet in the mountains – and through Muslim villages, a legacy of the Ottoman empire. It was easy to see why folklore survived in these places as they are so cut off from the outside world. At the end of one walk we scrambled down to the Yagodina cave system, its luminescent stalactites and stalagmites dripping eerily as they have done for millions of years. Evidence of prehistoric man was displayed almost casually, including a mug with a handle that looks as if it could be used to served tea today. Picturesque scenery! Old stone bridge and mountain stream near the cave of Yagodina . On my last evening, a group of villagers came to the hotel to entertain us. Rashly, some of us agreed to put on traditional costumes too and dance rather inelegantly with them. When I came to leave the group the next morning, I had to sign a release form saying I was responsible for my own actions, which made my trip to the festival seem more adventurous than it really was. I splashed out on a cheap taxi for the trip across the mountains to the ski resort of Bankso (the one place I don’t want to go back to). Next morning, things became more difficult as the locals use the Cyrillic alphabet which I found impenetrable, so I couldn’t read the destination on the bus timetable. Trees covered in a fresh snowfall on Todorin Vrah, in the Pirin Mountains . Fortunately, a woman, who told me in broken English that her daughter was picking tomatoes in Chichester, spooned me on to a crowded minibus to the Pirin mountains. Through the trees came the sound of singing and the banging of drums. Each village had a stage of its own where its people performed their songs and were awarded certificates for participating. Traditionally, women aren’t allowed to play instruments so they sang while the men played flutes, fiddles and drums. Traditional Bulgarian national costume worn by villagers in the Pirin mountains . It was a joyous occasion, put on for their own pleasure, not for tourists. Once the certificates had been awarded, everyone joined in, regardless of whether they were wearing traditional costume or jeans. I resisted invitations to dance and just sat and watched. A young teacher said she ‘revered’ their customs. ‘I hope you are getting a good impression of Bulgaria,’ she said. I certainly was.

"What does Republican senator and presidential contender Rand Paul have in common with a gun-toting, stripper-hurling playboy? An avid interest in poker, as it turns out.

"A married Maths teacher at Max Clifford's old school is facing jail for groping a 15-year-old pupil in his car. Paul Shorter had a series of liaisons with the schoolgirl, who he was giving one-to-one tuition in a 'serious' breach of his position of trust at Rydens School in Hersham, Surrey. Guildford Crown Court heard the 31-year-old kissed the teenager after class and also groped her in his car. Married Paul Shorter (left), who was a teacher at convicted sex offender Max Clifford's (right) former school in Hersham, Surrey, is facing jail after admitting a string of sex offences . The father-of-one, of Addlestone, Surrey, looked shaken and spoke softly as he admitted two counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. The judge was told that the girl had not wanted a sexual relationship with Shorter and on one occasion had stormed out of a personal tuition session when he tried to grope her. But that one the instances in question, which took place between December 13, 2013 and January 19 last year, there was 'ostensible consent.' Shorter's pregnant wife Joanne, who is expecting his child in six weeks, and other members of his family watched from the public gallery as the charges against him were read out. But Judge Noel Lucas ruled that Shorter could not be sentenced until a victim impact statement had been taken from the girl to find out how his crimes had affected her. The pair met because Shorter was her Maths teacher at the school, which counts convicted sex offender Max Clifford. The 31-year-old Maths teacher kissed the teenager after class at Rydens School in Hersham, Surrey (pictured) Disgraced PR guru  Clifford, 71, was jailed in May last year after being convicted of a string of indecent assaults between 1977 and 1984. Judge Lucas passed an indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order banning Shorter from working with children or having unsupervised contact with anybody under the age of 18. The court heard the former teacher, who has been on bail for the past 15 months, had found 'gainful employment' in a trade that did not bring him into contact with minors. The judge was told he has also been paying to see a psychologist, in a bid to help him to fight depression. Judge Lucas said: 'I am of course sympathetic to the defendant's wife and the situation but your client must be under no illusion that the sentence I pass is likely to be nothing less than an immediate custodial sentence.'

"At his lowest point in the 1980s, Bruce Jenner wanted to flee to Europe for gender reassignment surgery and return to America as his children's Aunt Heather. That was around the time his young sons asked their mother why their father had breasts. As Diane Sawyer's explosive tell-all with Bruce came to an end last night, his second wife published a blog detailing their love affair, idyllic marriage and the gender dysphoria revelations that led to their divorce after two sons and a seemingly picture perfect Malibu life. Linda Thompson, now 64, met Bruce at the Playboy mansion when he was separated from his first wife, Chrystie Crownover, the mother of his two eldest children. They fell in love and got married in Hawaii when she was already pregnant with their son Brandon. A few years later they welcomed a second son together, Brody. Scroll down for video . Former couple: Bruce Jenner and Linda Thompson (seen together) met at the Playboy mansion. They fell in love and got married when she was already pregnant with their first son, Brandon. They later had another son . As Linda wrote on the Huffington Post, 'Those were the happiest days of my life. I had a wonderful husband, who was the most athletic, high-spirited, energetic, easygoing, manly man imaginable. I had two beautiful, healthy baby boys. I had two great stepchildren. Life was just about as good as it gets.' Bruce was travelling the world doing paid appearances and lived a glamorous life in Malibu, frequently seeing his elder son, Burt, and daughter, Casey, from his first marriage. But when Brody was 18 months old and Brandon was three, Bruce revealed to Linda the secret that he finally told the world Friday night. She was, she insists, blindsided. With a 'somber look' Bruce told Linda - who had braced herself for the revelation of perhaps an affair - that he identified as a woman. 'What do you mean you identify as a woman?' she recalled asking. 'What does that mean? And just as he told Diane Sawyer, Bruce told his wife of four plus years that as long as he could remember, he felt wrong with the reflection staring back at him in the mirror. According to Linda, her handsome husband told her, 'I have lived in the wrong skin, the wrong body, my whole life. It is a living hell for me, and I really feel that I would like to move forward with the process of becoming a woman, the woman I have always been inside.' She insists she never saw it coming and there were no signs. Family: The couple's youngest son, Brody (left), was 18 months old and Brandon (right) was three when Bruce revealed to Linda (center) the secret that he finally told the world Friday night - that he identified as a woman . 'Champion': On Friday, Linda, now aged 64, took to Instagram to express her support for her former husband . Unlike Bruce's third wife Kris, who walked in on Jenner in a dress, Linda says there was no evidence he had ever raided her closet or wore any women's clothes. 'No. Not a clue. Nothing. Nada. Never,' she said. The couple entered therapy after Linda found someone who specialized in gender dysphoria, and the doctor 'broke my heart into a million pieces.' She quotes the doctor as telling the couple of the sobering suicide statistics of transgender people at the time - 25 per cent committed suicide- and told Linda she could stay with Bruce as he became a 'she' or Linda could divorce him. But she couldn't change Bruce. While the couple was gutting it out in therapy for six months in a bid to save their marriage, Linda writes, Bruce was struggling. According to Linda, Bruce 'considered traveling out of the country, possibly to Denmark, to have the gender-confirmation surgery and then come back to the U.S. identifying as female.' With four little ones running around under the age of ten, she didn't understand how that would work. ''What about the children?' He thought maybe he could reenter their lives as 'Aunt Heather.'' While she says he referred to himself as Heather at the time, he never revealed his female name to Diane Sawyer, referring to that identity as just 'She'. As Linda writes, she sobbed endlessly and was despondent about the end of her marriage, but as devastated as she was, her 'heart bled for Bruce'. Linda decided she didn't want to be married to a woman, their marriage ended, and a few years later, she married music producer David Foster. In the years during and after the couple split, Bruce started taking female hormones. He detailed to Diane that period in the '80s, saying that the hormones quieted and calmed his mind, while his breasts grew to a size 36B during the five years that he was taking them. Linda remembers the time well, too, and also remembers the lengths he went to in order to change his macho facade. Tearful: Bruce revealed that he identifies as a woman in his explosive interview with Diane Sawyer last night . Transitioning: 'One day, after having spent a little time at Bruce's house, both boys came into the kitchen and said to me, 'Mommy, we saw Daddy getting out of the shower naked, and Daddy has boobs!' writes Linda . 'Thirty years ago the only hair removal that was permanent was electrolysis,' Linda writes. 'Poor Bruce began the process of having electrolysis performed on his heavily bearded face. He then began having the hair on his chest removed.' And she - and their children - couldn't miss his newfound bosom. Linda writes that she had an open door policy for Bruce to see his children, and he was welcome to visit Brandon and Brody anytime. But, and she doesn't detail why, the boys never spent the night at Bruce's house and occasionally visited. Most likely it was to shield them, as an anecdote about seeing their father undressed led to a lot of confusion. 'One day, after having spent a little time at Bruce's house, both boys came into the kitchen and said to me, 'Mommy, we saw Daddy getting out of the shower naked, and Daddy has boobs!' And so she tried to cover for Bruce, their father. 'Well, boys, you know how your dad was super-muscular and trained very hard for the Olympics? He had big muscles, and some of those muscles are called 'pectorals.' When you stop training and you stop lifting weights, sometimes the muscle turns to fat. So his pectoral muscles have probably just gotten a little flabby and look like boobs.' Soon enough, the exhausting coverup of his transition ended, and it wasn't Bruce's gender dysphoria Linda was protecting them from. Bruce stopped taking hormones, didn't go to Denmark, and started dating again. A source told ET he had his breasts reduced. According to Bruce during his ABC interview, he chickened out of going through with it and stopped taking the hormones. Linda then strongly hints that Kris knew more about Bruce's gender identity crisis than Bruce let on to during the Diane Sawyer interview. Support: On the Diane Sawyer episode, Brody and Brandon both sit proudly alongside their father, supporting him fully as he enters the next phase of life as 'She'. And their mother also wishes Bruce well . Linda's second husband David foster showed his support for Bruce after the interview. David was Brody and Brandon's stepfather for 14 years- including the time Bruce cut the boys off. 'Bruce dated several women, even though he had begun his transition and showed signs of it. He had no facial hair, no chest hair, and boobs, and he had gotten a nose job and trimmed his Adam's apple. 'Clearly he was still confused and conflicted as to how fully he was ready to commit to changing his life completely.' Then he married Kris and stopped seeing his sons, the sons who'd seen his breasts, for years. 'After Bruce and Kris married, there were periods of several years going by without Bruce attempting to contact or visit his sons. No birthday cards or phone calls, no ""Merry Christmas"", no ""Everything OK?"" after the big Northridge earthquake. Nothing.' But, in hindsight, Linda believes, the revelation of what her sons' father was struggling with, and running away from, in the years he vanished from their lives, helps explain a lot. On the Diane Sawyer episode, Brody and Brandon both sit proudly with their father, supporting him fully as he enters the next phase of life as 'She'. And their mother also wishes him well. Linda took to Instagram to support him on Friday, hours before the TV show aired, writing: 'Once a champion of Olympian magnitude...now a champion for those who share the struggle to just be who they are. #compassion #acceptance #tolerance #education #evolution #kindness #inclusion.' And she ends her blog, 'I can now breathe a little easier, knowing he now has found the strength and the courage to fulfill his dream.' Linda divorced David Foster in 2005.","Linda Thompson, now 64, was married to Bruce Jenner from 1981 to '86 .

"Luke Shaw admitted he has struggled to cope with the demands of playing for Manchester United after he returned to the team against Chelsea. Shaw has started seeing a psychologist in recent weeks as he comes to terms with his £28million move from Southampton to Old Trafford in the summer. The left back, who had a decent game on his return to the team at Stamford Bridge, said: 'I am still young and coming to the biggest club in the world hasn't been easy for me. Manchester United left back Luke Shaw (right) chases the ball ahead of Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic (left) Shaw (right) tussles with Chelsea forward Eden Hazard (left) during the Premier League match on Saturday . Shaw admits that he has struggled to live up to his £28million price tag since joining Manchester United . 'I wouldn't say it has been a hard three weeks but it has been a three weeks that I have been able to learn a lot more about myself, so it has been a nice three weeks in that respect and good to get on the pitch again.' Shaw claims he had a minor back injury when he was substituted at half-time against Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-final defeat at Old Trafford last month, but he was left out of the team by Louis van Gaal for the next four games. Shaw added: 'He has two sides to him, but he is genuinely a really nice guy and a great manager. 'You have seen what he has turned United into in recent weeks but that is because there is a really focused side, where you have to give 100 per cent in every training session and game and be focused all the time. 'If you don't give that, he won't play you and that's what he is like.' The 19-year-old has played 19 times in all competitions for United this campaign, after featuring in twice as many matches for Southampton last season. 'I haven't been playing and there have been a lot of negative comments about me,' he said. 'It is something that isn't nice and I've tried to ignore it but hopefully this is the start of me coming back. 'I saw a comment the other day saying I was taken off at half-time against Arsenal because I wasn't fit enough, but that's not true at all. 'This is coming from me and I know what the manager pulled me off for and it was not for my fitness because I could have carried on in the game.'

Despite his up-and-down start at Old Trafford, Shaw insists he has the full support of Van Gaal. 'Over the last three weeks I have learned a lot from the manager and credit goes to him for trusting me in a big game like this,' said Shaw. 'I have family and friends who are helping me on my journey and the manager has been unbelievable as well.'

"Two  Air Force nuclear missile launch officers who are facing drug charges related to ecstasy, cocaine and bath salts now face hearings to determine whether they will be court-martialed. 1st Lt Michael Alonso and 1st Lt Lantz Balthazar have been charged in cases stemming from an investigation that led to the disclosure last year of a separate exam-cheating scandal. One of their fellow missile officers who was a target of the same investigation pleaded guilty to illegal drug use in January and was kicked out of the service, the Air Force said on Friday. 1st Lt Michael Alonso and 1st Lt Lantz Balthazar of Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana have been charged . Alonso and Balthazar are both members of the 12th Missile Squadron at the 341st Missile Wing at the base . Alonso and Balthazar are both members of the 12th Missile Squadron at the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The Malmstrom missile wing operates 150 of the Air Force's 450 Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. Launch officers are trained to operate ICBMs that are armed with nuclear warheads and are on constant alert for possible launch. Alonso was charged with violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for illegal possession, use and distribution of ecstasy and for 'conspiracy related to the drug offenses', according to Malmstrom spokesman Josh Aycock. Balthazar was charged with illegal possession, use and distribution of ecstasy and cocaine and for conspiracy related to the drug offenses. He also was charged with illegal use of Pentedrone, which Aycock said is commonly called bath salts. Both officers were charged April 17. Malmstrom's missile wing operates 150 of the Air Force's 450 Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missiles . Aycock said their cases will be reviewed at Article 32 hearings, which are akin to a civilian grand jury proceeding, to determine whether there is enough criminal evidence to warrant a court-martial. The hearings have not been scheduled, Aycock said. Alonso and Balthazar were among three Minuteman 3 launch officers at Malmstrom who were under investigation for illegal drug use. The other, 2nd Lt Nicole Dalmazzi, was charged in December and court-martialed in January. Dalmazzi, a member of the same squadron, pleaded guilty to illegal use of ecstasy and was dismissed from the Air Force and sentenced to a month of confinement in a Montana jail. The Air Force had also charged her with obstructing the Air Force Office of Special Investigations probe by allegedly dyeing her hair to alter the results of hair-follicle drug tests, but that charge was later dropped. The cases at Malmstrom stem from a drug investigation that began in August 2013 at Edwards Air Force Base in California. When investigators examined the cellphones of two airmen at Edwards they found text messages to or from 11 other Air Force officers at several other air bases, including Malmstrom. The messages allegedly detailed specific illegal drug use and led to the discovery that some had also improperly exchanged answers to ICBM launch officer proficiency tests. The ICBM force, which also operates from bases in Wyoming and North Dakota, has been under the public spotlight in recent years for a series of embarrassing missteps related to low morale, disciplinary problems, a lack of resources, training lapses and leadership failures. Last November, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced plans for top-to-bottom changes in management of nuclear forces and said the Pentagon would spend $8billion to fix it. In testimony to a Senate panel this week, an administration official who headed a detailed review of the nuclear forces for Hagel last year said her group believed that as much as $25billion could be needed to fix an array of problems. 'The problems that we found were worse and they were much more systemic' than expected, Madelyn Creedon said in her testimony Wednesday. Creedon, who was head of the Pentagon's nuclear policy shop at the time and is now principal deputy administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, said her review found morale in the nuclear Air Force was 'not good.' Nuclear missile crews told her they 'felt trapped' in their job. 'They would say, 'Well, I have the nuclear stink on me so I don't have much of a future in the rest of the Air Force,'' she said. The Air Force says it has begun to change that attitude by implementing a range of changes and improvements that are being felt across the force.

"Colin Shearing, 70, fled across the Channel to Paris to avoid being jailed for a sex attack. File photo . A paedophile author has fled to France to avoid being jailed for a sex attack on a six-year-old girl. A European arrest warrant has been issued for Colin Shearing, 70, who failed to turn up to court yesterday to be sentenced. He was convicted of indecent assault and had been given a week on bail to 'put his personal matters in order.' But Swansea Crown Court heard that he had crossed the Channel and booked a room at the Hotel des Nation in Paris. He then moved to a second hotel and then to a third in a bid to stay one step ahead of the police, who are hunting him across the continent. Judge Huw Davies issued a European-wide warrant for Shearing's arrest. The court heard he twice assaulted the girl more than 20 years ago and was sentenced to three years prison in his absence. But he will now also receive an additional sentence for absconding once he has been found. Judge Davies said Shearing, of Chichester, Sussex, had shown 'absolutely no remorse' for what he had done. Shearing, who is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, agreed that among his books, which are published under the name Colin King, there was a passage dealing with children having sex together. The court heard that Shearing booked himself into the Hotel des Nations in Paris (pictured) before moving to a second and third hotel to evade police . He agreed that among his books, published under the name Colin King, there was a passage dealing with children having sex together - but he insisted that it was a work of pure fiction. The writer twice assaulted the girl in the 1980s. She revealed that memories of the assault came back to her years later and she was driven to complain when she discovered Shearing had become involved with a youth theatre. Shearing has been ordered to register as a sex offender.

"One of Britain's top entrepreneurs has unveiled a new plan to build a block of flats worth as much as £2billion on the site of an ugly multi-storey car park. John Caudwell, the founder of Phones4U, bought the Audley Street garage in Mayfair, central London for £155million in order to knock it down and build a high-end housing complex. The new apartment block will contain five townhouses, three penthouses, a mews home and 21 more luxury flats, rivalling properties such as One Hyde Park for the title of the world's most desirable living space. Luxury: Audley Square House is set to be a complex of houses, luxury flats and penthouses in Mayfair, central London . Contrast: Most of the plot is currently taken up by an ugly parking garage which is set to be knocked down by owner John Caudwell . But it could face trouble getting planning permission - as VIP neighbours may object to the building works needed to build four levels of basements as well as nine storeys above the ground. Each townhouse and penthouse will have its own gym and swimming pool, while the penthouses will have dedicated lifts to ensure their owners' privacy. Entrepreneur: The Phones4U founder, pictured with his partner Claire Johnson, is known as a prolific investor in Mayfair property . The development's communal facilities will include a 15-metre swimming pool, a business centre for holding meetings, a gym, spa and cinema and games room. Plans for the ambitious complex were submitted to Westminster Council this week after being put together by US architects RAMSA, which beat 30 rivals to the job. Audley Square House is regarded as a 'super prime' scheme - with one agent saying it could reach £10,000 per sq/ft, valuing it at £2billion in total. Becky Fatemi, director of Rokstone estate agents, said Audley Square House was 'one of the most exciting residential projects ever unveiled in London'. She estimated it would sell for £5,500-£7,000 per sq/ft, rising as high as £10,000 per sq/ft in the next few years. Ms Fatemi said: 'John Caudwell's visionary proposals will replace an unsightly multi-storey concrete car park at 5 Audley Square and convert it into a super-prime residential project. 'The Audley Square project will create a new luxury village for Mayfair and will rival One Hyde Park as London's best luxury address.' Susan Cohen from Mayfair-based Pastor Real Estate said: 'Speculation on plans to develop the Audley Square car park have been going almost as long as I've been in Mayfair, long before the £150 million deal to purchase the site in 2011. 'There have been many twists and turns, initially refused by the planning officer, Westminster council then overturned this, now the plans have been revised and resubmitted. 'Whatever happens, due to the scale of investment already ploughed into this I don't doubt the finished development will be one of the most super-prime schemes in Mayfair.' Desirable: The complex is set to fetch as much as £2billion in total when it goes on to the market, according to one estate agent . Plan: This map shows how the development will include five townhouses as well as a courtyard garden . Towering: The property will reach nine storeys, as well as four basement levels to be excavated below ground . Mark Tunstall of Tunstall Property added: 'Mayfair is becoming increasingly residential as commercial leases granted after World War II on previously residential addresses come to an end and those properties are reinstated to their original use. 'Yet where it has lagged behind other areas such as Knightsbridge and Belgravia is in its provision of 21st century full-service apartment buildings. 'What Mayfair has lacked until now is a building to rival One Hyde Park and 199 Knightsbridge. Audley Square is set to be a game changer.' Mr Caudwell, 62, has previously described the location as being 'the best site in the world but with some of the ugliest buildings', and promised his stone-clad development will be 'very beautiful'. Contrast: This image shows how the huge building will tower over the street it is on, compared to the modest development there now . Stylish: Mr Caudwell claims that many buildings in the area are very ugly and is keen to restore the district's elegance . Overhaul: The vista will be almost unrecognisable when the complex is built - but it has to get planning permission first . He does not plan to include any affordable housing as part of the complex - and will instead pay Westminster Council more than £8million in compensation. If the property is sold for its maximum price, the Treasury could gain as much as £100million in stamp duty. However, Ms Fatemi warned that powerful locals might not be happy with the years of building works which would be likely to ensue in the area. 'The project will have a lower ground floor and four basement levels, this will be a major engineering scheme,' she said. 'The neighbours are powerful and include the Embassy of Qatar, the Dorchester Hotel and very wealthy apartment owners who will expect the site construction to be managed to the highest levels to ensure no noise or construction impact and they will expect constantly clean roads.' Map: Another projection of how the finished development will look which was submitted to Westminster Council planners . Eyesore: The current car park is an undistinguished modern building with a monolithic brick frontage . Mr Caudwell has previously made a number of significant investments in Mayfair - he is currently spending millions on converting two houses into a single mega-mansion, and he also owns the house next to Audley Square, which has been rented out for £15,000 per week. A spokesman for the development project declined to comment on the newly revealed plans. Billionaire: Mr Caudwell founded Phones4U and sold his business for £1.5billion . John Caudwell rose from humble beginnings to become one of the wealthiest men in Britain thanks to the Phones4U business empire. He left school before taking his A-levels and worked as an apprentice at Michelin - but while working at the tyre firm, he started a mail-order business selling clothing to motorbike fans. Mr Caudwell was living in a caravan when he and his brother cooked up a plan to sell mobile phones, then considered an expensive luxury with huge profit margins. In 1987 He bought 26 phones from Motorola and took eight months to sell them all, but that turned out to be the origins of a company which would help define the burgeoning mobile market. Nearly 20 years later, Mr Caudwell cashed out by selling the last of his businesses for £1.5billion, and at that point he became a noted philanthropist, giving to causes such as the NSPCC and the Bomber Command memorial. He has a son with his partner Claire Johnson, as well as four other children from previous relationships. Last year his son Rufus revealed that he was struggling with agoraphobia, and finds it almost impossible to leave the house. As well as his properties in Mayfair, Mr Caudwell owns 50-room Broughton Hall in Staffordshire, where he is currently building a private miniature railway to transport him and his guests around the estate.","John Caudwell has bought a car park in Audley Street, Mayfair and is planning to replace it with a huge block of flats .

"It was one of the most horrific disasters of the First World War, which still haunts the descendants of those who died. Yesterday, as commemorations were held all over the world to mark the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign, the Royal Family led tributes to those who fought and fell in the ill-fated offensive. The day began in London with a dawn ceremony at Wellington Arch on Hyde Park Corner, attended by Princess Anne. Later the Queen, joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince William and political leaders, led the nation during a ceremony at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, while Prince Charles was in Turkey with Prince Harry.

The national flags of Australia, New Zealand, Turkey and the UK were carried through the Abbey and placed close to the high altar as a sign of reconciliation between old enemies. Earlier, Charles and Harry joined more than 10,000 people in a dawn pilgrimage at Gallipoli to honour the bravery of the Allied troops who stormed the peninsula's beaches in 1915. The landings were supposed to be a decisive blow that would knock the Turks out of the war. But eight months of bloody fighting later, after an estimated 145,000 lives on both sides had been lost, the Allies pulled out, having failed in their objective. Around 58,000 Allied troops were killed, many from Australia and New Zealand. Almost 36,000 Commonwealth servicemen are buried or commemorated on Gallipoli. Prince Charles gave a moving reading about troops weeping as they left their dead comrades behind when they left Gallipoli. He read the words of a soldier, who wrote: 'The hardest feature of the evacuation was in leaving those dead comrades behind. They had bequeathed us a sacred trust.'

"Helping children to get safely to school as a lollipop man might seem the ideal job for an active pensioner nearing his 80th birthday. But John Doyle, 79, was left with a punctured lung and a broken rib after he was beaten up by an angry driver during a terrifying road rage attack. The grandfather was ushering two 12-year-old girls across the road when businessman Genti Rustemi, 45, drove over the crossing point without slowing. Genti Rustemi, 45, (left) left John Doyle, 79, (right) with a broken rib and a punctured lung after attacking the lollipop man as he helped children cross the road to get to school . Mr Doyle was helping youngsters cross the road to Wellington School in Timperley, Greater Manchester (pictured), where his wife is a dinnerlady . To show his disapproval, Mr Doyle tapped his lollipop stick on the roof of the BMW as it hurtled past and then, when the driver stopped, told him to be more careful. But after Rustemi had dropped off his daughter at a different school, he returned to the crossing minutes later in a fit of temper and attacked Mr Doyle, who was still helping pupils cross the road. As children and parents looked on in horror, the incensed businessman threw a punch towards Mr Doyle’s face. It failed to connect but managed to knock off his glasses. He then punched Mr Doyle in the chest causing him to fall over backwards into the road where he sat gasping for breath. The former pub landlord was taken to hospital where he was found to have suffered a fractured rib and a punctured lung. Kosovo-born Rustemi, from Stockport, escaped a jail sentence this week after admitting assault causing actual bodily harm and dangerous driving. Instead, he was handed a six-month suspended jail term, ordered to pay Mr Doyle £2,000 in compensation, told to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and banned from the roads for 12 months. Mr Doyle (pictured at the scene of the attack) was helping two 12 year old girls across the road outside their school, when Rustemi drove over the crossing without slowing . Mr Doyle took the post as a 'patrol crossing officer' three years ago to to stave off boredom during retirement . Mr Doyle, who has been married for 55 years to Jean, 80, a dinner lady, took the job as a ‘patrol crossing officer’ three years ago to stave off boredom during retirement. Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester heard that the incident happened at 8.30am on January 20 while he was working outside Wellington School, a secondary school, in Timperley, Greater Manchester. Yesterday Mr Doyle, who had to take six weeks off work following the attack, said: ‘It was an extraordinary thing. I’ve spent most of my working life in the licence trade so I’ve had to escort my fair share of people from my premises but this was something else. 'What he did was like going through a red light. Both myself and the children could have been run over. I’ve been verbally abused in the past but I never expected to get hit. ‘But I’ll keep doing lollipop patrols until I stop enjoying it, and that’s even after getting a punctured lung. I love the job and love meeting people. I’ve got no plans to stop yet.’ Mr Doyle, who was sent this get well soon card by pupils, said he plans to continue his job as a lollipop man despite being injured by Rustemi . Speaking of the incident, he said: 'I had dropped my lollipop down to draw the driver's attention to the fact I was in the middle of the road with two schoolchildren. 'But he was only about 18 inches away from me as he went by. He asked me what the bloody hell I thought I was doing. I said, ""didn't you see me standing on the road?"" He said ""no"" so I said, ""you should bloody well open your eyes then."" Rustemi tried to argue that Mr Doyle had been the 'aggressor' during the incident, but police took statements from a number of schoolchildren witnesses who said the opposite . 'He drove off and I thought that was it then three or four minutes later he came charging across the road towards me and hit me in the side. Much to my mortification I collapsed. 'I have never experienced anything quite like that. It was just not being able to stand up at again. I was lying on the floor and couldn't stand up. I had to crawl across the pavement to a wall and hauled myself up against it and by this time I had people around me. I didn't think there was proper injury at that point, I was just deeply ashamed that I had fallen and couldn't stand up again. 'It wasn't until later in hospital having an X-ray they discovered that I had broken my rib. I can't imagine anybody would drive away, park the car and come charging back because of a sudden burst of temper. This must have been something that was festering for one reason or another.' Sentencing him the judge Mr Recorder David Heaton QC said: 'You behaved in a way in front of your daughter and in front of other schoolchildren which is repugnant to right-minded people. You drove along the road and it appears you failed to see Mr Doyle, the school crossing patrol man, who at that time was escorting two 12-year-old girls across the road. 'So frustrated was he by your driving that he, perhaps unwisely, allowed his crossing banner to drop on to your vehicle and no doubt that surprised your daughter and caused you to exchange words with him. If matters had rested there I imagine you would not be here. Foolishly, you went away but returned two minutes later, more angry, it appears, than you were previously, and threw a punch at Mr Doyle. 'He was carrying out a public service escorting schoolchildren safely from one side of the road to the other and is a much older man. I am prepared to accept you did not realise at the time but nonetheless an inexcusable feature was his age. 'The service he performed is one which parents of children up and down the country value every morning of the school term. You assaulted a public servant, you did it in front of children in the morning and to a man who was significantly older than you. I note you have not been well and that might be some sort of explanation for this extraordinary behaviour.'","Parent Genti Rustemi 45, dropping off daughter and refused to slow down .

"A school has allowed a pupil who suffers badly with nerves to take her pet Labrador into a GCSE exam to help keep her calm. Rebecca Rice, 16, had tried everything to calm her nerves but knew the only thing that made her feel comfortable was her 11-year-old dog Holly. After confiding in her teacher Lorette Esteve it was decided she could take Holly into the five-minute recorded French oral test. Rebecca Rice, 16, (right) told her French teacher Lorette Esteve (left) that she had struggled with her nerves ahead of her French GCSE oral exam. Ms Esteve advised her to bring her pet dog Holly (middle) to help . Ms Esteve, who is joint head of foreign modern languages at the school, said: 'Over the years, both pupils and teachers have worked hard to reduce the stress involved in the whole experience and tactics include bringing in drinks, lucky key rings and having a friend in the room. 'When Rebecca came to do her speaking exam, though, nothing seemed to work. 'She'd spent hours at home learning what to say, but when faced with the idea of having to sit through the exam she knew that she couldn't do it and I talked through with Rebecca what made her feel comfortable. 'So Rebecca's mum delivered 11-year-old Labrador Holly to school, and Rebecca spent her five minutes with Holly who sat reassuringly at her side - and it worked.' The teenager said: 'Having Holly with me really settled my nerves.' Ms Esteve said staff at Bodmin College in Cornwall have worked with pupils to help combat stress during the busy exam period, including bringing along drinks, a lucky key ring or a friend to sit in the room .","Rebecca Rice, 16, was allowed to take her pet dog into five-minute exam .

"Tom Ince chose not celebrate, nor did 60 or so travelling Blackpool fans who used to cherish his displays. But Derby County very much cheered this emphatic victory that solidified their position in the play-offs and provided a needed tonic after recent headaches. Ince's reluctance to show joy when finding the net in some style against his former club was understandable. Blackpool is where he crafted his game and made his name between 2011 and 2014. Since he left last year, initially on loan to Crystal Palace in January, there has been only despair on the seaside, and this defeat confirmed they would take the Championship wooden spoon. Derby celebrated an emphatic victory over Blackpool that kept their promotion push going . Derby: Grant, Keogh, Shotton, Whitbread, Warnock, Bryson, Hendrick (Thomas 78), Dawkins, Ince (Ward 74), Bent (Russell 68), Lingard. Subs not used: Christie, Forsyth,  Roos,  Albentosa. Goals: Bryson 3, Ince 28, Bent 29, (pen) 65. Blackpool: Parish, Maher (Barkhuizen 54), Clarke, O'Dea, Dunne, Cubero, Perkins, O'Hara, Orlandi, Madine, Cameron (Samuel 69). Subs not used: Oliver, Ferguson,  Telford, Boney, Higham. Referee: Oliver Langford (W Midlands). Attendance: 27,227. Derby, despite their recent troubles, can still look up. An easy win against the division's worst team by far may not vouch for their play-off credentials but the three points help get them there. Steve McClaren, who may be heading to the Premier League no matter what, was unable to field top scorer Chris Martin because of a niggling hamstring injury. But his absence was not crucial, this was over by half-time. Probably after just 2 minutes 29 seconds. That is when Craig Bryson picked the ball up off Jeff Hendrick in the middle of the pitch, strolled forward unchallenged and let fly a shot from 20 yards that bounced into corner of the net. Deadlock broken, the rival fans united in trashing Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston, whose stewardship has sent the club into League One. 'Love Blackpool Hate Oyston,' was a banner held aloft in the sparsely-populated away end. Craig Bryson celebrates after scoring the opening goal as early as the third minute . Tom Ince scored Derby's second goal of the night against his former side at the iPro Stadium . Chants were aired, 'Oyston for Forest' being one of the more printable. Ince's goal came in the 28th minute. He got the ball from Ryan Shotton, danced into the area and curled a wonderful effort inside the far post. How important his eight goals have been since joining on loan from Hull. Ince stayed composed out of respect to the club where he scored 31 goals in 100 league games. Some non-celebrations seem trivial. This, given all Blackpool's fans have suffered, was removing the salt from the wound. A mere 58 seconds later, it was 3-0. Straight from kick-off Charles Dunne sent a backpass into the path of Darren Bent, who finished cleanly. It meant he had scored in four consecutive league appearances for the first time since October 2009. He should have had a second seven minutes after the break. Jesse Lingard picked out Ince, whose shot was saved by Elliot Parish, the ball rebounding back off Ince to Bent six yards out. But the former England striker ballooned his shot high over the bar. He did double his tally in the 65th minute with a thumping penalty after Peter Clarke had fouled Shotton. It was his 12th goal in 15 games since arriving on loan from Aston Villa. Derby will need more of the same to reach the Premier League. For Blackpool, that dream has long faded. Darren Bent celebrates after added a third goal for Derby inside the half-hour mark on Tuesday .

"Sian Harkin, 54, gave £30,000 to a builder using the school chequebook claiming the work was to be carried out at Llwyncelyn Primary School in Porth, when the work was actually carried out at her home . A headteacher who secretly tried to use a school chequebook to pay for thousands of pounds worth of work to be carried out at her family home has been jailed. Married mother-of-two Sian Harkin, 54, abused her position of authority by signing cheques totalling £30,000 to her builder claiming the work was to be carried out at Llwyncelyn Primary School in Porth, Wales. Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard that not only did she use the chequebook of Llwyncelyn Primary when she was headteacher there, but also continued to use it when she moved schools. Harkin claimed the money was to be used to build a rain shelter for waiting parents at Llwyncelyn but the proposed work, which never materialised, was never ratified by governors. Instead, work was carried out at her home in Pontypridd, which she shares with her bank manager husband Anthony and their two children. Rachel Knight, prosecuting, said Harkin skipped procedures and instead issued cheques, even forging the deputy head's name in order to cash one in person. She told the court: 'Despite being seconded to a second school she continued to write cheques from the previous school. 'She took it upon herself to dip into school funds when there was no work done at the school. 'She abused her position of trust. She had significant financial responsibility but defrauded the school and thereby the community.' Ms Knight told the court that cowboy builder Lee Slocombe had carried out £80,000 worth of work at Harkin's home in Pontypridd over an 18-month period from November 2012. Labelled a fraudster and a conman who swindled thousands from victims, Slocombe was jailed for 43 months earlier this year for fraud. In total, Harkin signed six cheques to Slocombe over a six-month period. In August 2013, she gave him a cheque for £6,720, which she claimed in the school books was for a gazebo at Llwyncelyn School, but the cheque bounced as there was no second signatory. She signed another one in September of the same year for £5,000, which was cashed at Cash Converters, in Aberdare, by one of Slocombe's employees. Since there was no second signatory on that one either, staff phoned the school and spoke to Harkin. 'She said the cheque was genuine and that it could be drawn,' said Ms Knight. 'She tried to fob school staff off when they asked her about it saying it was nothing to do with the school.' In total, Harkin (left) signed six cheques to cowboy builder Lee Slocombe (right) totalling £30,000. She 'dabbled' in school funds while headteacher of the primary, a position she had held for nine years . Ms Knight said the bank refused to honour the cheque leaving Cash Converters out of pocket, forcing them to pursue a civil claim. Local authority auditors spoke to Harkin in the autumn and she claimed the cheque was a holding cheque for work to be done in October half-term. The auditor concluded it was an isolated incident and put it down to her naivety and inexperience. 'It was the first trigger in the local authority to indicate something was amiss,' said Ms Knight. In November 2013, Harkin moved to Coedpenmaen Primary School in Pontypridd and in December wrote a cheque for £5,000 for a shelter at Llwyncelyn. The bank refused to honour it but Slocombe took it to Abermarle Bond pawnbrokers in Cardiff, which cashed £2,500 on the basis he would return to get the rest. He never did. Harkin issued another £5,000 cheque later that month, which Slocombe partially cashed. She then issued a further three cheques on the same day on January 3 last year, one for £5,000, which was rejected by the bank and another, which was not presented. The last cheque, for £3,200, Harkin actually took into a Porth bank herself to cash after forging the signature of the deputy head, Susan Jones. 'The defendant was seen making that transaction on CCTV,' said Ms Knight. 'The cheques were signed during the school holidays because she knew there would be no likelihood of being caught by staff.' Slocombe carried out £80,000 worth of work at Harkin's home in Pontypridd (pictured), which she shares with her bank manager husband Anthony and their two children, over an 18-month period from November 2012 . Slocombe  was jailed earlier this year for 43 months for fraud for swindling money from dozens of victims. Pictured: Rubble and building materials remain outside Harkin's family property in Pontypridd, Wales . Harkin was called into a special meeting on January 21 last year and challenged about the irregularities. That led to a criminal investigation and Harkin admitted five counts of fraud and one each of theft and forgery. She told officers that she knew she should not have 'dabbled' in school funds. Marion Lewis, defending, said: 'It is a tragedy to see a woman of her calibre before the criminal court in such serious offences as these. She knows the effect her actions have had on the school and deeply regrets them. 'The effects of her wrongdoing have been devastating. A successful career that she dearly loved has been destroyed. She is thoroughly ashamed. 'She came under Lee Slocombe's spell. He charmed her. Her eyes were not opened until she was confronted with the fact that he had pleaded guilty to offences of fraud. 'She has found it very difficult to come to terms with her own gullibility and feels completely humiliated.' Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard that not only did Harkin use the chequebook of Llwyncelyn Primary School (pictured) when she was headteacher there, but she also continued to use it when she moved schools . Ms Lewis asked for any sentence to be suspended but Judge Richard Twomlow refused her plea and jailed Harkin for 12 months. He told her: 'Not only were you responsible for writing the cheques but you were helping to try to get them cashed from the school account. 'You forged a cheque. Someone else was being dragged in as well as the school to this fraudulent project. 'There were no sufficient funds in the account and there was a risk that the cheques would be cashed making the school account go overdrawn. 'Lee Slocombe may be a fraudster and a plausible man but he was doing work at your house. You must have known that the last thing you were entitled to do was to use school funds to try to help him. 'This was a repeated and persistent breach of a high degree of trust. The school account never had much in it but that did not stop you from trying to access them with varying degrees of success through your own selfish needs because of your feelings for a man who told you he needed money. 'These were deliberate and calculated frauds. You were not duped.' Speaking after the case, her husband Anthony said: 'I want to stress that every penny of the money spent on our house came from my pocket and not from the school's funds. 'I am a bank manager and have proved to police that each pound and penny was met by us. 'What Slocombe did with the money from the school is a mystery. He is very plausible and a convicted fraudster. He said his wife had given Slocombe the money to build a shelter at the school. 'We feel very let down by Slocombe over the two-and-a-bit years he worked with us,"" he added. 'He has conned many, many people out of thousands of pounds. We trusted him as did many other people and were bitterly let down.'","Sian Harkin used school chequebook to pay for £30,000 work on her home .

"Cole Skuse's first Ipswich Town goal, in their win against Cardiff City which kept them in the final playoff spot, was a long time coming but boy was it worth the wait. After 21 months and 82 appearances since he signed from Bristol City in July 2013, Skuse opened his account with a 30-yard effort which could barely have been struck sweeter. The score was already 1-1 when, in the 29th minute, Cardiff defender Bruno Ecuele Manga stretched to clear on the edge of the box and the ball bounced to Skuse, who hit it first time then watched it fly in off the right post.

We needed it, when they scored they had a good period and it changed the dynamic.’ It was a torrid night for Ecuele Manga who was all too easily shrugged away from the ball when Ipswich striker Freddie Sears ran on to a long pass from Christophe Berra, took a touch and then finished low under goalkeeper David Marshall to open the scoring after eight minutes. But five minutes later Cardiff levelled. Scott Malone wonderfully arced a cross from the left which was headed in by Eoin Doyle. Cardiff manager Russell Slade said: ‘We had flagged up certain things before the match, we had to be aware of the long ball to Sears and we also flagged up stopping Skuse. That was disappointing.’ Ipswich restored their lead with Skuse’s strike but Fabio Da Silva, formerly of Manchester United, missed a simple chance to level for Cardiff when he shot wide from three yards. Marshall tipped Daryl Murphy’s powerful header over on 49 minutes and denied Tommy Smith in the 76th before Berra sent the rebound on to the bar. In stoppage time, however, Ipswich finally added a third. Skuse had a chance to shoot from distance and the Portman Road crowd were urging him on, but the midfielder passed to Murphy instead and the striker slotted in.

"Tony Pulis insists West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace has given him his word any takeover will not drag on. Owner Peace is open to offers for the Baggies and is understood to want between £150million and £200million for the club. There is interest from groups from America, Australia and China with Peace setting a June deadline to seal any deal. Tony Pulis insists he has been told by the West Brom chairman that any takeover will not drag on . The Baggies are currently fighting to avoid relegation from the Premier League, and face Liverpool next . And, ahead of Saturday's visit of Liverpool, Pulis does not expect a long saga. He said: 'He's (Peace) given us that promise that he won't be hanging round, if there's an offer there and there's a deal to be done he'll want it done before a certain date and if that doesn't happen then he'll commit himself to the club again. 'I think he wants it to be with the right people. I don't think he wants to sell it to just anybody, they have to be the right people who are going to invest and look after the club. 'He's spent a lot of time here and invested a lot of money into the football club to put it where it is. If you look at the stadium, the academy set up, the training ground facilities and everything else. 'This club has moved on very well and they make a profit every year. So he hasn't done too bad a job.' West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace is open to offers for the Midlands club, but will not let a takeover drag on . Pulis praised West Brom forward Saido Berahino, who has recently been in the news for all the wrong reasons . Pulis also dismissed any worries over Saido Berahino after the striker was shown again inhaling nitrous oxide in a picture taken a year ago. The striker joined Aston Villa's Jack Grealish and Liverpool's Raheem Sterling in having pictures or video of them taking the legal high emerge. Berahino was first shown last year taking the substance and a second picture appeared this week but the Baggies are understood to be happy with the striker's version of events. 'You would have to explain to me what they are doing because I haven't got a clue,' said Pulis. 'It looks like some balloon or something. 'That picture was a year ago. He has been fantastic since I came into the club. 'I've had no problems with him at all and he's played well, and fingers crossed he's going to go to the tournament in the summer with England Under-21s and he will be a big asset to that team. Berahino arrives at Selhurst Park ahead of West Brom's win over Crystal Palace last weekend . Berahino will this weekend come up against Raheem Sterling, who has also been in trouble off the pitch . 'If you watch us train, after every session there will be two or three out there and he will be one of them, doing extra work and he's been first class.' Berahino will face Sterling at The Hawthorns on Saturday and Pulis, who is without the suspended Youssouf Mulumbu and ineligible Andre Wisdom, is looking forward to the showdown. 'They will play and it will be interesting,' he said. 'Sterling has been outstanding. Saido is a little bit behind in some respects but you have to understand and recognise that one of them is playing at a really top club and there is a difference in standard, without a doubt.'","West Brom owner Jeremy Peace is looking to sell the Midlands club .

"Interested parties have begun due diligence on West Brom as the sale of the club edges closer. The Baggies are on the market with chairman Jeremy Peace understood to want between £150million and £200million for the club. Groups from America, Australia and the Far East are believed to be interested in buying Albion after Peace confirmed he would be open to offers in February. West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace is hoping to sell the club for between £150million and £200million . Manager Tony Pulis has been assured that the deal will be done by July, so as not to affect pre-season . He has set a July deadline to complete any deal to ensure it does not drag out and hamper their summer transfer plans under head coach Tony Pulis. Should he fail to sell the club, though, then Peace, who has been chairman for 13 years, will remain committed to Albion, who are on course to seal a sixth straight season in the Barclays Premier League. Pulis said on Monday he was unaware of any imminent sale but Peace has given him assurances it will not drag on over the summer. Any due diligence of the Hawthorns club is likely to be helped after they announced pre-tax profits of £14.7million up to end of June 2014 in February. The Baggies are 13th in the Barclays Premier League, seven points clear of the relegation zone, with four games left and go to Manchester United on Saturday.

"Another trophy slipped through Brendan Rodgers’ grip when they lost to Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Sunday. That elusive first piece of silverware is proving hard to attain and an itch is developing which is in dire need of being scratched. After spending more than £200million since taking charge at Liverpool in June 2012, there is only so long the owners and fans will keep patient in their desire for dividends. Brendan Rodgers gives instructions to Steven Gerrard during Liverpool's defeat against Aston Villa . Rodgers is set for his third season without a trophy after Liverpool were dumped out of the FA Cup . Twitching times can develop when the top clubs go through barren spells - and Rodgers’ is beginning to enter such a period. During Rodgers’ time in charge, Manchester United and Chelsea had spent more than their Merseyside rivals - so too have City by a fraction - but each of those have brought home something. United and City have won two trophies - including the Premier League title - while Chelsea have one and are sure to add the league title to that soon. Arsene Wenger has spent £183m, comparatively little, but managed to win two trophies over the past two seasons. That is less than rivals Tottenham, who have spent just under £200m and, like Liverpool, have won nothing. Alexis Sanchez celebrates his extra-time winner against Reading to seal Arsenal's spot in the FA Cup final . Eden Hazard's first-half strike against Manchester United leaves Chelsea on the brink of winning the title . While the country’s best teams are filling their trophy cabinets, Rodgers’ remains bare. The Red half of Merseyside expect success and landed the League Cup under Kenny Dalglish just before Rodgers took to the helm. Analysis by Sportsmail indicates that he has signed 22 players during his tenure, but only seven of those can be considered a success at this current time. His top signings have been Daniel Sturridge, Philippe Coutinho and Simon Mignolet, but the poor transfers outweigh the successful ones. Rogers has gone for top young talent, ranging from 18 to 21 when he signs them. There is still time for some of those players - the likes of Joao Teixeira and Divock Origi - to prove their worth. But there will be only so much time. Many of his big-money failures came last summer, when he tried to spend the money accrued from selling Luis Suarez to Barcelona for £75m. Adam Lallana, Lazar Markovic, Dejan Lovren and Mario Balotelli have all disappointed this term. Like the younger potentials, each of those could still make their mark, but the question is if it does not come together next season - and they remain trophyless again - will Rogers still be in charge to reap any of the rewards? Philippe Coutinho, Mario Balotelli and Jordan Henderson reflect on Liverpool's semi-final defeat on Sunday . Summer 2012 . Fabio Borini, Roma, £10.5m . Farmed out to Sunderland for the whole of last season on loan then failed to secure a move away from Liverpool but has scored just once this season as a bit-part player. VERDICT: MISS . Joe Allen, Swansea, £15m . One of Rodgers’ first signings after he raided his former club. The plucky midfielder has not been spectacular so far but has still been a solid acquisition. VERDICT: HIT . Fabio Borini, pictured in action against Newcastle earlier this month, has scored just one goal for Liverpool . Joe Allen tackles Christian Benteke in Liverpool's defeat; he has proved to be one of Rodgers' best buys . Oussama Assaidi, Heerenveen, £2.4m . Failed to make a Premier League start at Liverpool, having more joy in two loan spells at Stoke, and was sold to Al Ahli in January. VERDICT: MISS . Samed Yesil, Bayer Leverkusen, £1m . Still only 20, this signing could well come to fruition at a later stage, especially if some of his performances for the club's Under-21 side are anything to go by. But has made only two appearances for the first team, both in the League Cup. VERDICT: MISS . January 2013 . Daniel Sturridge, Chelsea, £12m . Who says January transfers never work? Went on to score 11 goals in 16 Liverpool games in the second half of the season after signing and has become one of Europe’s top strikers. VERDICT: HIT . Philippe Coutinho, Inter Milan, £8.5m . What a snip £8.5m looks after the Brazilian, still only 22, has become one of the league’s best players. VERDICT: HIT . Coutinho and Daniel Sturridge, both signed in January 2013, must be considered 'hits' for Liverpool . Summer 2013 . Luis Alberto, Sevilla, £6.8m . The 22-year-old is currently on loan at Malaga after failing to break into Liverpool’s first team and is yet to start a league match for them. VERDICT: MISS . Iago Aspas, Celta Vigo, £7.2m . Strikers are judged on their goals and Aspas, now on loan at Sevilla, has scored only one of those for Liverpool in an FA Cup match. VERDICT: MISS . Simon Mignolet, Sunderland, £9m . Been through some shaky spells but when on form, which he is at the moment, he is one of the Premier League’s best goalkeepers. VERDICT: HIT . Simon Mignolet has endured some shaky spells at Liverpool, but when in form, he is one of the league's best . Joao Teixeira, Sporting Lisbon, £800,000 . The 22-year-old has performed well on loan at Brighton this season and time will tell if he can break into Liverpool’s first team, but he has to be deemed a ‘miss' after only one substitute appearance so far. VERDICT: MISS . Kolo Toure, Man City, free . At 34, he is no longer one of the greatest centre-backs in the league but is by no means one of the worst and signing him on a free transfer was a shrewd piece of business. VERDICT: HIT . Mamadou Sakho cost Liverpool £18m and has failed to justify his price tag, while Kolo Toure joined on a free . Mamadou Sakho, Paris Saint-Germain, £18m . Can be a formidable central defender at times but is far too erratic to justify the £18m price tag. VERDICT: MISS . Tiago Ilori, Sporting Lisbon, £7m . Yet to play for Liverpool and the defender has managed only a few appearances on loan at Granada and now Bordeaux. Only 22, but is running out of time to prove himself. VERDICT: MISS . Summer 2014 . Kevin Stewart, Tottenham, free . Another who could well become a ‘hit’ in the future, but cannot be considered one right now with the 21-year-old not appearing for Liverpool. On loan at Burton. VERDICT: MISS . Rickie Lambert, Southampton, £4m . It felt like he was joining the club as a back-up player, but injury to Sturridge and lack of form from Mario Balotelli thrust Lambert into the spotlight and he has been unable to deliver. VERDICT: MISS . Rickie Lambert, replacing Raheem Sterling in Liverpool's win over Newcastle, is a bit-part player at Anfield . Adam Lallana, Southampton, £25m . Lallana has admitted he is yet to repay the Liverpool fans for his hefty price tag and has been well short of his commanding displays for Southampton in recent seasons. VERDICT: MISS . Emre Can, Bayer Leverkusen, £10m . Rodgers appears to be moulding Can into a centre-back  and at 21 he has played with a mature head that belies his tender years. VERDICT: HIT . Lazar Markovic, Benfica, £20m . The Serbian has been at times brilliant but has failed to produce that form on a regular basis and at £20m fans will be expecting far more. VERDICT: MISS . Emre Can has played with a mature head that belies his tender years since joining from Bayer Leverkusen . LIVERPOOL . TOTAL MONEY SPENT: £215.7m . TROPHIES WON: 0 . CHELSEA .

TROPHIES WON: FA Cup, Community Shield . Dejan Lovren, Southampton, £20m . Another former Southampton player who turned in a number of consummate displays on the south coast but has failed to replicate them in Merseyside. Become an error-prone player since his move. VERDICT: MISS . Divock Origi, Lille, £10m . The Belgian is only considered a ‘miss’ due to not playing for Liverpool, but if he can replicate his form on loan at Lille when he returns, Rodgers could have a frightening forward at his disposal. Still only 20. VERDICT: MISS . Alberto Moreno, Sevilla, £12m . Been an ever-present at full-back in Liverpool’s side this season; strong, fast and direct going forward and is not bad at defending as well. VERDICT: HIT . Mario Balotelli, AC Milan, £16m . His off-field problems outweigh his one goal in the league and three in other competitions. The controversial Italian has mustered all season. Rodgers needed a stellar name to replace Luis Suarez up front and Balotelli has not been that. VERDICT: MISS . HITS: 7 . MISSES: 15 .","Liverpool will go another campaign without silverware after FA Cup exit .

"Millions of Britons could lose credit card perks such as cash bonuses and air miles because of EU legislation. Capital One yesterday became the first provider to scrap its cashback offer for new customers because of restrictions that will squeeze profits. The company has also warned existing customers that the loyalty points they earn will be much lower from June 1. Financial experts believe other firms are likely to follow suit. Capital One yesterday became the first provider to scrap its cashback offer for new customers after the announcement of an EU cap limiting the fees retailers can be charged for processing payments (file photo) The company scrapped the deal after the announcement last month of an EU cap – due to be introduced in October – limiting the fees retailers can be charged for processing payments. Capital One said it made perks 'no longer sustainable'. Kevin Mountford, of price comparison website MoneySupermarket, told the Daily Telegraph: 'This is a classic case of regulators, in this case European, trying to act with the consumer in mind, only for the policy to come back to bite the very people it was supposed to help. 'Its new rules won't just hit cashback cards, all loyalty programmes are at risk because something will have to give when card companies are squeezed.' Last month, the European Parliament voted in favour of a cap at 0.2 per cent of the transaction value for debit cards and 0.3 per cent for credit cards. The cap will apply to all purchases paid for with a card in the EU – either abroad or on the internet. Several credit card companies – including American Express, Barclaycard, and Santander – have millions of customers who earn hundreds of pounds or free flights if they clear their debts every month.

It said it would not be increasing fees or charges as a result of the changes. Rachel Springall, of financial information website Moneyfacts, said: 'The changes from Capital One could be the starting point for a change to reward schemes because of the new ruling on interchange fees. 'Instead of adding on card fees, providers will be looking at other ways to re-coup their costs and one of the ways to do this is to withdraw reward schemes or interest-free offers. All it takes is for one provider to start the ball rolling before others do the same.'","Capital One became the first provider to scrap cashback for new customers .

"From the sky it appears to be an idyllic island with amazing beaches and a dense forest, but tourists or fishermen don’t dare to set foot on this outcrop in the Indian Ocean due to its inhabitants’ fearsome reputation. Visitors who venture onto or too close to North Sentinel Island risk being attacked by members of a mysterious tribe who have rejected modern civilisation and prefer to have zero contact with the outside world. When they do interact with outsiders, it usually involves violence – the indigenous Sentinelese tribe killed two men who were fishing illegally in 2006 and have been known to fire arrows and fling rocks at low-flying planes or helicopters on reconnaissance missions. Scroll down for video . Sentinelese tribespeople, holding javelins, gather on the shore of North Sentinel Island, located in the Bay of Bengal . Following the 2004 tsunami this member of the Sentinelese tribe was photographed firing an arrow at an Indian Coast Guard helicopter . This satellite image taken by NASA shows the untouched North Sentinel Island, which is about the size of Manhattan . Located in the Bay of Bengal, North Sentinel Island belongs to India and remains an enigma, despite being populated for an estimated 60,000 years. Untouched by modern civilisation, very little is known about the Sentinelese people, their language, their rituals and the island they call home. It is too dangerous to approach them due to their hostility to outsiders, meaning they are rarely photographed up close and almost never seen on video. Most of the photos and video clips that do exist are of poor quality. There are also conflicting reports on the tribe’s population, with most estimates putting it in the range of a few dozen to a few hundred. It’s still unclear what impact the 2004 tsunami had on the population and the island, which is part of India’s chain of Andaman Islands, although the uncontacted tribe managed to avoid being wiped out. After the tsunami one member was photographed attempting to fire an arrow at an Indian Coast Guard helicopter. The tribespeople are rarely photographed or recorded on video; the only existing images or video clips tend to be of poor quality . To protect the Sentinelese people - and visitors - the Indian government has established a three-mile exclusion zone . Often referred to as a ‘Stone Age tribe’ – a title that advocates take offence to, as its members have adapted over time – the Sentinelese may be the most isolated tribe in the world, with the Indian government choosing not to meddle in their affairs. The government made several failed attempts to establish contact, but has abandoned all attempts and allows the tribe to live how it chooses on an island that is about the size of Manhattan. Indian authorities have gone as far as making it a crime to try to make contact with the Sentinelese. It is illegal to go within three miles of the island. While privileged people are eating £15 burgers and splashing £100 on new trainers, the near-naked Sentinelese are surviving off the land and hunting for sea creatures. But the waters surrounding the island appear to be under threat by even more illegal fishermen. Survival International said the islanders are ‘extremely healthy, alert and thriving’, but their fishing waters are being threatened . This aerial image shows the dense tree canopy on the island, which has remained untouched by modern civilisation for centuries . Survival International reported late last year that it had received reports that fishermen are targeting the area, with seven men being apprehended by the Indian Coast Guard. One of the fishermen reportedly stepped foot on the island in close proximity to the tribe’s members, and he managed to leave unscathed. Survival International, which advocates for tribal peoples’ rights, describes the Sentinelese as ‘the most vulnerable society on the planet’ as they are likely to have no immunity to common diseases such as flu and measles. Due to their complete isolation, the chances of them being wiped out by an epidemic are very high, according to the organisation. This aerial image from Google Maps shows a shipwreck off the coast; clashes with salvagers have left several tribespeople dead . In a statement, Survival International’s director, Stephen Corry, said: ‘The Great Andamanese tribes of India’s Andaman Islands were decimated by disease when the British colonised the islands in the 1800s. ‘The most recent to be pushed into extinction was the Bo tribe, whose last member died only four years ago. The only way the Andamanese authorities can prevent the annihilation of another tribe is to ensure North Sentinel Island is protected from outsiders.’ The organisation said the islanders are ‘extremely healthy, alert and thriving’, despite threats from the outside world and their 'old world' way of life. Their hostility towards outsiders can at least be partially attributed to past conflicts. Survival International said 'the outside world has brought them little but violence and contempt'. In the late 1980s and early 1990s several tribespeople were killed in battles with armed salvagers who visited the island to recover iron and other goods from a shipwreck.","The indigenous tribe has lived on North Sentinel Island in the Indian Ocean for an estimated 60,000 years .

"A Chicago single mother has revealed what it's really like to live on McDonald's wages, where she makes only $10.50 an hour and can only afford to sleep in a moldy basement. Adriana Alvarez, 22, says that even with assistance from food stamps, Medicaid, and a child care subsidy, she is barely getting by, despite having worked for McDonald's for five years. Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. She said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees of the fast food chain began to protest. Scroll down for video . Single mother Adriana Alvarez, 22, has revealed what it's really like to live on McDonald's wages, where she makes only $10.50 an hour and can only afford to sleep in a moldy basement in Chicago . Alvarez (pictured with her three-year-old son Manny) says that even with assistance from food stamps, Medicaid, and a child care subsidy, she is barely getting by, despite having word for McDonald's for five years . The mother revealed in a column for Refinery29 that the first thing she would do with an increased wage would be to find a 'decent place to live' with good schools for her three-year-old son Manny. 'When it rains, water steeps into the apartment,' Alvarez writes of her basement home, the only place she said she can afford. 'This wetness brings mold, and I can't get rid of the smell. We can’t even leave anything on the floor... toys or anything else on the floor may get ruined when the water comes in.' Alvarez said that, after paying for 'child care, transportation to work, food, rent, and our other basic expenses,' she can never afford to give anything else to her son. 'Every time I think about taking Manny somewhere fun, like to a movie, I have to think about whether we can really afford the gas,' she writes. The mother said even providing the specific milk her son, who drinks 'a half-gallon every two days', requires because of his lactose intolerance can be a struggle. Since it's a more expensive brand, it uses up most of the $80 Alvarez is allotted in food stamps, she told the New York Times. Alvarez said her situation is not unique. She said that most of her co-workers are 'in the same boat', forced to rely on government assistance 'no matter how long they've held their jobs'. According to one study cited in Business Insider, half of the nation's fast food workers require some kind of government assistance, costing taxpayers $7billion a year. Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. She said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees began protesting . Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand the $15 an hour wage . And $1.2billion of that public assistance goes to employees of McDonald's annually, reported a study released by the National Employment Law Project. Just weeks ago, McDonald's announced that it would be giving a $1 pay raise for about 90,000 employees, effectively making their wage $10 an hour. But the raise only applies to employees who work in restaurants owned by the corporation. Restaurants operated by independent franchise workers were ineligible for the wage bump, which Alvarez said disqualifies nine out of 10 McDonald's employees. And, even for those who do get an increased wage, Alvarez argues that the number would 'hardly going to lift any working family out of poverty'. And higher wages aren't all Alvarez and her co-workers are fighting for. She said Fight For $15 is also protesting for the ability to form a union 'without interference from management'. A group of protesters in New York stage a die-in as part of a day of rallies and protests by fast-food workers known as 'Fight for $15 on April 15' Fight For $15 (pictured protesting on Wednesday) started two years ago in New York, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving . Alvarez writes that she needs a union to help negotiate sick days, which she said she is currently not provided with, costing her a day's worth of wages when she has to stay home if her son is ill. Fight For $15 started two years ago in New York City, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving. The movement staged rallies across the country yesterday in honor of 'Fight for $15 on April 15'. Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand a wage raise. There has been some change. Seattle and San Francisco have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and a ballot campaign began in Washington, D.C. this week to initiate the same change. But Alvarez hope she will get to see change in her own life soon. 'It doesn't seem right that people who work with children or who serve food aren't paid enough to support their own kids or put food on their own table,' she writes. 'We want our families to be able to look forward to a better future.' There has been some change.

"A young choirmaster at an exclusive private school took a vulnerable student's virginity just months after she confided in him that she had been abused by another music teacher, a court heard. Edward Moore was working in his first job as assistant director of music at King Edward's School in Witley, Surrey, when he had consensual sex with the 16-year-old student in his office. After the incident, the 24-year-old said to her: 'Oh my God, you have to forgive me, you will hate me one day.' Moore, from Ascot, Berkshire, was jailed for nine months on Friday after admitting two counts of abusing a position of trust and sexual activity with a girl aged 13 to 17 years. A choirmaster at King Edward's School (above) in Witley, Surrey, took a vulnerable student's virginity just months after she confided in him that she had been abused by another music teacher, a court heard . He had only been working for a few months when he began to grow close to the student. The girl came to him in November 2012 to reveal she had been touched inappropriately by another music teacher when she was aged just 13. Moore, who was the girl’s choirmaster, had only been at the school for a few months. Gary Ponds, prosecuting at Guildford Crown Court, told how Moore had taken on a counselling role for the traumatised young girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. He said: 'Their relationship over time developed until it was past the point of a proper teaching relationship.' While Moore did not teach the girl he was in position of authority as her choirmaster. After rumours began circulating at the £29,000-a-year school, which Sally Bercow previously attended, the headmaster warned Moore not to spend any more time alone with the pupil or let her into his office. But their friendship blossomed into a sexual relationship over the summer of 2013. They sometimes spent Friday nights together and secretly travelled to Westminster Abbey and the Isle of Wight on trips. Mr Ponds said that on one Friday Moore asked if the student wanted have sexual intercourse. Gary Ponds, prosecuting at Guildford Crown Court (above), told how Edward Moore, 24, had taken on a counselling role for the traumatised young girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons . He continued: 'She agrees and that is what happened. She made it clear that she was a virgin at the time. 'It was abundantly clear throughout that this was an emotionally fragile girl.' There was no further sexual activity and Moore, who did not use a condom, cut communication with the pupil. She later rang Childline because she was feeling suicidal and confessed about the tryst to a school chaplain, who was obliged to tell the school. Judge Peter Moss said the impact of Moore's offending had forced the schoolgirl to move to another school and left her with 'long term implications on her education and her future dreams'. He described her as a 'bright and ambitious girl'. He added: 'Her emotions have been in a high degree of mess because of your actions. 'You knew of her vulnerabilities, that is how you came to be in the proximity. Taking her on trips amounts to a grooming of her. 'It appears by this stage she was starry-eyed and in love with you and you expressed the same to her. The £29,000-a-year school was previously attended by Sally Bercow, pictured (above) in 2014 . 'The following week you took her virginity without a condom. These are all aggravating features. 'You stole her innocence.' Moore, dressed in a white shirt and blue tie, wiped his eyes as details of his victim's trauma were read to the court. Rina-Marie Hill, defending, said Moore had struggled to cope with the pressure of hearing the details of the student's previous abuse in his first term of work, having no experience of teaching or any training. She said: 'He wasn't allocated the complainant to look after, she came to him and for a significant time their relationship was a proper student-teacher relationship. 'The activity ceased because of Mr Moore's actions - he realised he had gone too far and he distanced himself from the complainant.' The choirmaster described the two instances of sexual activity over two weeks as a 'horrific mistake' that he would 'pay for for the rest of his life,' the court heard. Ms Hill added: 'He will never teach again and he will have this conviction on his record for the rest of his life.' Judge Moss told the court he found it 'impossible' to avoid imposing an immediate custodial sentence, despite Moore's early admission of guilt and previous 'exemplary' character. Sentencing he said: 'It is abundantly clear that you have much to offer and that this is out of character. 'But the message must be understood by those in positions of trust, however young. 'You were 23, an intelligent man who knew what you were dealing with. You knew that she had immature, young and fragile emotions and there can be no mercy for someone who abuses that.' Moore will also be put on the Sex Offenders Register and will be barred from working with children.

"A previously unknown seasonal change on the sun is occurring every two years, according to a new study. Researchers have found that twisted bands of magnetic fuel reach the surface of the sun every two years - in addition to its existing 11-year cycle. And when the seasons combine, the activity of the sun can be amplified, producing mega storms that are even more dangerous to Earth than others. Scientists in Colorado have found evidence for a new solar season cycle. Every two years it appears 'bands' of magnetic field move to the surface. This combines with the existing 11-year solar cycle, causing even more powerful coronal mass ejections (CMEs), pictured, and solar flares that can endanger Earth . The study was carried out by a team of researchers led by the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Colorado. They found that the changes seem to be driven by bands of strong magnetic fields in the sun's hemispheres which emanate from the solar interior. It was already known that the sun goes through a solar cycle of 11 years, during which its activity increases and decreases. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth's magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. But this shorter two-year season seems to also play a part in the sun's activity, on a similar scale to the 11-year cycle - despite being much quicker. The new solar season occurs when twisted, ring-shaped 'bands' of magnetic field rise from the solar interior and pass to the surface through the tachocline - a 'transition' region in the outer third of the sun. 'Much like Earth's jet stream, whose warps and waves have had severe impact on our regional weather patterns in the past couple of winters, the bands on the sun have very slow-moving waves that can expand and warp it too,' said co-author Dr Robert Leamon, a scientist at Montana State University. 'Sometimes this results in magnetic fields leaking from one band to the other. 'In other cases, the warp drags magnetic fields from deep in the solar interior, near the tachocline, and pushes them toward the surface.' The result of this motion is that the bands create turbulent regions of activity on the surface, causing solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). CMEs are the huge waves of material that are seen in images of the sun, and they can pose a threat to satellites in Earth orbit. Solar flares are flashes of energy on the surface of the sun, which are sometimes associated with CMEs - although their connection is not well understood. The new solar season discovery occurs when twisted, ring-shaped 'bands' of magnetic field rise from the solar interior and pass to the surface through the tachocline - a 'transition' region in the outer third of the sun. Shown in this illustration are the various different regions of the sun and a sunspot (top right) The bands, which appear in each hemisphere of the sun, cause the 11-year solar cycle to actually become a longer cycle that lasts 22 years. The 11-year solar cycle sees a periodic change in the sun’s activity - such as the number of ejections - in addition to changes in the number of sunspots, flares and other visible differences. A solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released. Radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves at the long wavelength end, through optical emission to X-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end. The amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100-megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time . A flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots. Their frequency varies from several a day, when the sun is particularly active, to less than one a week during quiet periods. However, the cause of the 11-year cycle is poorly understood. And according to this new research, when the 11-year cycle combines with the two-year cycle, the solar storms that pummel Earth's atmosphere can be amplified. The bands  appear to take place separately in the northern and southern hemispheres, with activity peaking over 11 months, then dropping over another 11 months. The almost annual variations can be likened to regions on Earth that have two seasons, such as a rainy season and a dry season. 'What we're looking at here is a massive driver of solar storms,' said Dr Scott McIntosh, lead author of the new study and director of NCAR's High Altitude Observatory. 'By better understanding how these activity bands form in the sun and cause seasonal instabilities, there's the potential to greatly improve forecasts of space weather events.' The overlapping bands are fueled by the rotation of the sun's deep interior, according to observations by the research team. The study, published this week in Nature Communications, could help lead to better predictions of massive geomagnetic storms in Earth's outer atmosphere that sometimes disrupt satellite operations, communications, power grids and other technologies. The research was funded by Nasa and the National Science Foundation, which is NCAR's sponsor. The 11-year solar cycle sees a periodic change in the sun’s activity - such as the number of ejections - in addition to changes in the number of sunspots, flares and other visible differences. Shown here are images of the sun over one cycle showing changes in its activity . The surges of magnetic fuel from the Sun's interior catastrophically destabilise the corona, the sun's outermost atmosphere. They are the driving force behind the most destructive solar storms. 'These surges or ""whomps"" as we have dubbed them, are responsible for over 95 per cent of the large flares and CMEs - the ones that are really devastating,' Dr McIntosh said. The almost-annual variability can also help explain a cold-war era puzzle: why do powerful solar flares and CMEs often peak a year or more after the maximum number of sunspots? This lag is known as the Gnevyshev Gap, after the Soviet scientist who first reported it in the 1940s. The answer appears to be that seasonal changes may cause an upswing in solar disturbances long after the peak in the solar cycle. Researchers can turn to advanced computer simulations and more detailed observations to learn more about the profound influence of the bands on solar activity. Dr McIntosh said this could be assisted by a proposed network of satellites observing the sun, much as the global networks of satellites around Earth have helped advance terrestrial weather models since the 1960s. 'If you understand what the patterns of solar activity are telling you, you'll know whether we're in the stormy phase or the quiet phase in each hemisphere,' Dr McIntosh said. 'If we can combine these pieces of information, forecast skill goes through the roof.'","Scientists in Colorado have found evidence for a new solar season cycle .

"Women with advanced cervical cancer – the most common cancer afflicting young women – are to get the first officially approved new treatment for a decade. Trials show Avastin, which is used in several other cancers, gives women around four months’ extra life. The drug plus chemotherapy has now been licensed by European regulators. Patients will have access via the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) until it is considered for routine NHS use. It has been available in England via the CDF since last March pending licensing. Scroll down for video . Drug: Trials show Avastin, which is used in several other cancers, gives women about four months’ extra life . Each year an estimated 600 women with advanced cervical cancer could benefit from Avastin, costing £3,370 for a month’s treatment. The drug’s use was accelerated by the US Food and Drug Administration which approved Avastin plus chemotherapy for advanced cervical cancer in August 2014. Nearly 3,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer in the UK each year, and it kills around 1,000 women. Cervical cancer, which is cancer of the neck of the womb, is the most common cancer in women aged 35 and under. It is treated with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy and if diagnosed and treated early the outlook is good. However, for patients who are diagnosed when their cancer is at a more advanced stage it becomes more difficult to treat and a cure is unlikely. Reality TV star Jade Goody died in March 2009 aged 27 after a very public battle with the disease. The time between her diagnosis and death was just months, suggesting her cancer was already at an advanced stage on diagnosis and within five months it had spread.

Dr Mary McCormack, Consultant Clinical Oncologist at University College Hospital, said ‘Cervical cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in younger women. ‘For those women with metastatic disease (that has spread) or whose cancer recurs after surgery/chemoradiation there are very few treatment options. It is very welcome indeed that when Avastin is added to chemotherapy it prolongs survival by approximately four months. ‘For a young mother sitting in front of you with small children, or indeed any patient with cancer, that length of time can be extremely important.’ Robert Music, chief executive of Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, said ‘This regulatory decision for Avastin is positive news. To date, prognosis for women who receive a late-stage diagnosis of cervical cancer has often been poor. ‘Any additional time that can be provided through new drugs with limited impact on quality of life is extremely valuable to patients and their families.’ Trial findings show Avastin combined with chemotherapy can extend the lives of women with advanced cervical cancer by 26 per cent compared with chemotherapy alone. The drug, made by Switzerland-based drug makers Roche, led to overall survival of 17 months compared to 13 months. Avastin works by blocking the blood supply to the tumour, starving it of oxygen and nutrients. An independent blood supply is critical for a tumour to grow beyond 2mm and spread to other parts of the body.11 . Tumours develop their own blood supply in a process called angiogenesis by releasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) – a key driver for tumour growth. Avastin is an antibody that precisely targets and inhibits VEGF.","Drug plus chemotherapy has now been licensed by European regulators .

"Doctors at a scandal-hit hospital covered up a series of horrendous mistakes that led to the death of a twin baby boy, a coroner has ruled. Thor Dalhaug died an hour after birth following a difficult delivery during which he suffered fatal brain damage due to a doctor’s errors, ruled Stuart Fisher, senior coroner for Central Lincolnshire. In a damning report, he said an unsupervised junior surgeon tried to deliver the baby using forceps in an ‘unorthodox and unacceptable’ way. The coroner also concluded that senior managers at Lincoln County Hospital had tried to remove the fact that forceps had been used from an account of the birth. Doctors at the Lincoln County Hospital covered up a series of horrendous mistakes that led to the death of a twin baby boy (pictured above with his mother Michelle), a coroner has ruled . The report will come as a blow to the hospital, which has just been taken out of ‘special measures’. United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust was put on a turnaround regime almost two years ago because of concerns over high death rates. It is meant to have made a host of improvements. But Thor’s parents said the report revealed that staff had behaved ‘appallingly’ over their son’s death in September 2013. Rolf and Michelle Dalhaug were delighted when they found out they were expecting twins after seven years of trying for a baby. She was taken for a caesarean as doctors found Thor was distressed. But after the baby’s head became stuck, junior surgeon Dr Deniz Al-Hirmizy tried to free him with her hands, before resorting to forceps. The baby was born alive but limp. Doctors resuscitated him but he died an hour later. Mr Fisher ruled that Thor died of brain damage as a result of attempts to free the baby’s head. He also wrote that the ‘use of forceps in these circumstances was unorthodox and unacceptable’. While Dr Al-Hirmizy stated she had ‘experience of caesareans’, she claimed she had been ‘unsupervised’, wrote Mr Fisher. Surgeons ‘neglected to make a full note of the circumstances’, he found. ‘In particular’, he wrote, a doctor ‘was advised to amend the caesarean pro forma, to include the fact that forceps were used’. But this doctor was ‘dissuaded from doing so by senior management as a result of concerns as to how this would be perceived’. Mr Fisher ruled that Thor died of brain damage as a result of attempts to free the baby’s head during delivery at the hospital (above) Mr Dalhaug, 39, said: ‘The Trust have acted appallingly, causing our family great hardship. We accept that accidents can, do and will happen. What we do not accept is their failure to be honest, their failure to learn and their failure to act.’ Dr Suneil Kapadia, the Trust’s medical director, apologised to the Dalhaug family and said it would pay them compensation. He went on to say that the Care Quality Commission had recently rated the hospital’s maternity services as good. But Suzanne White, a partner at law firm Leigh Day, said the family was looking at bringing a private prosecution. She added: ‘Despite representing families at inquests for over 15 years, I am astonished by the circumstances surrounding baby Thor’s tragic death.’","Thor Dalhaug died at Lincoln County Hospital in September 2013 .

"Dina Amos-Larkin (above), 21, has been left paralysed from the neck down after falling 50ft from a hotel balcony in Salou, Spain . A British gymnast has been left paralysed from the neck down after falling 50ft from a hotel balcony. Dina Amos-Larkin was attending a four-day sports festival in Salou, Spain when she fell while talking to her mother on the phone on April 3. The 21-year-old law student, who represents Great Britain at trampolining, was in a medically-induced coma for two weeks and was told of her injuries when she was brought round a week ago. She told Simon Wright of the Sunday Mirror that authorities initially said the fall, from a fourth floor balcony at Hotel Jaime 1, was a suicide bid. 'That isn't the case - I spent the day doing sport and went drinking in the evening, but wasn't drunk,' she said. 'The balcony rail was lower than my waist and I think I just leaned back too far.' The student, from Poole, Dorset, claimed she is now stranded in hospital as she is waiting for her insurer AXA to review her case. A GoFundMe page has since been set up to raise £20,000 to get Miss Amos-Larkin, who is also captain of the Angels cheerleading squad at Surrey University, home. More than £13,900 has already been donated. The page reads: 'Dina Larkin suffered horrendous injuries including paralysis when she fell from a balcony during a student festival in Barcelona. 'Dina is an international gymnast and aspiring law student. But most of all she is a daughter, a sister and a friend to many. 'Her recovery has been halted because the costs of getting her back to the UK amount to over £10,000. And then there's the adaptive care she will need when she is home.' Her mother Audrey, 48, and father Stephen, 49, told the Sunday Mirror their 'hearts are broken'. The street the hotel is on (above) has lots of high-rise apartments with white rails lining each balcony . A GoFundMe page has since been set up to raise £20,000 to get Miss Amos-Larkin (above), who is also captain of the Angels cheerleading squad at Surrey University, home . 'We just want her home,' they added. Her last Tweet was a week before the incident, when she posted a photo of the cheerleading squad after the Team Surrey varsity and wrote: 'These kids know the score! @Surreyangels brought it home.' She added a picture of the sea on Instagram five days later and wrote: 'Enjoying that ocean spray. Let's hope it can cure this hangover #TOUR #spain #sunshine #ocean #saloufest #coastline #teamsurreytour2015.' A spokesman for AXA said: 'We are looking into the circumstances and until those investigations have been completed, it would not be appropriate to comment further.

"The grandson of a notorious New York mobster has become the mayor of a sleepy village. Philip Gigante, 41, whose grandfather Vincent 'The Chin' Gigante was the head of the Genovese crime family, was elected into the positions by residents of Airmont, which has a population of around 9,000. The Republican real-estate lawyer, who will get $25,000 a year for the part time job, hopes his 'achievements and accomplishments' are what constituents notice, and not his heritage. Crime family ties: Philip Gigante, 41, whose grandfather Vincent 'The Chin' Gigante was the head of the Genovese crime family, was elected into the positions by residents of Airmont, New York . He told the New York Post: 'People are free to believe what they wish.' But people living in the area who know his background disagree. One person who wished to remain anonymous said: 'It’s frightening for not just me but all village residents aware of his background.' Vincent Gigante, who had nicknames such as 'The Oddfather' and 'The Robe', started out as a boxer but then rose in the ranks and became in Genovese-family captain in the 1960s and '70s. In 1981 he became head of the family, and in 1992 became one the most influential gangsters in the United States - following the death of members of the Gambino family including their leader John Gotti. However Vincent was forced to step down because of poor health. He maintained a distinctive appearance, wearing a bathrobe and slippers around the streets of New York in a bid to look insane, so he could avoid prosecution - a scheme he later admitted to. 'The Oddfather' Vincent maintained a distinctive appearance, wearing a bathrobe and slippers around the streets of New York in a bid to look insane, so he could avoid prosecution - a scheme he later admitted to . He was indicted on federal racketeering charges in 1990, but was deemed unfit to stand trial. But in 1997 he was finally convicted and given a 12-year sentence. He died in a Missouri federal prison at the age of 77. An article in the Rockland County Times, published before the election, they said it was the area's 'worst kept secret'. The candidate's background may have been an easy route into negative campaigning from his opponents, but they both avoided it and paid tribute to Gigante's character. Thomas Gulla, 54, said: 'He has the interests of the village at heart. Whatever his grandfather did for a living is not a reflection on him.' Gigante also runs a freight business set up by his father Salvatore, The Chin's son, but insists it is legitimate and has no financial links to the crime gang. He told the Post: 'Their hard work and years of sacrifice has made it what it is today. I am saddened that people will try and trivialize their efforts and associate our business with anything but lawful and ethical beginnings.'

"It is not the first advertising billboard in which a company has used the image of a svelte, bikini-clad model to sell its wares and it probably won’t be the last. But something about this poster for Protein World diet supplements has struck a collective raw nerve. The company is facing a massive backlash over its billboard campaign — including vandalised posters, a petition, a protest rally and even a bomb threat. Scroll down for video . Protein World's billboard campaign advertising diet supplements features a svelte bikini-clad model asking 'Are you beach body ready?' Campaigners launched a scathing attack on the protein supplement company after the advert — which features a toned model posing with the slogan ‘Are you beach body ready?’ — began appearing on the London Underground three weeks ago. The ‘body shaming’ campaign has seen many of its posters defaced with feminist slogans, more than 50,000 people sign a petition to have them removed and a demonstration planned for this weekend in protest. But yesterday the company’s marketing boss claimed the firm is ‘just trying to make the nation healthier’. Richard Staveley, Protein World’s head of global marketing, added: ‘It’s been a brilliant campaign for us and I don’t see us changing anything dramatically any time soon.’ Richard Staveley, Protein World’s head of global marketing revealed that the company has received bomb threats in the wake of the campaign but said it had been 'brilliant' and that he didn't see the company changing . On ITV’s Good Morning Britain yesterday, presenter Susanna Reid, 44, admitted that, like many women, she finds the advert ‘a little bit anxiety-inducing' On ITV’s Good Morning Britain yesterday, presenter Susanna Reid, 44, admitted that, like many women, she finds the advert ‘a little bit anxiety-inducing’. And the Advertising Standards Authority confirmed it had received 277 complaints, with many commenting that ‘the advert is offensive, irresponsible and harmful because it promotes an unhealthy body image’. Posters have been vandalised with feminist messages such as ‘Your body is not a commodity’. Photographs of the amended signs have gone viral online. Despite the controversy, earlier in the week the company announced on Twitter it had made sales of £1 million and attracted 20,000 new customers in just four days following the advert’s release. Protein World has taken a strong stance on social media during the furore and has posted blunt replies to complaints on Twitter, including ‘why make your insecurities our problem’ and ‘grow up’. The company’s CEO and founder, Arjun Seth, has even branded the people defacing his adverts ‘terrorists’, ‘irrational and extremist’. But the poster has struck a collective raw nerve with many of the billboards being vandalised with people writing messages reinforcing that every 'body' of any shape, size and age is ready for the beach -  such as #eachbodysready . Pictured of the defaced posters have appeared on Facebook, such as this which someone had covered with a note which reads: '1 You're body is fine just as it is. 2 Whatever it looks like your body is not a commodity #Everybody's ready #Everyday sexism' Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Mr Staveley said his company had received a series of threats, including one to bomb its head office. He said: ‘First, we’ve been inundated, as you’ve probably seen from our Twitter feed and Facebook, of people defacing adverts, ripping them down and climbing over rail tracks to graffiti them. ‘That’s criminal behaviour. I think that’s quite extreme behaviour. ‘We’ve actually had threats on our head office, physical, violent threats. We had a bomb threat.’ More than 52,300 people have signed a petition demanding the adverts are removed. Demonstrators plan to congregate at London’s Hyde Park on Saturday for a protest dubbed ‘Taking back the beach’. On a Facebook page calling on people to attend the demonstration, a post reads: ‘The idea that your body should be hidden away if it doesn’t meet these bizarrely specific requirements . . . I’m over it.’ The company is facing a massive backlash over its billboard campaign — including vandalised posters, a petition, a protest rally and even a bomb threat . More than 50,000 people have already signed a petition to have them removed and a demonstration planned for this weekend in protest . When Miss Reid asked Mr Staveley about claims the posters make women feel anxious, he replied: ‘We’re advertising our weight-loss collection. That’s what millions of people are aspiring to do in time for their summer holiday — to lose a bit of weight, feel a bit healthier and get fitter. It’s not a new concept.’ He confirmed the model in the picture, Australian Renee Somerfield, 23, had achieved her enviable physique using Protein World products, and denied the image had been retouched or altered. A spokesman for Transport for London said the adverts will be taken down from today — not because of the controversy, but because they have ‘come to the end of their natural three-week advertising lifespan’. Sioned Quirke, a specialist dietitian based in South Wales, said: ‘Some people do find that increasing their protein intake can aid weight loss. ‘But generally, taking a supplement or diet pill will not do all the work for you. ‘Also, these kinds of products are not regulated or monitored, so you can never be 100 per cent sure what is actually in them.’ Online fitness store Protein World, who claim that the image is entirely unPhotoshopped, have been actively engaging in the furore on social media, strongly defending their campaign with some biting responses to aggrieved Tweeters .","Protein World's billboard features a svelte bikini-clad model asking 'Are you beach body ready?'

"A father has been left furious after police ran over his daughter’s cat – and then simply told the family that their pet had been ‘disposed of’. Harry the ginger tom was hit by a police car near Tony Hunt’s home. But instead of tracking down the owner and explaining what had happened, the officers involved knocked on a neighbour’s door and asked for a black bin bag. A witness then described seeing them ‘scooping Harry up and placing him in the bag in the boot of the car’. Tony Hunt, from Normanton in Derby, is demanding an apology from police after a neighbour reported his daughter's cat Harry had been hit by a patrol car and 'disposed of' Mr Hunt spent two days putting up ‘lost cat’ posters in his area before finding out what had happened from a local teenager. Incredibly, when he contacted police, officers coldly told him Harry had been ‘disposed of’. Yesterday Mr Hunt, from Normanton, Derby, broke down as he described how a neighbour had witnessed the police car running over his cat. The incident is now being investigated by Derbyshire Police’s Professional Standards Department, he said. Mr Hunt, 42, said he had told five-year-old daughter Lily that her beloved pet had gone to heaven, but could not bring himself to tell her why. He accused police of a ‘lack of humanity’ and demanded a face-to-face apology from the two officers involved – one of whom was a WPC. Mr Hunt is outraged as the three-year-old ginger cat (pictured) was micro-chipped so officers could easily have contacted the family . The restaurant manager, who lives with partner Zoe Price, 30, their daughter Lily and one-year-old son Thomas, said: ‘What has happened is absolutely disgusting. ‘I couldn’t believe what I was hearing when a young lad called to tell me he had seen the police run over Harry. ‘I called 101 straight away and eventually spoke to a desk sergeant, who confirmed Harry had been hit and said he’d been “disposed of”. ‘There was no compassion whatsoever. He didn’t go into details as to how Harry had been “disposed of” and I didn’t want to know, to be honest. For all I know, they could have tossed him straight in the bin.’ Mr Hunt was informed about the three-year-old cat’s demise by Ali Nisar, who lives a street away. The 16-year-old saw the car coming ‘at speed’ down the road with its blue lights flashing last Sunday. Mr Hunt'sfamily have been devastated by what happened, saying a 'huge chunk' of their lives is now missing . He said: ‘The cat was in the middle of the road but the car went straight over it. They didn’t seem to brake, but I don’t know how they could not have seen it.’ Mr Nisar added: ‘Two days later I saw Tony’s poster and recognised the picture of the cat. I rang him to tell him that the police had killed his cat. I was gobsmacked that they hadn’t already informed him.’ Mr Hunt said Harry was microchipped and his body could have been returned to the family for cremation if the police had taken him to a vet or the RSPCA to be scanned. He added: ‘If it hadn’t been for my neighbour witnessing what happened, we’d still be searching for him now.’ A spokesman for Derbyshire Police said it was ‘aware of the allegations’, adding: ‘We’re in the process of trying to identify the officers who are allegedly involved to get their account of what happened.’","Tony Hunt, from Normanton in Derby, is demanding an apology from police .

"At least one is dead after a powerful storm capsized several sailboats participating in a regatta, and crews searched late on Saturday for at least four people missing in the waters, the Coast Guard said. The storm rolled through the area about 4 p.m. and a man was plucked from the waters by the Coast Guard around 9 p.m., Petty officer Carlos Vega said. He said crews would search through the night. 'We knew we were totally lost at sea,' said regatta participant Rhonda Morgan Gilreath, right, shown with her boyfriend Randy Rutledge of Rome Georgia on Saturday . Dauphin Island Regatta sailors gather near their docked sailboats on Saturday, April 25, 2015, in Dauphin Island, Alabama where Coast Guard officials said they responded to a report of multiple capsized vessels . More than 100 sailboats and as many as 200 people were participating in the Dauphin Island regatta in Mobile Bay. Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier told Al.com  that at least one person was confirmed dead, but he did not know the cause. 'It's been a very tragic day,' Michael Smith, with the Buccaneer yacht club, told WSFA-TV. 'We've had a lot of breakage, missing people, fatalities.' Susan Kangal, who was on a boat, told WSFA it was the worst storm that she has seen. 'We were probably an inch from capsizing; everybody was ready to jump. I didn't have a life jacket on,' she said. The boats were part of the 57th iteration of the race. Scattered boats: 'They were scattered anywhere from Dauphin Island Bridge all the way out into Mobile Bay and across to Fort Morgan. It was a wide area,' said Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier . Feeling blessed: Well-wishers congratulate regatta participant Robert Luiten of Mobile, Alabama, in blue shirt, on word that his son, Leonard Luiten, was found several hours after their boat capsized in a storm on Saturday .

'They were scattered anywhere from Dauphin Island Bridge all the way out into Mobile Bay and across to Fort Morgan. It was a wide area,' said Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier. AL.com reports that Richard Mather, 52, of Mobile, was aboard a 39-foot O'Day sailboat along with seven people, when he saw two boats collide. He said that they expected thunderstorms but not as severe as they were. 'But we were not prepared for a gale,' Mather said, 'which is almost like a 30-minute hurricane.' Mather wasn't in the race and was able to pull three people onto his vessel about two miles north of the Dauphin Island Bridge. He said the boaters seemed extremely tired but none of them were injured. 'They were exhausted but they were fine,' he said. 'Their boats sunk so fast that they didn't have time to grab life preservers.'","A powerful storm capsized several sailboats participating in a regatta, and crews searched for at least four people missing in the waters .

"Gibraltar could be the new home of Britain's nuclear submarines if the SNP succeeds in ridding Scotland of Trident. Moving the nation's nuclear deterrent to the British territory  could cost £3billion and take 10 years to complete, it was reported. The SNP want to eject Trident from Scotland, but both the Conservatives and Labour have committed to retaining the base on the Clyde. Scroll down for video . Gibraltar could be the new home of Britain's nuclear submarines (one pictured) if the SNP succeeds in ridding Scotland of Trident . A senior military source told the Sunday Express that Ministry of Defence officials have sounded out Gibraltar as an alternative to the naval base on the Clyde. 'A party was sent to Gibraltar in January to determine whether the option could work. One can only assume it’s part of broader ­contingency planning,' the source said. The SNP's deputy leader Stewart Hosie has threatened to hold Westminster to ransom over Trident if the party holds the balance of power after the general election on May 7. Other options for a new home for the nuclear deterrent include Falmouth, but the potential political fall-out of moving the submarines to the Cornish coast make Gibraltar a more attractive proposal. Dr Nick Ritchie, international security lecturer at the University of York, said any move could anger Spain - who already dispute Britain's claim over Gibraltar . Moving the nation's nuclear deterrent to Gibraltar (pictured) could cost £3billion and take 10 years to complete, it was reported . He said: 'If the MoD is exploring other options, it shows admirable planning and foresight. Choosing Gibraltar would avoid the nimbyism question. Any alter­native site in England or Wales would carry political down sides. But Gibraltar has enough patriotism to overcome this. 'It would be interesting to see Spain’s reaction, ­however, since it is a non-nuclear member of Nato.' Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo said it had the facilities available and had been visited by submarines from the UK and the US in the past. However, a spokesman for the MoD said: 'This is absolutely untrue and we can be very clear that the MOD is not planning to move the nuclear deterrent from HM Naval Base Clyde to Gibraltar, or anywhere else. 'The MOD is fully committed to retaining the deterrent on the Clyde and indeed we are basing all our submarines there from 2020.” The likelihood of any move is likely to be increased by a strong performance by the SNP in the election. The SNP want to eject Trident (submarine pictured) from Scotland, but both the Conservatives and Labour have committed to retaining the base on the Clyde . Ed Miliband has ruled out a formal coalition with Nicola Sturgeon's party, as well as a confidence-and-supply agreement which would see the SNP back Labour on crucial votes, such as the Budget or the Queen's Speech. He told Andrew Marr today: 'No coalition, no tie-ins, I have said no deals - I have been clear about that. I am not doing deals with the Scottish Nationalist Party.' The Conservatives have made the prospect of a Labour administration that's reliant on SNP votes one of the central planks of their election campaign in the last fortnight. Last week a Labour frontbencher expressed regret that the party cannot ‘get rid’ of Trident. Shadow Welsh secretary Owen Smith said at a hustings event on Wednesday: ‘We view the world as being a very dangerous and volatile place at the moment. So our policy is that we will retain Trident, we will maintain a continuous at-sea deterrent.’ But he added: ‘So we will pursue an independent perspective, the next Labour government, but on the issue of Trident: would but we could get rid of it but I fear that we can’t.’","Trident nuclear deterrent could be moved to Gibraltar, according to reports .

"The Duchess of Cambridge is already up to four days overdue with her second child - and her labour could now be induced this week, it was claimed today. The 33-year-old royal’s baby is expected before the end of April - with the due date initially reported as yesterday, but later claimed to actually be as early as Wednesday last week. Either way Kate - who plans to give birth at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London - is now overdue and may have already spoken to doctors about the possibility of being induced. Scroll down for video . Previous royal birth: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leave the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London, in a proud moment with their newborn  son Prince George in July 2013 . Due date: Preparations have been made outside the Lindo Wing of the hospital (pictured yesterday) for the huge crowds expected to welcome the royal birth - with the Duchess said to be up to four days overdue . A source, whose children were born at the hospital’s exclusive Lindo Wing, told Daily Telegraph reporter Gordon Rayner: ‘The doctors don’t normally wait for more than a week. ‘They will probably already have been in touch with Kate, and talked about which day which suit her best to go in and be induced if the baby doesn’t arrive in the next couple of days.’ A Kensington Palace source said last week: 'We haven't ever confirmed a due date.'  Prince George was reportedly born three days late when he arrived at the hospital in July 2013. The joint favourite dates for the royal baby to be born are tomorrow and Tuesday at 6/1 - with Wednesday priced at 7/1 and Thursday 8/1, according to MailOnline's official betting partner Coral.

But some punters might look further ahead for their bets - if they believe those who say labour is influenced by the lunar cycle and the arrival of a full moon. The next full moon is on May 4. The idea is the moon's gravitational pull affects the amniotic fluid in the same way it affects water in the sea and rivers. When Kate gave birth  on July 22, 2013, it was the day of a new full moon. Meanwhile Prime Minister David Cameron has defended William and Kate for opting to use private health services rather than the NHS. Asked if he was disappointed the Royal Family did not use the NHS, Mr Cameron told Sky News today: ‘I think it's a total matter of choice for people - what they use and where they have their babies. All I hope and pray for is there'll be happy, healthy news for that wonderful couple and for the whole country.’ Around one in five deliveries in the UK is assisted. A Danish study in February suggested inducing women at 37 weeks can lower the chance of a baby dying or developing a serious health condition.","Due date believed to have been between last Wednesday and yesterday .

And anyone really desperate can always stop off at the Costa Express in between. The latest Costa will open on the site of the former Dedworth Road HSBC branch, the last bank in the area before it closed last year amid protests. Less than 500 yards away is a Costa which replaced a cycle shop earlier this year. It means there will be two Costas just a brisk five-minute walk apart, plus the Costa Express at a petrol station between them. One resident, Samantha Taylor, wrote online: 'I think it's mad and I wish our local councils could see that we are drowning in fast food and coffee shops in Windsor.' However, Matt Gordon-Smith said: 'The important point here is that this is in Dedworth which formerly wouldn't have had such businesses coming here. 'Surely places like Costa coming in rather than another fast-food shop or betting shop - there will soon be three within a mile - is that a sign that this part of Windsor is on the up?' Costa's planning application says the new shop would be a 'significant driver to local trade'. Planners said there was no legal reason to refuse. Costa were unavailable for comment. It means there will be two Costas just a brisk five-minute walk apart, plus the Costa Express at a petrol station between them (file picture)","Town planners have allowed two Costa cafes less than 500 yards apart .

"Moors murderer Ian Brady has revealed he is a Ukip supporter and thinks David Dimbleby is an 'establishment dumpling'. The 77-year-old wrote the letters from his bed at Ashworth psychiatric hospital in Merseyside. Brady was jailed for life in 1966 after torturing and killing five children with his then-girlfriend Myra Hindley. Scroll down for video . Moors murderer Ian Brady, pictured (left) from Ashworth psychiatric hospital and (right) in a court sketch in 2013, has revealed that he is a Ukip supporter and thinks David Dimbleby is an 'establishment dumpling' in a series of letters . In a series of rambling letters, he wrote: . It comes four months after Brady - who has to use a Zimmer frame to move around - wrote a letter to a Channel 5 News correspondent, in which he expressed no remorse for his killings. Instead he complained he is 'bedridden and worsening' after breaking his hip and arm in fall a year ago. Brady (left) was jailed for life in 1966 after torturing and killing five children with his then-girlfriend Myra Hindley (right) The victims were lured to their deaths, sexually tortured then buried on Saddleworth Moor above Manchester. Above, police search the area for the bodies . In the December letter he wrote: 'This cell block is described as a ""discharge ward""; I've been sitting here 30 years... and there's no turnaround of inmates unless in a coffin.' Brady murdered five children between 1963 and 1965 along with accomplice Hindley, who died aged 60 in 2002. The victims were lured to their deaths, sexually tortured then buried on Saddleworth Moor above Manchester. Pauline Reade, 16, disappeared on her way to a disco on July 12, 1963, and John Kilbride, 12, was snatched in November the same year. Keith Bennett was taken on June 16, 1964, after he left home to visit his grandmother. Lesley Ann Downey, 10, was lured away from a funfair on Boxing Day, 1964, and Edward Evans, 17, was killed in October 1965. His letter reads: . Politicians of today? Compared to the only truly democratic and altruistic peoples’ government ever elected, Labour 1945, the UK corrupt, greedmotivated (sic) political vermin of today, aren’t worth even assassination, all being Tory clerks/lackeys. However, I hope that UKIP not only wipes out the Lib-Dems but also decimates the Tory and Labour vote, and that the SNP achieves the same in Scotland. In addition, I hope the IRA is reactivated, as promised for a united Ireland. [...] . The corporate controlled (including the BBC) lower middle class, collusive, servile media generate a false appearance if of democracy and free speech, in a now spineless population constantly asking, ""am I allowed to say (this and that)?""

Incidentally, the Scottish dictionary definition of ""Cleg"" (sic) is, aptly, ""a course grey bloodsucking horsefly"".

As I stopped reading UK newspapers or relying on UK media, depending only on Aljezeers (sic) and Teletext, I know nothing of any EU decisions on UK prisoners possibly voting, and couldn’t care less!

Brady was given whole life sentences for the murders of John, Lesley Ann and Edward - but did not admit to killing Keith and Pauline until he was in prison. Keith's body has never been discovered. Hindley was convicted of killing Lesley Ann and Edward, and shielding Brady after John's murder. She was jailed for life. Taxpayers have forked out more than £14million on Brady since he was convicted nearly 50 years ago. He has racked up the costs by staging a 15-year hunger strike and a series of failed legal challenges - for which he has relied on legal aid.

"This is the moment when al-Qaeda linked Islamist fighters enter a town in Syria, narrated by a British jihadist fighter. The video, which shows a convoy of jihadist insurgents triumphantly celebrating their capturing of the northwestern Syrian town of Jisr al-Shughour emerged yesterday, shortly after their victory. Just hours after the eight-minute video was filmed, Syrian government warplanes carried out more than a dozen air strikes on Jisr al-Shughour, killing some 20 fighters. Scroll down for video . Victory laps: Two Islamist fighters on a motorbike hold a black jihadist flag often associated with Islamic State, as other fighters hug and cheer in the street of Jisr al-Shughour . The city in the northwestern Idlib province was captured by a terrorist alliance that includes al-Qaeda affiliates Al-Nusra, who released the video, and other groups of Islamist militants. The video was released yesterday, and is believed to be filmed by a young man who has travelled from the UK to join the fight in Syria. The man speaks with a British accent as he narrates the video from a car driving into the city. 'This is all new territory, by the mujaheddin, this is all new territory, liberated by the muslimeen,' he says from behind the camera. 'This region has been freed and the oppression has been lifted,' whilst repeatedly calling out Allahu Akhbar [God is great]' Behind the frontline: The eight-minute video appears to be narrated by a British fighter and shows the al-Qaeda linked group's entry into the Syrian city they have captured . Jisr al-Shughour, a city in the northwestern Idlib province, was captured by a terrorist alliance, comprising al-Qaeda affiliates Al-Nusra, who released the video, and other groups of Islamist militants . Despite the man behind the camera claiming that the Islamist have 'liberated' the city, the inhabitants of Jisr al-Shughour can be seen fleeing on foot and in whatever vehicles available . The man preaches as a 'saviour' claiming the al-Nusra front has 'saved these oppressed people', despite filming the inhabitants of the city as they pack their belongings and flee in long convoys on foot and in cars. The man, whose face is not shown in the video, claims that the locals are fleeing their homes because of the Syrian government, and that al-Nusra has come to 'free' them. The day after the town was captured by the Islamist alliance, which did not include fighters from Islamic State, the Syrian government responded in force, a monitoring group said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 20 air strikes hit the city, which had been one of the regime's last remaining strongholds in Idlib province. There was no immediate word on any casualties from the latest raids, but the Observatory said the death toll from several dozen air strikes on the city on Saturday had risen to 27. 'At least two civilians and 20 fighters were killed in the Saturday air strikes along with five others whose identities are not yet known,' Observatory director Rami Abdulrahman said. 'The toll is expected to rise after the bombing continued overnight and into Sunday.' Fighting between rebel forces and regime troops continued south of the city on Sunday, he added, and opposition fighters had captured at least 40 government forces. 'Ten members of the (pro-regime) National Defence Force were captured yesterday by fighters, and today a group of 30 soldiers were found hiding in a building near the southern entrance of the city,' Mr Abdulrahman said. 'The army launched a failed raid to rescue them.' Calm before the storm: Just hours after the video was filmed, Syrian government warplanes carried out more than a dozen air strikes on Jisr al-Shughour, killing some 20 fighters . Attacks: Smoke rises from opposition-controlled Jobar district of Damascus after a Syrian army fighter jet attacked in a separate airstrike earlier Sunday . Syrian state television said the military had ambushed some militants close to Jisr al-Shughour, which was captured on Saturday for the first time in the four-year conflict by a hardline Islamist alliance including al-Qaeda. Syrian television also reported that the insurgents had slaughtered civilians, but the Observatory said only government supporters had been detained and no one killed. 'Terrorist groups committed a horrific massacre of civilians after entering Jisr al-Shughour,' state television quoted a military source as saying. It said at least 30 civilians had been killed in the town close to the Turkish border. But Observatory said combatants had detained government backers and that there was no confirmation so far they had killed anyone. 'If we knew people were killed by them we would report it,' Mr Abdulrahman added. 'No women and children were captured.' The capture of the town of 50,000 people in Idlib province was the latest setback for government forces in the south and north of Syria. Insurgents have been trying to push the army out of the few remaining government areas in the province, bringing them closer to Latakia, a coastal province of vital importance to President Bashar al-Assad. State news agency SANA also said the military had carried out night raids around Jisr al-Shughour and inflicted heavy losses on its enemies. Last month the hardline Sunni Islamist rebels seized Idlib city, the provincial capital, after forming an alliance that includes Al-Nusra, the Ahrar al-Sham movement and Jund al-Aqsa, but not the rival ISIS group which controls large tracts of Syria and Iraq. The Islamist alliance calls itself the Army of Fatah, a reference to the conquests that spread Islam across the Middle East from the 7th century.","Video narrated by British jihadist fighter emerge from Syrian frontline .

"A lone Iraq veteran set up camp outside a shamed fraternity, which is reeling from allegations that its members drunkenly taunted wounded soldiers, spat on servicemen urinated on the U.S. flag. Perry Clawson, a former Army colonel, was pictured Friday sitting outside the University of Florida's Zeta Beta Tau frat house in Gainesville, waving a Stars and Stripes of his own. Clawson, who said the members had 'p*****d off' servicemen across the country with their actions, pitched up outside the building, proudly displayed the flag which accompanied him on two tours of duty to Iraq. Shall not be moved: Perry Clawson, a retired Army colonel, pitched up outside the Zeta Beta Tau frat house in protest of their alleged treatment of wounded veterans . Disrespected: Nicholas Connole, pictured, said that braying students spat on him and his service dog as he tried to enjoy a vacation with his wife . Service: Connole is picutred above during on of his tours of duty in the Middle East . 'Disgusting': Linda Cope, who founded the retreat to honor her wounded son, said she saw frat members urinating on the U.S. flag . He was one of many veterans to respond to unedifying allegations that Zeta Beta Tau members had abused soldiers attending the Warrior Beach vacation retreat in Panama City Beach, the Gainesville Sun reported. The charity event provides vacations for maimed soldiers, their carers and families - but ran afoul of braying frat boys holding an event of their own earlier this month. One veteran, wounded Nicholas Connole, said frat members spat on him and his service dog from their balconies. He told local TV station WJHG: 'They actually spat on me and my service dog as well, and that's just so disrespectful and it hurts.' Haley Riley, whose husband is another injured veteran, said students hurled beer bottles at attendees. Linda Cope, who founded the retreat after her son lost both his legs in an IED explosion, said that rowdy students even went so far as to urinated on the American flag. Suspension: The Zeta Beta Tau chapter at the University of FLorida has been suspended, and three of its members expelled. There is nothing to suggest anybody in the photograph above was involved . Zeta Beta Tau's University of Florida chapter was suspended in the wake of the allegations, which university authorities are investigating. They have charged the organization with 'causing physical or other harm, obscene behavior, public intoxication, theft and property damage'. The fraternity has expelled three members and is also holding its own investigation. The expelled frat members have not been named. It has yet to determine what exactly took place, but said in a statement that 'there is no doubt that some our members engaged in unacceptable behavior.' While Panama City Beach police were called to deal with the frat members, they ultimately let the resort management handle them, and did not file any charges or write a police report. Zeta Beta Tau's University of Florida chapter was already on probation after being found guilty of holding hazing rituals at the start of this academic year. It was already restricted to a limited events program - and will face even tougher penalties than usual if the university decides to take action. Another Zeta Beta Tau chapter, belonging to Emory University in Georgia, was also caught up in the allegations, but has denied that any of its students were involved.","Retired Col.

"Former FBI Director Louis Freeh nearly died last summer when he was involved in a car crash driving near his summer home in Barnard, Vermont. Current FBI director James Comey and Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy spoke about the accident for the first time last week, during an appearance at Chaplain College. They say 64-year-old Freeh severed an artery in one of his legs and would have bled to death in just 60 seconds if it weren't for the quick response from paramedics and an FBI agent on the scene. Scroll down for video . Near-death experience: New information has been revealed about the devastating car crash former FBI Director Louis Freeh (pictured above) was involved in last summer in Vermont . 'Louis would have died within a minute or so. They stopped the bleeding,' Leahy said, according to the Burlington Free Press. 'He credits those folks with saving his life,' Comey added. While Freeh told police that he has no memory of the crash, it's believed that he fell asleep behind the wheel while going about 60 to 65 mph on Vermont 12 on August 25, 2014. Freeh lost control of his vehicle and crossed into oncoming traffic before driving off the road and into a tree. He nearly ran into three other drivers on the road, who were luckily able to swerve out of the way before crashing head-on with Freeh. It's believed that Freeh fell asleep behind the wheel before the August 25, 2014 crash. No one else was injured. Above, a scene from the wreck . Eight months later, Freeh is still recovering from the crash and walking with the aid of a cane. Above, another view of the crash scene . After the crash, Freeh was airlifted to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire and was eventually transferred to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington. Eight months later, Leahy says Freeh is recovering well and recently stopped by his office for a visit. 'He walks with a cane. Most people wish they could move that well,' the senator said. 'His recovery has been remarkable.' Freeh was the director for the FBI from 1993 until 2003. He released a statement after Comey and Leahy's statements, saying: 'May God bless all of these individuals who are so instrumental in my recovery.'","Officials spoke about the devastating single-vehicle crash in August for the first time last week .

"Simon Wood, 38, from Oldham won Masterchef last Friday . Wannabe chefs with their eye on a career as the next Gordon Ramsay or Jamie Oliver should take note - it doesn't have to cost a fortune. The new winner of Masterchef Simon Wood, who won the title last Friday, hasn't been on a single cookery course or even had one lesson. Everything the 38 year old knows about cooking is self-taught - learnt form reading recipe books or watching television shows. He told MailOnline: 'It’s all self-taught. There’s no more to it than that. You can achieve anything if you try hard enough and you’re passionate enough. 'I learnt what I know from reading, websites like YouTube, watching TV and talking to people who are also passionate about it. 'I also found out a lot from watching chefs when I go to a restaurant - you go into a lot of restaurants these days and you can see straight into the kitchen. 'I can’t help it, it’s like watching TV and if it’s happening in front of you, you can’t help but watch what they do.' While Simon, who lives in Oldham,  learns about his cooking from reading and watching programmes, he sharpens his skills by practicing on his four children - Liam, 20, Alex, 18, Cameron, 16, and Charlotte, seven. The lucky children are often on the receiving end of their father's culinary masterpieces - in the Wood household lunchboxes can become works of art. He said: 'They only get fancy stuff in their lunch boxes when I’m practising. 'All of my kids like different things, so it can be like a gourmet buffet sometimes when you’re at my house. 'Everyone wants something different, someone wants fish, and someone else wants shellfish - if it’s in the fridge or freezer it’s likely to come out at some point or another. 'They’re not fussy at all though. They’re like me, there’s nothing I don’t like and that has carried on through to them too. It makes life a lot easier.' Scroll down for video . Simon has always wanted to be a chef - when he was eight, he won the opportunity to spend a day in a hotel kitchen and featured in the local newspaper. But he gave up his dream because he and his wife, who he separated from two years ago, had a child very young. The couple met while working at McDonalds and when he was just 19, they had their first child - Liam. Simon as an eight year old after winning the chance to spend a day in a hotel kitchen . The hours that chefs do are notoriously antisocial and so Simon decided to take up a career in IT instead. His children are over the moon that their father is now following his dream though and they watched the Masterchef final on TV together last Friday, when they learnt for the first time that their father had won - because it had to be kept a secret until the programme aired. He said: 'When we watched it together, it was the first time that they found out I had won and it was emotional, it was pretty overwhelming. 'It was a moment in all of our lives that we’ll remember and will treasure and look back on.' Simon has come a long way since the beginning of the show - in the first episode he was so terrified that Greg Wallace, who is one of the judges on the show, pointed out that he was actually 'shaking in his trainers'. Simon said: ' When you first go in there on day one, when you see John and Greg for the first time, they’re practically idols of yours and you’ve not met them before that. 'Then it all starts to get very real very quickly. It’s a daunting prospect that’s in front of you. 'So the next hour and 15 minutes that you get in there can determine the rest of your life really.' But Simon managed to overcome his nerves and was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show. He won the final with a starter of octopus, with chorizo crisps and a cannellini bean and chorizo salad; his main course was pigeon with carrots, pommes parisienne and a cassis jus; and for the pudding he produced a lemon posset, with citrus tutti-frutti. Simon was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show . He said: 'You grow so quickly when you’re down there. You get feedback from people that you’d never normally meet and they’re so good at what they do - everyone down there is. 'I got loads of really good feedback down there. I had a really good competition when I found my confidence and got rid of my nerves – I think it showed as well.' For anyone looking to follow Simon's success, he has one simple tip - enjoy it. He said: 'If you don’t enjoy it, it shows in the food that you haven’t made something you believe in or enjoyed making. That comes out on the plate and ultimately for your guests or whoever is eating the meal and that’s no good because food is about passion and giving people a valuable experience. 'If you don’t enjoy it I don’t think your guests will either.' Simon hasn't always been this good, even Masterchef winner's have the occasional cooking disaster. As a young man, he learnt the hazards of absent-minded cooking after he tipped and entire stock he had worked on for hours down the sink. He said: 'My biggest disaster was when I was younger and first started out cooking, I did Christmas dinner for the first time. 'I had a big turkey carcass so thought I was going to make a really nice stock. 'I simmered it for hours and hours and made a really good stock. 'Then I went to drain all of the vegetables and the bones out and ended up pouring it all down the sink because I didn’t put something under it, that was a lesson I learnt really early on – think about what you’re doing. 'I don’t think there is anything I can’t cook though. I think I’ve shown throughout the competition that I’m good with most things that get thrown at me.' Simon is now hoping to open a restaurant of his own . While he enjoys fancy cooking, one of the simplest culinary pleasures for Simon is a meal that can be rustled up in under ten minutes - a plain omelette. He said: 'The first thing I ever cooked as a child was an omelette. 'And if I'm looking for something quick and easy to do, I still always go back to an omelette and a glass of wine, with a salad. 'Nothing in it, just some sea salt and a really good salad with it, that’s it – done. 'Just nice and simple, good eggs, good omelette.' But anyone looking to sample some of the cooking that netted Simon the Masterchef prize can expect something much more intricate when he succeeds in his dream of opening his own restaurant. For the time being he is going back to the IT company he worked for, but his eye is already on setting up his own eaterie. He said: 'I am definitely planning on having a restaurant eventually – it’s every cook or chef’s dream. 'If you can make money doing something you love and enjoy it and help people create memories then that is amazing. 'I think a lot of people remember where they were when they had a good meal with special people at special times - if you can get involved with that by having a restaurant, it’s really good. 'I think I’d want to do classic dishes with a modern twist. 'Something that looks nice, is achievable. But is also quite opulent and refined and nice. 'Also something that isn’t out of everybody’s reach.'","Simon Wood, 38, from Oldham won Masterchef last Friday .

"Doctors are being told to ask all patients over 75 if they will agree to a 'do not resuscitate' order. New NHS guidelines urge GPs to draw up end-of-life plans for over-75s, as well as younger patients suffering from cancer, dementia, heart disease or serious lung conditions. They are also being told to ask whether the patient wants doctors to try to resuscitate them if their health suddenly deteriorates. New NHS guidelines urge GPs to draw up end-of-life plans for over-75s and say it will improve their care . The NHS says the guidance will improve patients' end-of-life care, but medical professionals say it is 'blatantly wrong' and will frighten the elderly into thinking they are being 'written off'. In some surgeries, nurses are cold-calling patients over 75 or with long-term conditions and asking them over the phone if they have 'thought about resuscitation'. Other patients have spoken of the shock of going in for a routine check-up and being asked about resuscitation. The extraordinary new guidance has been brought in despite the outcry over the use of 'do not resuscitate' orders under the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP). The discredited pathway was scrapped last year after the Mail revealed that doctors were placing 'DNR' notices on patients without their knowledge and depriving them of food and fluids. The guidelines – which also recommend patients should be asked if they want to die at home – have been drawn up by experts advising NHS England, the organisation which runs the health service. Patients have spoken of the shock of going in for a routine check-up and being asked about resuscitation . One expert last night said the guidance was 'the thin end of the wedge of assisted suicide'. Professor Patrick Pullicino, who spearheaded the campaign against the LCP, said: 'What is most blatantly wrong is trying to get someone to agree to a 'do not resuscitate' order before they are even sick. For somebody who is perfectly well, or has got a mild or not a serious illness, that would be totally out of place.' Roy Lilley, a health policy analyst and former NHS trust chairman, said: 'It will give some older people the impression that no-one wants to bother with them. It looks as though they're being told: 'You're old, how do you want to die because you're in the way'. 'It's a very clunky thing to do – it's completely unnecessary.' Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said: 'There will be some people who will be put out, disconcerted and think they are not going to get the best available care. They might think this is a way of saving money for the NHS. Other patients will be prepared to talk about it and think it sensible.' A 'do not resuscitate' order is meant to stop a patient suffering unnecessarily where their lives are likely to be extended for only a short period of time. Resuscitation can be traumatic and cause broken ribs or damage to organs, including the spleen. Doctors estimate that only 10 to 15 per cent of patients are brought back to life and some suffer permanent brain damage. But asking patients to make such a decision when they may have many years to live will prompt concerns that the NHS is writing them off. A 'do not resuscitate' order is meant to stop a patient suffering unnecessarily where their lives are likely to be extended for only a short period of time . In some parts of England, practice nurses have been instructed to cold-call patients and fill out an advance care plan for them over the phone. Ruth Nicholls, a palliative care nurse in the South East, told how her brother-in-law, who has a heart condition, was contacted immediately after he had a hospital appointment. In an interview with Nursing Times, she said: 'He came back from an outpatient appointment having not had very good news and later that afternoon got a phone call from one of the practice nurses at his GP surgery. 'She said: 'Hello, we're ringing all our patients with chronic conditions to see how you are and whether you have thought about resuscitation.' 'This conversation was absolutely out of nowhere. My brother-in-law was shocked and my sister was distraught.' She also said an elderly patient was asked about resuscitation by a district nurse he had never met during a routine visit. 'One of the first questions he was asked was whether he wanted to be resuscitated,' she said. 'People are being left in great distress.' The controversial Liverpool Care Pathway was phased out last year following harrowing reports that patients were being left so dehydrated they were left to suck on wet sponges given by relatives because nurses had banned water. The Liverpool Care Pathway was meant to be phased out last year following concerns that it was being abused by NHS staff. But recently, nurses have warned that it is still being used by hospitals under a different name. The LCP is a practice whereby foods and fluids are withdrawn from patients who are thought to be close to death – and they are usually sedated. Patients are usually also given a 'do not resuscitate' order, instructing doctors not to attempt to restart their hearts should they suffer a cardiac arrest. But it was meant to be banned last summer following a campaign by the Mail highlighting how the practice was being used by hospitals to free up bed space or claim controversial financial incentives. Relatives told of how they gave dehydrated patients water in secret, or wet sponges for them to suck on. An inquiry in 2013 overseen by Baroness Julia Neuberger ordered the practice to be phased out by hospitals by the summer of 2014 – and said no patients should ever be denied food or fluid. But earlier this year nurses and cancer charities told MPs on the health select committee that the pathway was still being used by hospitals – although not by that name. One nurse warned that the 'abuse' suffered by patients under the LCP may still be happening in the NHS, a prospect she described as 'horrifically worrying'.","New NHS guidelines urge GPs to draw up end-of-life plans for over 75s .

"Ed Miliband will do 'more damage to the country than he did to his brother', Boris Johnson said this morning as the pair clashed on live TV. The London Mayor, who appeared alongside Mr Miliband on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, launched a furious personal assault on his rival - with their encounter descending into a furious shouting match. But Mr Miliband, who beat his elder brother David to the Labour leadership in 2010, ended up laughing off the attack, responding: 'Come on Boris, you're better than that.' Animated: Boris Johnson wags a finger at Miliband, who appears to have a clenched fist, on the Andrew Marr Show this morning. The rivals' encounter quickly descended into a slanging match . No let-up: The Tory and Labour politicians go at it hammer and tongs in front of their TV audience . The heated exchange ends with presenter Andrew Marr (right) injecting and the men trying to laugh about it . Mr Johnson's verbal mauling of the Labour leader comes after the Tories were accused of 'descending into the gutter' for claiming that Mr Miliband may 'stab the country in the back' by doing a deal with the SNP to get into power. But today, Mr Johnson insisted that Labour could not take power without the support of the SNP, and claimed the prospect was 'actually deeply alarming'. He said Mr Miliband would have to take help from the Scottish party 'crouching on his back like a monkey' - making it impossible for him to govern in the interests of the whole UK. The London Mayor added: I am not saying that your brother had to present himself at A&E with a dagger in his back... [but] he [Ed Miliband] would do more damage to this country than he did to his brother, and that is the key point.' Verbal onslaught: Mr Johnson said that Labour could not take power without the support of the SNP . Time to go: Mr Johnson and Mr Miliband leave the politics programme after their massive on-air argument . Mr Miliband arrived at the BBC studios in Central London by car, while Mr Johnson cycled there . Ed Miliband won the Labour leadership in September 2010 by narrowly beating his brother David, who had been the runaway favourite for the top job. The younger sibling won the ballot by just over 1 per cent after the second, third and fourth preference votes came into play. David had garnered the majority of support from Labour MPs and party members - but Ed was ahead with the trade-union members. He hugged David after the result was announced - but later admitted the decision to stand against him caused deep division between the brothers. David stayed on as an MP until 2013, then announced he was quitting Parliament to become head of the giant New York-based charity International Rescue Committee. Mr Miliband hit out at the Conservatives for their campaign, saying: 'They are so desperate they are reduced to trying to set one part of the country against another.' Mr Johnson insisted the Conservative attacks on the SNP were not risking the union. 'I'm so proud and so positive about what's happening in this country at the moment, and I just think there are unnecessary risks involved in this Labour-SNP condominium,' he said. 'So the answer would be, no I don't think we are in any way imperiling the union. The people who would imperil the union, because that's what their party is called, is the Scottish Nationalist Party. 'And I imagine their strategy - like the parable, or the fable, of the frog and the scorpion - is to be allowed to be carried across the river and then ultimately to sting... [he is cut off]' The Conservatives have made the prospect of a Labour administration that's reliant on SNP votes one of the central planks of their election campaign in the last fortnight. But Mr Miliband has repeatedly insisted that he will not make any 'deals' with the SNP to become Prime Minister. And he told Andrew Marr today: 'No coalition, no tie-ins, I have said no deals - I have been clear about that. I am not doing deals with the Scottish Nationalist Party.' Asked explicitly whether he was ruling out a confidence-and-supply agreement, he replied: 'No deals.' Ed Miliband and Boris Johnson livened up the election campaign this morning when they went head-to-head on live TV. After being interviewed separately by presenter Andrew Marr, the pair of would-be Prime Ministers were brought together to challenge each other directly. Mr Miliband kicked off the heated exchange by demanding to know if Mr Johnson backed rules that allow wealthy foreigners living in Britain to avoid tax on their overseas earnings. He said: ‘Are you for keeping non-dom status? You’re defending those people who come here, they live here for 30 years, they are permanently here and they don’t pay taxes here.’ Mr Johnson responded: ‘Hang on, is this the Ed Miliband who was in the Treasury with Gordon Brown for about ten years? Are you the same creature? I mean, is there some sort of doppelganger going on?’ The Labour leader hit back, saying: ‘Don’t get rattled, come on now. Andrew Marr interjected to ask the London Mayor to defend inflammatory remarks in which he had accused Mr Miliband of being a back stabber. He said: ‘You attacked Ed Miliband very forcibly today, Boris, for backstabbing. Do you really think that is a fair approach to somebody who is standing in an election? Before Mr Johnson could speak, Mr Miliband said: ‘He doesn’t believe it. Come on, Boris, you are better than that.’ But the London Mayor replied: ‘I am not saying that your brother had to present himself at A&E with a dagger in his back. But he would do more damage to this country than to his brother - and that is the key point.’","London Mayor appeared with Mr Miliband on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show .

"A young mother has spoken of her humiliation after a dental assistant apparently removed her nine-month-old son from her arms without asking while she was breastfeeding him in the dentist's chair. Tayler Chaice Buzbee was forced to make an emergency appointment at an Aspen Dental facility in Alabama on Friday morning after developing agonizing toothache which would not go away. But after calling the dentist's office, she was informed that the only available appointment was in just 20 minutes - meaning that she had no time to find a babysitter for her infant son, Attley. Instead, Tayler was assured by employees that she could bring her baby to the facility. The pair turned up shortly after - but midway through the appointment, Attley started to create a fuss. Upset: Tayler Chaice Buzbee has spoken of her humiliation after a dental assistant apparently removed her baby son, Attley (pictured with Tayler) from her arms while she was breastfeeding him in the dentist's chair . 'I don't nurse in public, and I never have because I hear these stories about people being shamed... I don't do well with being confronted, so I usually find another room to go to,' Tayler toldAL.com. But she said that, in this instance, she had no option but to breastfeed Attley - a gorgeous dark-haired baby with big brown eyes and a cheeky grin - because he was hungry and causing a scene. The hygienists apparently did not mind Tayler nursing her son - and one even offered to halt the treatment and return when she was finished. But Tayler declined and continued to be treated. A short while later, the dentist and another female employee came into the room. The latter reportedly told Tayler that she was not permitted to breastfeed her baby in the dentist's office. Then, while the dentist examined Tayler's teeth, the employee removed Attley from her arms - without permission and before he had finished feeding from his mom - because he was 'in the way'. She then placed him in a stroller, it is reported. Tayler, who was shocked, left the office soon after. Controversy: While the dentist examined Tayler's teeth, a female employee removed Attley from her arms - without permission and before he had finished feeding from his mom - because he was 'in the way' Facility: Tayler had made the emergency appointment at the Aspen Dental facility (file picture) in Alabama on Friday after developing agonizing toothache. She was left 'humiliated' after the breastfeeding incident . Speaking to the news site, the Marshalls employee said: 'I have never felt so humiliated in my life.' She added: 'That was my biggest concern. Don't take him out of my arms. It was a situation where I was humiliated, I was crying, and I felt just embarrassed to be there.' In a statement, Aspen Dental Management Inc apologized to Tayler. 'No nursing mother should ever be made to feel uncomfortable while feeding her child,' representative Kasey Pickett told AL.com. She added that the company is investigating the incident. It is not the first time a new mother has been 'shamed' for breastfeeding in public. Mother and son: Despite the female employee's actions, the dental hygienists apparently did not mind Tayler (back) nursing her son (front) - and one even offered to halt the treatment and return when she was finished . 'Shamed': It is not the first time a new mother like Tayler (pictured, left, with Attley) has been 'shamed' for breasfeeding in public. In January, 24-year-old mother Alanna Panas claimed she was kicked out of a casino in Berlin, Maryland, for breastfeeding her seven-week-old daughter (right, with Alanna) in the lobby . In January, 24-year-old mother Alanna Panas claimed she was kicked out of a casino in Berlin, Maryland, for breastfeeding her seven-week-old daughter in the lobby. Alanna, a mother-of-one from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, said she was thrown out by security at the Casino at Ocean Down after they told her she and daughter Lilly were a 'security risk'. She said she had intended to feed her daughter in her car but did not have time to get the keys and as it was a cold, rainy evening, the casino lobby was her only choice,USA Today reported. Last year, an international study found mothers are made to feel 'ashamed' when they breastfeed in public - while many are put off breastfeeding by negative comments from health workers. Mothers reported being stared at or tutted at and felt as if they were seen as 'hippies' or 'weirdos'. Others said they wanted to breastfeed after 12 months but feared public disapproval. Negative emotions are also common for new mothers who are trying to breastfeed in hospital soon after giving birth. These are due to staff actions and comments, the research found. Dr Gill Thomson, of the Maternal and Infant Nutrition and Nurture Unit at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, led the study, which also involved researchers in Germany and Sweden.","Mother-of-one Tayler Chaice Buzbee called Aspen Dental with toothache .

"Hundreds of children were admitted to hospital last year after being born brain damaged following exposure to alcohol in the womb, alarming new figures have revealed. In total, 272 youngsters left disabled by Foetal Alcohol Syndrome were hospitalised in England over the past 12 months, according to data from the official Health and Social Care Information Centre. But the actual number affected by their mother' s drinking could be far greater, experts have warned. Scroll down for video . Warning: New figures show that 272 youngsters left disabled by Foetal Alcohol Syndrome were hospitalised in England over the past 12 months, according to the official Health and Social Care Information Centre . Research by the World Health Organisation suggests that at least one in 100 babies born in the UK could suffer learning, behavioural and physical problems such as deformed limbs because of exposure to alcohol, according to the Sunday People. That equates to about 7,500 every year. Elizabeth Mitchell, of the National Organisation for Foetal Alchol Syndrome, told reporter Nicola Fifield: 'Children born with the syndrome don't get better. They are brain damaged. 'It is an enormous problem and one that is terribly sad and vastly under-diagnosed.' TIp of the iceberg: Research by the World Health Organisation suggests that at least one in 100 babies born in the UK could suffer learning and behavioural problems because of exposure to alcohol in the womb . One teenager who was born with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome is 15-year-old Niamh Brown. She needs help getting dressed, has no sense of danger and will never be able to live independently. Niamh was three when her adoptive parents Julia and Simon first noticed something was wrong. She stuggled at playschool, having difficulty holding a pencil and paying attention. Two years later, at the age of five, Niamh was diagnosed with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome from her birth mother's drinking. In 2007, Julia and Simon set up the Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Trust to help others. Visit www.fasdtrust.co.uk . Other medical issues associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy include problems with the liver, kidneys and heart, cerebral palsy, sight loss and epilepsy. Pregnant women are advised by the Government not to drink alcohol. If they do, the maximum consumption recommended is up to two units no more than twice a week. But Ms Mitchell believes the guidance should be changed so that women are advised not to drink at all during pregnancy.","272 children left disabled by alcohol exposure were hospitalised last year .

"They're two words that strike fear into parents' hearts and leave the entire family exhausted and emotional: temper tantrum. These outbursts can be triggered by anything from being refused an ice cream to frustration at an early bedtime. Now a new video created by Oprah Winfrey's OWN TV, reveals just what's happening in a child's mind when they become angry and upset - and the best way to help them calm down. Scroll down for video . When I'm mad, my brain can get a headache and it can start hurting,' says one child, explaining what goes on in his head when he starts to feel angry . A group of children describe their feelings in the midst of a passionate outburst, in a video featured on Super Soul Sunday, Oprah's Emmy award-winning TV series. And while mindfulness has become the latest buzzword when it comes to dealing with stress and bolstering your mental well-being for adults, it seems children are also benefiting from it. The video titled, What Children Can Teach Us About Anger, is described as showing that 'you're never too old, or too young, to discover mindfulness and let anger go. 'In this short, we hear from children who have already learned a life-changing lesson - taking a deep breath can change your whole world.' Talking about what happens in their minds when they get angry, the children in the video explain how it's easy to feel out of control. 'When I'm mad, my brain can get a headache and it can start hurting,' says one. Mindfulness has become the latest buzzword when it comes to dealing with stress and bolstering your mental well being. And it seems that you're never too young to learn the art . Learning to simply take a deep breath can help children diffuse their own anger. 'My brain slows down and then I feel more calm, and then I'm ready to speak,' explains one child already using the technique . 'First, you find a place where you can be alone. Then you find some way to relax and calm down,' says another little girl, explaining how she uses mindfulness techniques to combat feelings of anger. While another goes into more detail about his temper: 'Your blood keeps pumping because you're really mad. You start to get sweaty because you're getting really, really mad. And then when you start getting really mad, you turn red.' One little girl offers up an analogy to explain her anger, using a jam jar and glitter. 'It's kind of like if you had a jar. The jar would be your brain, and then you put glitter in the jar. 'If you shook up the jar and the glitter went everywhere, that would be how your mind looks.' These children all seem to have the presence of mind to know what to do when they find themselves lost in a passion. 'First, you find a place where you can be alone. Then you find some way to relax and calm down,' explains one little girl. 'My brain slows down and then I feel more calm, and then I'm ready to speak,' explains another girl, who appears to have mastered the art of mindfulness at a remarkably  young age . Others expand on how to use deep breaths to refocus the mind. 'Your blood keeps pumping because you're really mad. You start to get sweaty because you're getting really, really mad. And then when you start getting really mad, you turn red,' says one child, struggling with anger . 'I breathe in through my nose,' explains one, while another adds that she likes to close her eyes while taking deep breaths. 'My brain slows down and then I feel more calm, and then I'm ready to speak,' explains the youngster who used the glitter analogy. 'It's like all the sparkles are at the bottom of your brain.' Defined by the NHS as paying more attention to the present moment, and to your own thoughts and feelings, mindfulness is fast becoming a tool for the masses . 'My brain slows down and then I feel more calm, and then I'm ready to speak,' explains a little girl who appears to have mastered the art of mindfulness at a very young age . Studies claim that adopting a more 'mindful' approach to life can not only reduce your daily stress, but prolong your mental health. It's also a key tool in helping people deal with their feelings of anger and frustration. Mark Williams, professor of clinical psychology at the Oxford Mindfulness Centre, explained that the technique can allows us to 'become more aware of the stream of thoughts and feelings that we experience'. Adding that by taking the time to consider what we're really feeling, and why, can help to quickly diffuse reactions and behaviour that are 'unhelpful' or unpleasant.","Children star in new video from Oprah Winfrey's OWN TV network .

"Three women who were filmed twerking in front a Second World War memorial in Russia have been jailed for hooliganism. In a YouTube video, six dancers are seen performing the provocative and popular move along to music while stood in front of the Malaya Zemlya monument in Novorossiysk, southern Russia. Prosecutors said their 'erotic and sexual twerk dance' was disrespectful to those who fought in the war and jailed two of the women for ten days and a third for 15 days. Scroll down for video . 'Hooliganism': Three women have been jailed after releasing a video of their dance group twerking in front of the Malaya Zemlya monument in Novorossiysk, southern Russia . Two others escaped with fines, while another dancer avoided punishment altogether as she was under 16 - with a reprimand being handed down to her mother instead. According to the BBC, prosecutors said: 'This incident of disrespect for the memory of war history is unacceptable and any attempts to desecrate sites of military glory will be stopped immediately.' The Youtube video currently has more than 400,000 views and sees the six dancers performing a well-choreographed one and a half minute routine. After surfacing earlier this week,it was brought to the attention of the mayor of Novorossiysk, where the women are from. The mayor was said to be 'outraged' and personally charged officials with identifying the names of the performers - who posted the video to attract new recruits to their modern dance school . 'We condemn these women. Every inch of this land is covered in blood. It is inappropriate,' said Viktoriya Dikaya, the press secretary for the city's education department. Recruitment video: The one minute 30 second clip was posted by the women to encourage people to join their dance school . Punished: Two of the girls were jailed for ten days, while a third was sentenced to 15 days in prison. Two others were fined, while the sixth dancer escaped punishment as she was under 16 . Prosecutors are now said to be  carrying out checks at the institutions where the women, who were all under 30, are enrolled, to make sure they are in compliance with 'programs aimed at ensuring respect for the law among their members', reports RT.com. The Malaya Zemlya memorial, completed in 1982, commemorates a battle to free Novorossiysk from German occupation in 1943. The women's sentences come as Russia prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the Second World War victory. The incident comes just weeks after Russian officials closed down a dance school after footage emerged of teenage students performing hip-thrusting moves on stage. The video clip, entitled Winnie the Pooh and the Bees, showed a group of teenage girls dancing in striped leotards, long socks and mini-skirts at the Orenburg dance school in southwest of the country. Condemned: Prosecutors said the women's 'erotic and sexual twerk dance' was disrespectful to those who fought in the Second World War . Increased sensitivity: The women's sentences come as Russia prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the Second World War victory . A committee is currently investigating whether the hip-thrusting performance amounts to negligence or even 'debauched action' - punishable by a range of sanctions from community service to three years behind bars. In 2012, members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot were jailed after performing a protest song in Moscow's main cathedral - also on charges of hooliganism. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina were not released until the end of 2013 after their act was seen as 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred'.

"The prospect of a Labour government is knocking up to 10 per cent off the price of some of Britain's most expensive homes, it has been claimed. Wealthy buyers are demanding a lower 'Ed Miliband' price to compensate for any future mansion tax bills introduced by the Labour leader if he becomes Prime Minister. Estate agents in London are now said to be offering a higher 'Cameron price' and lower 'Miliband price' for the same property. Labour leader Ed Miliband, on the BBC's Andrew Marr show (left), has pledged to introduce a mansion tax on properties worth over £2million. The annual levy will hit his own home in north London (right) Mr Miliband has pledged to introduce an annual levy on homes worth more than £2million to raise money for the NHS. Under plans drawn up by shadow chancellor Ed Balls, homeowners with properties worth between £2million and £3million will be forced to pay £3,000 a year in mansion tax. Owners of homes worth more than £3million will have to pay even more. The Tories have dubbed the proposal the 'homes tax' and warned that families living in much more modest properties could be dragged into the levy. Mr Milliband himself has admitted that his North London home would be hit by his party's planned annual levy. David Cameron, on Sky's Murnaghan show this morning, has criticised Labour's proposed mansion tax as a 'home tax' A Labour government could see people's mortgage bills soar by £1,000 a year, George Osborne has claimed. The Chancellor warned warned that the prospect of Ed Miliband propped up by the SNP would lead to a 'clear and present danger' of rising interest rates. Predicting increases in mortgage rates, he said: 'A 1% rise in interest rates would hit the family with the average mortgage with an extra £1,000 bill a year. The price is paid by working people.' The Labour leader lives in a four-bedroom semi-detached house in Dartmouth Park valued at around £2.7million. But if Mr Miliband ever came to sell his home as Prime Minister he could be forced to lower the price to cover the costs of his own mansion tax. According to the Sunday Times, one buyer who is about to exchange contracts on a £15million property in St John's Wood, north London, has threatened to drop his offer to £13.5million if the deal is not completed before May 7 and Mr Miliband becomes Prime Minister. In Notting Hill, west London, a buyer of a property for sale just above £2million has said he will only pay that price only if David Cameron makes it back to Number 10. Miles Meacock, of Strutt & Parker, the estate agent, in Notting Hill, told the Sunday Times that the bidder who had trimmed £100,000 from their offer for a £2m property, wanted to be sure of permanently avoiding the burden of mansion tax. He said: 'If the Tories win, he will come back to the table. This is likely to be a phenomenon for the next two weeks.' According to the property website Rightmove 77 homes previously listed for sale above £2million have been reduced to below the 'mansion tax level' in the past six weeks. Ed Mead, an executive director at the London estate agent Douglas & Gordon, some sellers are so concerned about the mansion tax putting off potential buyers that they have told prospective buyers they will cover the full cost of it for a five-year Labour term. The Liberal Democrats have a similar mansion tax proposal. Nick Clegg wants to charge £2,000 a year on properties worth between £2million and £2.5million, rising to £3,500 for those worth between £2.5million and £3million, £5,000 for £3million to £4million and £9,000 for those worth up to £5million.","Estate agents are offering a 'Cameron price' and a lower 'Miliband price'

"Built at a cost of £1 billion, New Broadcasting House is the jewel in the crown of the BBC and the setting for its self-mocking satire W1A. But in a development that could have come straight out of the sitcom, it has been revealed that the Corporation is paying tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money to book meetings in nearby buildings because the headquarters lacks space. New Broadcasting House in Central London covers half a million square feet, took a decade to build and was opened by the Queen in 2013 – four years behind schedule and at least £55 million over budget. Scroll down for video . The BBC has admitted it 'occasionally' runs out of meeting rooms in its £1billion New Broadcasting House . The huge steel-and-glass building has specially designed 'huddle zones' and a 'meeting tower' on stilts in the atrium. One of the running jokes in W1A is that its fictional meeting rooms are named after popular entertainers – Hugh Bonneville's character Ian Fletcher, the BBC's 'Head of Values', frequently meets colleagues 'inside Frankie Howerd'. Now, in response to a freedom of information request, the BBC has admitted it 'occasionally' runs out of meeting rooms and spent £47,198 on booking external spaces nearby during the last financial year. Corporation insiders say these venues include De Vere's West One business centre and the luxury Langham Hotel – both just across the street from New Broadcasting House – and that meetings have included 'leadership breakfasts'. The huge building has specially designed 'huddle zones' and a 'meeting tower' on stilts in the atrium . One source said: 'The leadership breakfasts at De Vere are renowned for the lavish catering. The BBC is cutting jobs but can still afford to cater for breakfast meetings for senior managers.' Another said: 'It's bonkers to hold meetings across the street.' The BBC has been criticised by spending watchdog the National Audit Office (NAO) over the running costs of New Broadcasting House, which are almost double that of comparable buildings in Central London. A BBC spokesman said: 'It is occasionally necessary to book nearby venues, especially for larger meetings. Value for money is always taken into account.' But Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said licence fee-payers would be furious over spiralling costs. New Broadcasting House is home to three 24-hour news channels, nine radio networks and 6,000 staff.","New Broadcasting House in central London took a decade to build .

A director of the UK-based Biogerontology Research Foundation think tank, which is dedicated to longer life and improving the health of the elderly, Dr Zhavoronkov remains confident that his lifestyle will allow him to reach the 150-year milestone. He also makes sure he is administered with vaccines as soon as they are available, according to The Sunday Telegraph, while monitoring his blood biochemistry and cell counts. 'All of the supercentenarians alive today lived through tough times, when no antibiotics were available and our understanding of human biology was not that far from the Stone Age,' he said. 'I think that in two to three years we will have effective pharmacological solutions based on already approved drugs that will help people remain younger and healthier until other advances in regenerative medicine and gene therapy become available.' Secret to long life: Dr Zhavoronkov is combining drugs and supplements with frequent health checks (pictured) and regular exercise as part of his quest for longevity. He is confident he can live to 150 years old . According to the Office for National Statistics, a boy born in the UK today is expected to live to 78.8 years and a girl to 82.8 years. Many health experts think most people can exceed that by walking regularly, cutting down on fat, sugar and salt in their diets and using existing drugs such as statins.

"In February of this year, bride-to-be Adele McKenzie found the dress she had dreamed of wearing when she married her partner of nine years, David Elliot. Little did she know she would never get the chance to wear it, despite already paying for half. The 31-year-old said when she slipped into the white lacy gown, she instantly saw herself standing in front of her friends and family and exchanging marriage vows with the love of her life. ‘I had dreamt about this princess dress since I was a little girl,’ she told Daily Mail Australia. Adele McKenzie was set to marry the love of her life, David Elliot, when she was devastated to learn the bridal company she had paid around $1,000 to for her dress had closed down . Ms McKenzie said she wasn't able to buy the $2,000 dress outright so she organised a payment plan with ‘The Bridal Centre’. She started paying in February and planned to pay off her dress by July - around three months before her wedding - giving her time to make alterations. In early April, Ms McKenzie’s dress dream was shattered when she opened an email from the bridal company that said they were going bankrupt. Ms McKenzie told Daily Mail Australia she was left feeling ‘panicked’ and ‘anxious’ when she was faced with the news that she would need to find a new wedding dress for her big day. ‘My first reaction was to call The Bridal Centre and it was consistently busy across the long weekend. Their Facebook was active and we were putting up posts without a response.' The Bridal Centre's Facebook page was inundated with messages from disappointed brides who already had their hearts set on a wedding dress . Ms McKenzie was one of around 140 brides who received the same ‘generic’ email informing them their dream dresses may not be coming, some of them with their weddings only weeks away. She tried to go onto the Bridal Centre's website but it was deactivated and that's when she realised she had no way of getting in contact with the company she already paid $1,000, which was meant to go towards paying off her dress. The happy couple have been together for nine years and plan to wed in November 2015 . ‘It was stressful and pretty upsetting,’ she said. Ms McKenzie was one of around 140 brides who received the same ‘generic’ email informing them their dream dresses may not be coming, some of them with weddings only weeks away. Amid the devastation, the brides-to-be banded together to create a Facebook page that would allow them to 'connect' and 'support each other' through the confusing time. Ms McKenzie said the group called ‘Where’s My Dress?’ became inundated with ‘generous offers’ from ‘lovely ladies’ and ‘amazing bridal companies’ who offered them free ‘pre-loved’, and even brand new, wedding gowns. While some women have received their money back, unfortunately Ms McKenzie said she is still waiting to hear from the Bridal Centre about whether she will be one of the lucky ones who can use that money to buy another dress. Ms McKenzie revealed she would need another $1,000 deposit to move forward with a different dress, however at this stage, with all the financial pressure that comes with planning a wedding, she isn't sure she can afford it. ‘It’s very difficult financially, I can’t take the next step to get another dress. I don’t know if I’m going to get it back.’ ‘I am six months out of my wedding and I’m anxious and stressed out,' she said. Amid the devastation, the brides-to-be banded together to create a Facebook page that would allow them to 'connect' and 'support each other' through the confusing time. Ms McKenzie is expecting around 70 guests at her wedding that will be held in Sydney's Terrey Hills, with some travelling from interstate and overseas. 'There’s a lot of planning and  it’s added pressure on top.' 'It’s getting more difficult as the weeks draw closer,’ she added. Ms McKenzie said the trusting brides had no idea the company was facing financial difficulties as they continued to take payments from their clients right up until the day before they sent the email that notified them of their money woes. ‘[It] is just disgraceful. They knew what was happening. If they didn't want to tell us the truth, that’s fine, but don’t take our money,’ she said. ‘At the end of the day, I’m marrying the man of my dreams so I’m trying to not let it affect it too much.’ After thinking she had secured the dress she had dreamed of since she was a little girl, Ms McKenzie said she was devastated she was going to have to fight to get it back. ‘You find this dress and you fall in love with it. Now I have to go through this process, it’s so upsetting. ‘I don’t want this,’ she added. Ms McKenzie said despite her awful experience she is trying to move forward and instead focus on  on the man who will be standing at the end of the aisle, regardless of what she is wearing. ‘At the end of the day, I’m marrying the man of my dreams so I’m trying to not let it affect it too much.’","The Bridal Centre, in Brisbane, shut down unexpectedly earlier this month .

"It's official: alcohol makes you more attractive to the opposite sex. And that's when you are boozing, not them. Scientists at the University of Bristol found that having 'one large glass of wine' increases 'facial flushing' and 'confidence', making the drinker 'more attractive' to others and more likely to 'get lucky'. Researchers quizzed 40 heterosexual male and female students and asked them to rate the attractiveness of three groups of people who were sober, tipsy and drunk. A study of 40 men and women found drinking a glass of wine makes you more attractive to the opposite sex... ...but too much booze leads to 'excessive and unattractive' changes in facial expressions, like Bridget Jones . The study found that tipsy people, who had downed one large 250ml glass of 14 per cent wine - that's one-third of the bottle - were consistently voted as the 'most attractive'. Sober subjects and those who had 'had a few too many' were rated as far less attractive than a 'tipsy' subject. Academics have previously confirmed the existence of the 'beer goggles' phenomenon - in which boozers find other people more attractive after several drinks. This new study, however, is the first time it had been shown that the drinker themselves actually 'becomes more attractive' to others, in an experiment dubbed 'reverse beer goggles'. The study found that alcohol had a 'positive pulling power', but only if the subject was 'not hammered'. It states that booze 'mimics' how a person's body 'demonstrates it is healthy and attractive to attract potential mates' and that facial flushing is perceived by others as 'healthy and attractive'. Alcohol also makes people seem in a 'more positive or jolly mood' and encourages people to 'relax' and give off 'positive' signals, such as smiling - increasing their attractiveness levels. The study states: 'In addition to perceiving others as more attractive, an alcohol consumer may also be perceived by others as more attractive, and therefore receive greater sexual interest from potential mates. 'An increase in such attention from others may also positively reinforce alcohol consumption, particularly in social contexts.' The study found alcohol has 'positive pulling power' but only if the person isn't too intoxicated . The study said, however, that too much booze led to 'changes in facial expressions which were excessive and unattractive' - leading to a decrease in 'pulling power'. It adds: 'In conclusion, our data indicate that alcohol consumption may lead to consumers being rated as more attractive than sober individuals, but only following low levels of consumption. 'At higher levels of consumption this effect is not observed, and may even be reversed.' Professor Marcus Munafo, a senior researcher on the Bristol University study, said: 'The people who had consumed a small amount of alcohol had a slightly rosier complexion than they did in their sober and high-dose photos. 'Rosiness is attractive because it characterises good physical health characteristics. 'You consume a drink, so you see other people as more attractive, but you also become more attractive yourself because you've consumed a drink. 'But if they go on to consume more alcohol, they're no longer rated as more attractive.' In a previous study last year, again at the University of Bristol, it was found that 'beer goggles' - in which booze makes others seems more attractive - was a proven phenomena. Volunteers drank either alcohol or a non-alcoholic placebo before looking at images of men's and women's faces - as well a landscape portraits. Those who drank alcohol found all three image types more attractive compared with those who did not. David Simmons, 31, of High Wycombe, Bucks, said last week: 'So if I want to pull I need to drink either a third of a bottle of wine or a couple of pints and then draw a line under boozing for the night. 'I can't really see that happened as after a couple you always want more, but if it improves my chances of pulling I'll give it a shot.'","Study finds booze 'mimics' how a person's body demonstrates health .

"David Cameron will put small business at the heart of the election campaign today by declaring that the Conservatives are ‘the party of the grafters’. The Prime Minister, who has faced criticism over a campaign lacking in passion, said he made ‘no apology’ for focusing on the economy, insisting: ‘Nothing matters more.’ He will appeal to small firms and the self-employed, saying while Labour sneers at those who work hard, his party backs them. Scroll down for video . David Cameron will put small business at the heart of the election campaign today by declaring that the Conservatives are ‘the party of the grafters’ Yesterday, Mr Cameron defended his campaign against criticism it is too narrow. ‘If you want political excitement, maybe you could go to Greece,’ he said. ‘That’s an exciting country, I am told. I don’t think that’s exciting – I think that’s terrifying. ‘When you get a new job, a new home, get a new childcare place or start a new business... now that’s truly exciting. If you want to take a risk, vote for the other man. My God, he’s got plenty of risks.’ He said Labour’s ‘disastrous’ plans for higher taxes and borrowing would risk the stability of people’s lives. And he told voters: ‘I want you to think about the three million low-paid people we have taken out of income tax, I want you to think about the two million jobs that we have created, I want you to think of the cuts in youth unemployment that we’ve achieved. I want you to think of that and I want you to take that argument that Labour make and stick it where the sun don’t shine.’ Mr Cameron went on: ‘Some people are saying to me, “You are putting too much emphasis on a strong and stable economy and securing our future”. I plead guilty.’ The Tories will today unveil a separate manifesto for small businesses, calling them ‘the lifeblood of the economy’. Thousands of small business leaders will back the party in an open letter. The Prime Minister, who has faced criticism over a campaign lacking in passion, said he made ‘no apology’ for focusing on the economy, insisting: ‘Nothing matters more’ And Mr Cameron – who is understood to have ordered that all campaigning activity is now dedicated to the economy – will set out new proposals to support millions of small firms and self-employed. He is to promise tax breaks and start-up loans, and an end to another £10billion-worth of red tape, to enable the creation of 600,000 businesses a year. The Tories are also promising to review the disadvantages faced by the self-employed, who make up 15 per cent of the workforce. In an echo of the campaign rhetoric of Margaret Thatcher, who famously celebrated Napoleon’s supposed dismissal of Britain as a ‘nation of shopkeepers’, Mr Cameron will say: ‘Small businesses are the backbone of our economy – and Conservatives are behind them 100 per cent. We’re the party of the grafters and the roofers and the retailers and the plumbers. ‘We get them, we respect them, we understand them, we back them. Where Labour sneer, we cheer.’","David Cameron will put small business at the heart of election campaign .

"The average Briton eats four servings of cheese a week . We Britons certainly do love to keep things local, as over three quarters of us (80 per cent) go crackers for cheddar, crowning it our favourite cheese variety. Least favourite cheeses, according to a new survey, are Greek feta, French Camembert and American cream cheese. And while the French are renowned for their love of the stinky stuff, we are not far behind, with the average Briton eating their way through four servings a week. The research, which was conducted by pickle brand Branston also revealed that a surprising one in four cheese fanatics (26 per cent) admit to eating melted cheese with everything. A third of Brits (30 per cent) say they can't enjoy cheese without a dollop of their favourite pickle while almost three quarters admitted to reaching out for a cheese sandwich when feeling peckish. In fact, three in ten office workers tuck into cheese sandwiches for lunch each work day without fail. If we're not putting slices in our sandwiches, one in ten of us are eating whole blocks of cheese in one sitting. Our second favourite is mozzarella with almost two in five (38 per cent) enjoying the ever versatile soft Italian cheese. Close behind in third place is traditional red Leicester (32 per cent). The French cheese board staple Brie placed fourth (29 per cent) followed by Italian Parmesan in fifth (24 per cent).

This is the equivalent of eating over 1,000 identical cheese sandwiches. Commenting on our attraction to repetition, food psychologist, Greg Tucker, who worked with Lurpak said: 'This research demonstrates that the repetition of eating the same food every day can provide reassurance and stability. 'However we all have an innate desire for exploration and would benefit from shaking things up.

"Broadcaster Stephen A. Smith has once again taken a controversial stance on domestic violence on ESPN's First Take. Nine months after Smith received a one-week suspension for claiming women can play a role in provoking men into violence, Smith tried to to claim that boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr's career should be looked at separate from his domestic violence history. In the discussion, he told fellow anchor Cari Champion that he understood why she disagreed with his stance because she was a woman and 'should feel that way'. Scroll down for video . ESPN's First Take anchor Stephen A. Smith is under fire for claiming that Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s boxing career should be looked at independently from his domestic violence history . Responding to a 'Good vs. Evil' approach  Manny Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach is taking prior to the boxer's upcoming fight against Mayweather, Smith questioned how Mayweather is being portrayed in the media. When co-host Cari Champion said she had an issue with Mayweather's domestic violence history, Smith said that was because she's a woman and 'should feel that way . Mayweather has been convicted twice for domestic violence, according to the New York Post. 'What makes me uncomfortable is that they're also lumping all of this other stuff that Floyd Mayweather allegedly has done to say, ""Well, you know what? Look at how much of a bad guy he is"",' Smith told Champion and Skip Bayless on April 8. He added: 'When you take the position that you take, Cari, against - I got no problems with this, you're a woman, you should feel that way - anybody else, based on what he's been accused of, I get that. I have no issue whatsoever.' Champion jumped in, saying: 'I definitely have an issue with his domestic-violence record, but I also have an issue with how he treats women period outside the ring.' Smith stuck with his words, claiming that Champion only holds the position she has because she is a woman. He said: 'I'm saying that her position is clear because she's a woman, and this is how she feels he conducts himself. 'I am a boxing fan. When I'm talking about Mayweather-Pacquiao, I'm thinking about two dudes strictly in the boxing ring. And that's all I'm doing. 'But Freddie Roach takes this to another level.

During the discussion, Smith alluded to women in abuse cases when he said, 'Let's make sure we don't do anything to provoke wrong action... we got to also make sure that you can do your part to do whatever you can do to make, to try to make sure it doesn't happen again.'","Stephen A.

"Most couples will admit to assisting each other with the odd bit of behind-closed-doors grooming, but it usually goes as far as squeezing a hard-to-reach pimple. But Sharon and Mike Tierney have taken their mutual upkeep to a whole new level, believing that 'the couple that waxes together, stays together.' The Sydney-based duo set aside an evening once a month to tend to all their beauty maintenance needs. Sharon, 45, trims her 40-year-old husband's eyebrows, wax his nostrils and even grooms his pubic hair. Scroll down for video . High maintenance: Sydney couple Mike and Sharon Tierney set aside one evening per month for mutual grooming . You wax my back, I'll wax yours: Sharon trims her husband's eyebrows, waxes his nostrils and trims his pubic hairs, while he returns the favours with waxing, spray tans and eyelash tints . For his part, Mike has been well trained in the art of waxing, and waxes her underarms, legs, upper lip and chin, and can even perform a Brazilian wax. The British ex-pat can also tint eyelashes and give Sharon a spray tan. Sharon admits while some women are horrified about their man seeing their lady parts in all their hairy glory, she says there's no limitations to their marriage. 'He’s seen everything, there’s nothing I wouldn't not let him see,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Being a well-groomed gentleman can be a dangerous undertaking though. Regime: While most couples may admit to assisting each other with squeezing the odd hard-to-reach pimple, but Sharon and Mike take it to a whole new level . Close cut: One hair incident involved Sharon attempting to give her husband a 'number one', and ended up cutting his scrotum . 'He says it’s for neatness,' Sharon said of her husband's preference for a 'number one' in the pubic region, 'but I think it’s to gain that precious “optical inch”.' One evening during their usual pluck, wax and clipping session, things got a little bit hairy. 'I thought we should stretch the optical illusion to its limits, so I removed the clipper guard to get the closest possible trim. We were coasting along brilliantly until we hit the scrotum and its soft, sagging, sensitive skin,' she said. The worst happened, and a poor, screaming Mike was left with a bleeding cut in the most sensitive of body parts. 'I was just trying to make his penis look bigger,' said Sharon. 'Not that it’s not big, but that’s what men want isn’t it?”' The trimmed twosome began their mutual grooming regime together 13 years ago. The couple met in London at a Pop Idol party when Sharon was on a holiday to the UK. Their fling turned into a relationship, with Sharon moving to London. During her time their, she struggled to find a decent waxing therapist. Upon returning to Australia, Sharon spent six months training in beauty therapy to open her own salon, and turned to her husband to play guinea pig. Guinea pig: Mike was enlisted when Sharon was training to become a professional waxer and needed someone to practise on . Mike was enlisted to step in when she was training up her junior therapists. 'One of the girls said her boyfriend could do it but they broke up two days before and we needed a model and I told Mike we were desperate - and he agreed, Sharon told Daily Mail Australia. 'God love him, there he was butt naked in front of my blonde, 20 year old staff, he would do anything to support me.' In business: After struggling to find a decent wax while living in London, Sharon trained and opened her own salon upon returning to Australia . 'He's a good sport and just goes along with it - which is nice because he's English and very conservative - it shows he will do anything for me.' 'I get Mike to use a bit of both types of wax. Usually strip wax on your labia is too sensitive, so I use it around the edges and use a hot wax on intimate areas, such as Veet Naturals Warm Wax.' While the sliced scrotum wasn't severe enough to land Mike in the hospital, an ill-timed bout of appendicitis did spell embarrassment for the Englishman. 'It was only an hour after getting waxed he was rushed to hospital with emergency appendicitis,' said Sharon. 'A young female doctor  said, ""I'm really sorry we have to check your testicles,"" and he was so embarrassed. From London to Oz: The couple met in the UK when Australian Sharon was there on holiday 13 years ago . Metro man: From clipping and trimming to waxing and tinting, men are more open to beauty maintenance than ever . 'She asked what I did for a living and I said - ""you’re about to find out!"" She was in fits of laughter when I told her and poor Mike had all these doctors checking out his freshly waxed scrotum.' 'But in the end because all the hospital staff knew, everyone ended up taking brochures and we got a heap of new clients, so it turned it into a positive thing. Not to mention he quite enjoyed all the nurses saying ""oh you’re the one with the Brazilian."" ' As for their ventures 'down under' together, Sharon has now written a tell-all book to give women guidance on what's normal down there and a expose on their hilarious adventures together, aptly titled 'The Vagina Buffet.' 'I think when you put your hand on someone’s vagina it’s like they get verbal diarrhoea, they want to get comfortable with you and tell you everything, it’s unbelievable how much I've learned about people and the vagina.'","Mike and Sharon Tierney set aside one night a month for grooming regime .

"David Cameron has warned voters that they have '11 days to save Britain', as he claimed Scottish nationalists 'don't want the country to succeed'. The Prime Minister said the Scottish National Party would prop up a minority Labour administration in the hope that the government would be a 'disaster' and bring forward its dream of independence. But Liberal Democrat Cabinet minster Danny Alexander accused the Prime Minister of 'playing with fire' by stirring up ill-feeling between Scotland and England in a way that would only fuel support for independence in next year's Scottish Parliament elections. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, addressing supporters in Somerset this afternoon, has warned voters that they have '11 days to save Britain', as he claimed Scottish nationalists 'don't want the country to succeed' The Prime Minister - taking a selfie with supporters today, said the Scottish National Party would prop up a minority Labour administration in the hope that the government would be a 'disaster' and bring forward its dream of independence . The warnings came as polls indicated that the General Election race was still neck and neck, with the UK heading for a hung parliament and coalition negotiations after May 7. A Survation poll put the Conservatives three points ahead on 33 per cent to Labour's 30 per cent. However, other polls had Labour nudging ahead. Today's Survation poll found that more than a third of English voters would not regard a Miliband administration propped up by the SNP as 'legitimate'. More than two-fifths - 44 per cent - meanwhile said that they would rather see England break away from Scotland than have an arrangement of this kind. Mr Cameron told the Sunday Express that an outright Conservative victory could make Britain 'one of the great international success stories of the next decade'. The Prime Minister echoed Tony Blair's 'education, education, education' slogan when he said his three top priorities would be 'economy, economy, economy'. But he warned: 'There are 11 days left to save the economy, to save jobs, effectively to save Britain.' A Survation poll has put the Conservatives three points ahead on 33 per cent to Labour's 30 per cent . Mr Cameron was interviewed on the Murnaghan programme, broadcast this morning, warning of the threat posed by the SNP . Mr Cameron said that the SNP 'want to achieve the break-up of our country, so therefore if you have a Labour government backed by the SNP, you have got a government backed by people who don't want the country to succeed. 'They don't want parliament to succeed. They don't want the government to succeed. They don't want the United Kingdom to succeed. That is really worrying.' Nicola Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond will want voters to look back after five years of a minority Labour adminstration made possible by the SNP and think 'that was a disaster, now can we break up the United Kingdom altogether?', said the Prime Minister. Mr Alexander was highly critical of the Conservatives' decision to focus their election campaign on the threat of Scottish nationalism. Ed Miliband, appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning, insisted Labour would not do any deals with the SNP . The Labour leader is under growing pressure to rule out governing with the support of SNP MPs . The Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury told The Observer: 'I think the Tory campaign has been a total disgrace. I think they are deliberately trying to stir up ill-feeling between Scotland and England in a desperate attempt to fend off Ukip and I think it has long-term consequences. When you stoke tensions, you are playing with fire.' Mr Alexander added: 'I think a majority Tory government would be a disaster for the whole of the United Kingdom because it would lurch this country to the right economically ... but it would be a particular disaster in Scotland, because it would give the SNP what they most want . - a grievance to nurse for the Scottish parliamentary election in 2016.'

"The broccoli chemical sulforaphane is known to block the inflammation and damage to cartilage associated with arthritis (file picture) An artificial version of a compound in broccoli could hold the key to treating arthritis, say researchers. The broccoli chemical sulforaphane is known to block the inflammation and damage to cartilage associated with the condition. But patients would have to eat several pounds of the vegetable every day to derive any significant benefit. Sulforaphane in its natural form is also too unstable to turn into a medicine. But UK drug company Evgen Pharma has developed a stable synthetic version of the chemical that offers the potential of a pill treatment. A single dose of the drug, known as Sulforadex or SFX-01, is the equivalent of eating 5.5lb of broccoli in one day. In tests on mice affected by osteoarthritis, Sulforadex significantly improved bone architecture, gait balance and movement. Professor Andrew Pitsillides, who co-led the research at the Royal Veterinary College in London, said: ‘These initial results are very positive for such an experiment and we have convinced ourselves that sulforaphane is a promising agent for the treatment of osteoarthritis. ‘The clinical development of sulforaphane has been held back by the fact that it is inherently unstable – SFX-01 is a major advance in this area.’ Professor Pitsillides added: ‘Nearly nine million people in the UK have osteoarthritis and it costs the NHS more than £5 billion every year. But UK drug company Evgen Pharma has developed a stable synthetic version of the chemical that offers the potential of a pill treatment (file picture) 'There is no cure or effective treatment for the disease other than pain relief or joint replacement, so the potential for SFX-01 is massive.’ Broccoli is also believed to reduce the risk of some cancers and cardiovascular disease, and improve symptoms of autism. A University of Pittsburgh study found it could be used to prevent throat cancer. In laboratory tests, extracts from broccoli were shown to give mice protection against oral cancer.","Sulforaphane known to block inflammation and damage to the cartilage .

"Like many teenage girls, Madison Hurd had been dreaming of her prom all year. But a sudden infection landed the 16-year-old junior from Seward, Nebraska in the hospital, and it seemed like there was no chance she'd make it to her special night. That is, until nurses and Hurd's friends brought prom right to her bed at the Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Omaha. After a sudden infection landed Madison Hurd, 16, in the hospital and forced her to miss her high school's prom, nurses and her friends brought the Great Gatsby-themed dance to her bed instead . Nurses spent their day off doing Hurd's nails, makeup and hair, getting music and a cake, and decorating her room with streamers and balloons . Nurses spent their day off doing Hurd's nails, makeup and hair, getting music and a cake, and decorating her room with streamers and balloons, according to Live Well Nebraska. They even made sure the decorations matched the Great Gatsby-themed dance Hurd had been planning and organizing for the last year with her student council at Milford High School. The stunning turquoise ball gown Hurd had started an after-school job to afford was laid over her hospital gown, and her boyfriend flew in from Alabama with a tux and a corsage. Hurd's mother Catrece said the nurse's efforts brought her to tears. 'It's their day off. When I think about it, I just don't know what else to say,' she told WOWT. 'They surprised us with everything. There are no words to explain and thank the staff enough about helping her have her dream night during such a stressful time in her life,' Catrece told Live Well Nebraska. Hurd's boyfriend flew in from Alabama with a tux and a corsage, and the turquoise gown the teen had gotten an after-school job to afford was laid over her hospital gown . The teen was hospitalized on Monday with what was initially thought to be a stomach bug that turned into sepsis, a life-threatening complication of an infection. Catrece said the sepsis attacked Hurd's muscles and her heart, and she has not been able to leave the hospital since. 'When we found out she was having some heart problems, that's when we knew there was no way she was going to be able to go to the prom,' she told KETV. Hurd has since been diagnosed with myocarditis, an inflammation of the middle layer of the heart wall. The teen said she was 'exhausted' but thought it was awesome that the hospital put in so much work to make her dream come true. 'I'm just very happy, very happy,' she said.

"Holden have been left red-faced after having to recall more than 26,000 of its vehicles because they could be at risk of catching alight. After five customers reported having 'thermal incidents', Holden issued a stop delivery notice to car dealers and urged owners of the Holden Colorado- SUV or ute- to have their cars checked out immediately. Spanning just over a year, the models said to be affected were made in Thailand between September 2013 and January 2015. After five customers reported having 'thermal incidents', Holden issued a stop delivery notice to car dealers and urged owners of the Holden Colorado- SUV or ute- to have their cars checked out immediately . This latest safety issue makes Holden the most recalled car brand in 2015. Last year, Holden shared the title of most recalls with Jeep after issuing 14 notices to recall around nine vehicles- including the Holden Barina, the Holden Cruze and the Holden TJ Trax- amid safety concerns. A website run by the federal government confirmed there is a risk 'cable insulation' in the Colorado 'may melt of catch fire.' Holden said the issue is caused by an alternator cable making unnecessary contact with a steel bracket on the battery tray. They said under certain driving conditions the movement of the engine could cause the cable to rub through the insulation, potentially causing a short circuit. This latest safety issue makes Holden the most recalled car brand in 2015, with five recalls in only four months . 'If the short circuit creates sufficient heat, there is a risk that the cable insulation may melt or potentially catch fire,' Holden told Newscorp in a statement. Holden said drivers should look out for warning signs that their car may be affected, like a battery warning light on the dash board, or in more serious cases a 'small amount of smoke' seen coming from the engine bay. Earlier this month, Holden recalled the Korean-made Captiva after concerns that the SUV may lurch forward if the key was left in the ignition for too long. This brings Holden to a total of five recalls in the first four months of this year. Holden revealed that if the short circuit creates sufficient heat, there is a risk that the cable insulation may melt or potentially catch fire (Stock photo) This comes as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) announced figures that show the number of safety recalls in Australia are steadily on the rise. The ACCC monitored 307 recalls in 2014, a 14 per cent increase from 2013 where they only monitored 268 recalls. The figures show there has been a consistent increase in recalls dating back to 2010. Recalls the ACCC have monitored in Australia included a punching bag that contained nails and needles, a vacuum that put users at risk of electric shock and burns, an 'egg free' ice cream that contained egg whites and a spear gun that fired without warning. Senator Madigan, a former Democratic Labor Party representative told Farifax he blamed the rise in recalls on a 'systemic regulatory failure' to protect Australians from substandard imported products. 'There is definitely more faulty stuff around, but I do think that people are becoming a little bit more aware, and sick of it. There's a lot of these cheap places where you can go and buy cheap stuff, but it's not cheap if it doesn't last,' he warned.","Holden recalled 26,000 Colorado's as they are at risk of catching alight .

"A Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate is bidding to become Britain's first transgender MP. Zoe O'Connell lives in a three-way lesbian relationship with her two canvassers Sarah Brown and Sylvia Knight. The 37-year-old, who used to be a man, is standing for the Lib Dems in Maldon, Essex, and is using her complex personal life at the forefront of her campaign. Three way: Candidate Zoe O'Connell (left) used to be man, Sarah Brown (centre) used to be a man married to Sylvia Knight (right). They now all live together in a three-bedroom home in Cambridge . Her two lovers, Ms Brown, 41, and Ms Knight, 39, were once a straight married couple – when Ms Brown was a man. The two are now in a civil partnership. Miss O'Connell told the Mirror: 'We're content together…that is what matters to us. I'm running for office to change things. Twenty years ago this would never have happened. 'I'm standing up because I don't think anyone should be treated differently because of gender or sexuality or the way they choose to live…we live together. We're in a relationship and we're not ashamed of that.' When the former IT worker and father of three was a man, he split from his wife in 2005. Doubts about sexuality that he had as a child re-emerged and he realised he was a woman trapped in a man's body. Miss O'Connell met transsexual Ms Brown, a former computer technician, online later that year and struck up a friendship. After marrying when she was a man, Ms Brown's sex change had forced her to divorce Ms Knight – because the law then prevented marriage between two women. But the couple were still in a relationship and living together. Ms Brown eventually told Ms Knight about Miss O'Connell – and was amazed when her partner welcomed the idea of a three-way relationship. The women have lived in a three-bedroom home in Cambridge for the past seven years. The 37-year-old, who used to be a man, is standing for the Liberal Democrats in Maldon, Essex . Miss O'Connell was a bridesmaid when Ms Knight and Ms Brown took their vows for a second time in a civil partnership six years ago. The Lib Dem candidate said: 'It just works. There's more often someone there to be supportive. If one person's off doing something else then the other partner is still there…you can just keep each other company. It's given me strength since I underwent my transition.' She says her relationship with her children – an 11-year-old boy and two girls, 13 and 14 – is 'no different' to what it would be if she was still a divorced father. She spends weekends with them, but they call her 'Zoe' instead of 'Dad'. 'The kids were three, four and five when we separated,' she said, adding: 'Over the course of about four to six months I was spending more and more time in girl mode … They kind of gradually got used to it. 'There wasn't much in the way of verbal explanation. Since then I think they've just absorbed information via osmosis … it's normal for them.' Miss O'Connell met Ms Brown on an online forum. Ms Brown said: 'It took some time before we realised we had feelings for each other. 'Zoe was married at the time and going through a divorce … and we were only friends. But we were going through the same thing, speaking to the same people and comparing experiences. We were giving each other mutual support … and we were each there when the other went through surgery.' Miss O'Connell is standing in one of the Tories' safest seats, held by John Whittingdale – vice chairman of the Conservative backbenchers' 1922 committee – who had a 19,000 majority in the 2010 election.","Zoe O'Connell, 37, is bidding to become Britain's first transgender MP .

"She's won the London Marathon three times but this weekend Paula Radcliffe says she'll be happy to finish at all regardless of her position. The 41-year-old mother-of-two has battled back from injury to take part in the 26.2 mile race in the capital and a result won't be running with the other female elites but with the masses. She said this week: 'I'm going in unfit and unprepared for a marathon, but I'm hoping my body can remember once it gets out there how it's supposed to do it.' Scroll down for video . Paula Radcliffe finishes the London Marathon on Sunday after running with the masses to bring down the curtain on her professional running career . Paula was delighted she could return to London to run the marathon again . The mother-of-two has won the London Marathon three times, including in 2003 when she set her phenomenal word record time of 2 hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds . 'Unfit' for Paula actually means a time most runners can only dream of, and she's still likely to clock one of the fastest times of the day from a British woman. It will be an emotional run for Paula who will be presented with the the inaugural John Disley Lifetime Achievement award in honour of her achievements, which include setting a still unbeaten world record time of 2 hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds in London in 2003. Her great success over the years has also come with some heartache as she has never won an Olympic medal and often been let down by her body as she's pushed it to her limits. So as she prepares to run the marathon - supposedly for the last time - FEMAIL looks back on the career of the inspirational running super mother... Paula started running for Bedford and County from a young age, left, and won numerous races as a junior before progressing to take the European cross-country in 1998, right . The GB vests kept coming but she missed out on a medal at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 . Paula gave her all at the 2000 Olympics but was out-sprinted in the final moments and finished fourth . Paula's talent for running was evident from a young age and, under the coaching guidance of Alex Stanton at Bedford and County Athletics Club, she became accustomed to winning races on the domestic circuit. By the time she was a teenager, she had pulled on the first of her many Great Britain vests, winning junior races at the World Cross Country Championships and on the track. As a student at Loughborough University, she gained a first-class degree in modern languages while continuing to keep up her training regime. It was as student that she met her husband, Gary Lough - himself a talented middle distance runner - who went on to become her manager and training partner as well as the father of her two children. After leaving university, Paula embarked on her career as a full-time athlete and continued to have success in cross country races and on the track. She again lost out on a medal at the 2001 World Champs - which led to a public spat with husband Gary Lough who shared her disappointment . It was in Edmonton that Paula also made her stance on drugs in sport clear . But at major championships her valiant efforts to win a medal kept resulting in her getting out-sprinted in the home straight. She was fourth in the 5000m at the 1997 World Championships, fifth at the European Championships over 10,000m a year later and then fourth at the Sydney Olympic Games. At the World Championships in Edmonton in 2001 she was determined to make the podium - but after front-running she was again out-kicked in the final lap. This disappointment was her most famous as it led to a very public row with Gary - who criticised her race tactics when many thought he should have been consoling her. Gary was portrayed as a villain in the press - something that hurt the couple deeply. Success came on the track in 2002 as she won gold at the European Champs . She also took the gold in the 2002 Commonwealth Games 5k in front of a home crowd in Manchester . Her popularity soared as she was awarded an MBE in June 2002 and later that year was voted the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year, pictured here holding the coveted trophy . Speaking to the Evening Standard in 2012,  Paula said such heated arguments occur because: 'Gary understands what makes me tick and wants to support me as much as he can to achieve that. 'Sometimes that can cause blow ups - we are both strong-minded individuals but we have always said to each other that we should say what we want all the time. We never sleep on an argument because that is dangerous.' It was also in Edmonton that Paula made a public stand against drugs cheats holding up a banner saying 'EPO cheats out'. She's remained a staunch anti-drugs campaigner throughout her career and has called for tougher testing measures. Despite this, she's also had to face accusations that she couldn't have achieved her marathon World Record clean - as it's a time that hasn't been surpassed in 12 years. She said earlier this year she finds such unfounded accusations 'horrible'. 'I get it all the time. People saying ""she couldn't have run 2.15 clean"" but I know I can be totally proud,' she said. In 2003 she smashed the marathon world record as she won in London . In 2003 her form on the roads continued as she set also world records over 5k and 10k . But at the 2004 Athens Olympics, she was forced to drop out of the race despite being favourite to win . Paula was devastated she couldn't finish the Olympic marathon as her body was depleted by medication she had to take following a collision with a bike in training beforehand . The athlete felt she'd let everyone down and cried at the press conference . 'It makes you think we have to put a system in place that protects clean athletes. There will be some Russians athletes who are not cheating, there are a lot of Kenyan athletes out there who are not cheating and they are all being lumped together. It spoils it so we have to do something to protect them and the sport.' Paula bounced back from the disappointment in Edmonton to have a victorious year in 2002 over all terrain. She won the World Cross Country Championships and the London Marathon and finally took gold medals on the track at the Commonwealth Games and then the European Championships. She bounced back from the Olympic disappointment to take victory at the London Marathon again in 2005 . But the race will be remembered for the toilet stop she took en route . She also won a gold medal at the World Champs in 2005 over the marathon distance . Her popularity soared as she was awarded an MBE in June 2002 and later that year was voted the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year. In 2003 she ran her incredible world record marathon time pushing the pace from start to finish without another competitor in sight. She also set world records over 10k and 5k on the roads in the same year. As a result, in 2004 she went into the Athens Olympics marathon as the firm favourite and hopes were high that she would finally win the gold Olympic medal she deserved. But it was not to be. In training before the race, an collision with a cyclist led to an injury for which she had to take anti-inflammatory medication. The medicine depleted her system but she was determined to still race. However, her weakened body could not take the pace and she was forced to drop out of the race in tears. She later said the time that followed was 'traumatic' as she felt like she'd let the nation down and Gary admitted in ITV4's Sports Life Stories that the media attention almost led to him having 'a nervous breakdown'. The following year her success winning the London Marathon again was overshadowed by the fact she had to stop for a very public loo break on the side of the road. At the press conference afterwards, Paula laughed off the embarrassing incident explaining her need for the toilet was giving her stomach cramps and 'the main thing was to win the race'. Later that year, she won another gold medal in the World Championships over the marathon distance. Paula and Gary moved to Monaco and started a family as daughter Isla was born in January 2007. Less than a year later, Paula was back to winning ways taking victory at the New York Marathon. Daughter Isla was born in 2007 and months later, Paula won the New York marathon . But in 2008, she was disappointed to finish 23rd in the Beijing Olympics as her training was interrupted by injury in the build up. She's pictured here being consoled by friend and fellow GB runner Liz Yelling . Son Raphael was born in 2010 but injury again ruined her attempts to resume her running career . Once again she became an inspiration and proved to other elite female athletes that you can combine motherhood with a successful running career. In 2008, Paula lined up at the Olympics again but injury in the build-up to the race meant she missed vital training and she wasn't fit enough to compete with the best on the day. She finished in 23rd place and was once again upset she couldn't fulfill her potential at the Olympics. Later that year she won the New York marathon and then took another career break to have son Raphael. Since then, she returned to competitive running but was often thwarted by injury causing her to pull out of major competitions. In 2012, Paula had surgery on a long-standing foot problem in the hope it would mean she could run again . The surgery worked and Paula will now return to run the streets of London this weekend . The athlete said she's delighted to be back in the capital and Sunday's race will be 'really special' A foot problem meant running in the London 2012 Olympics was out of the question - in fact doctors were worried she may never run again. She kept up her interest in athletics becoming a commentator for the BBC and supporting grassroots running. Following surgery in 2012, she was relieved to be able to run again and is delighted she can now run the London Marathon again, albeit not at full fitness. She said of Sunday's race: 'I know I am not going to be competitive but to get the chance to take part in this race one more time is something that is really special.'","41-year-old mother-of-two has battled back from injury .

"A tiny oil painting that was kept in an attic for years and thought to be worth just £300 has now sold for more than £120,000 at auction. The oil painting - which measures nine inches by seven - of a Catholic saint was believed to be the work of a 'follower' of 16th century renaissance master El Greco. But the selling price suggests the untitled, undated and unsigned painting may actually have been done by the artist himself. Auctioneer Richard Bromell (pictured) gave the tiny painting an estimated value of about £300 to £400 but it ended up selling for more than £120,000 . It was acquired by the owner's late father in the 1970s for very little. He bought it because he believed it was a depiction of Saint Peter, who shares his name. And it was inherited by his son, who has not been named, who kept it in his loft for the past eight years before deciding to sell it following a clear-out. Auctioneer Richard Bromell, of Charterhouse Auctioneers of Sherborne, Dorset, gave the work an estimated value of between £300 and £400. But after advertising the sale, interest in the work took off. And feverish bidding, final hammer price was £98,000 and came to £120,932 with all the fees added on. Mr Bromell said: 'I rung the client after the sale and just told him it sold for ninety-eight. He asked 'what pounds?' And I told him it was £98,000. 'He said he needed to sit down. When he came down off the ceiling he was very, very pleased. I think if he had been offered £500 for it before the auction he would have snapped your hand off.' The oil painting (right) was believed to have been the work of a follower of 16th century renaissance master El Greco (left) but the selling price suggests it may have been done by the artist himself . Mr Bromell explained it was very difficult to judge the painting. He said: 'We described it as by a follower of El Greco because that is what it looked like and I still think that to be the case. 'It was a very interesting picture and very hard to value. 'If you asked three people the question 'how much is it worth?' you would get three different answers. One reputable gallery stopped bidding at £10,000 because that was how much they were prepared to pay for it. 'Obviously as least two people thought it was worth the money because the bidding just went up and up. 'We must have advertised it well because all the right people attended the sale. On the day of the sale I thought it might go for a few thousand pounds so we were obviously delighted with the outcome. 'People play their cards very close to their chest at these things and the person who bought it came in and was only interested in this item and nothing else.'","Auctioneer gave painting an estimated value of between £300 and £400 .

"Shops are full of red dresses this year, so should you be tempted to trade in your LBD for an LRD? It’s a colour that radiates energy and sexiness, but that can all be wrecked if the style doesn’t suit you. We asked Kate Battersby to try six looks to see which work — and which absolutely don’t. Scroll down for video . I LOOK SO OLD IN THIS! Dress, £270, Gina Bacconi at johnlewis.com . Shoes, £485, biondacastana.com . Lace may be back in fashion, but to me it’s unfailingly ageing. The unattractive shade of orangey-red is made worse by the colour of the underslip — a queasy pale peach. Its weight suggests that it’s reinforced concrete and while thick fabric can smooth problem areas, here it bulges at the waist. The shallow V-neck doesn’t enhance my bust, the sash creates matronliness and the asymmetric lace around the neckline looks torn. 0/5 . IT COULD BE DESIGNER .

The ruched style is reminiscent of Herve Leger’s famous bandage dresses, insofar as the fabric stretches to flatter just where it’s needed.

"Forget about the 'theory of everything', an even more important question has been put to Professor Stephen Hawking - What do you think is the cosmological effect of Zayn Malik leaving One Direction? The legendary physicist was speaking at the Sydney Opera House as a 3D hologram from his physical location at Cambridge University in the UK, when the question was put to him. But it was a subject that Professor Hawking had his own theory on saying: 'Finally, a question about something important.' Scroll down for video . Professor Stephen Hawking appeared at the Sydney Opera House on Saturday night as a 3D hologram from his physical location at Cambridge University in the UK . During the show Professor Hawking was asked about the cosmological effect of former One Direction singer Zayn Malik leaving the boy band . Buzzfeed reports that a questioner asked: 'What do you think is the cosmological effect of Zayn leaving One Direction and consequently breaking the hearts of millions of teenage girls across the world?' But he happily tackled the conundrum and came up with an explanation that would satisfy every One Direction fan. 'My advice to any heartbroken young girl is to pay close attention to the study of theoretical physics. Because one day there may well be proof of multiple universes,' he said. Professor Hawking showed as well as a huge intellect he possesses a good sense of humour . When Zayn left One Direction he broke the hearts of millions of teenage girls . Professor Hawking joked that in another different universe 'Zayn is still in One Direction' 'It would not be beyond the realms of possibility that somewhere outside of our own universe lies another different universe. 'And in that universe, Zayn is still in One Direction.' It got better still for the questioner as Professor Hawking went on to add that, 'this girl may like to know that in another possible universe, she and Zayn are happily married'. The legendary physicist also spoke about the mysteries of the universe, being diagnosed with ALS, and the future of our planet . Apart from the cosmic effect caused by Zayn leaving One Direction, Professor Hawking spoke about the mysteries of the universe, being diagnosed with ALS, and the future of our planet. And if the future of mankind was to prosper then we had to look to the stars. 'We must also continue to go into space for the future of humanity. I don’t think we will survive another 1,000 years without escaping beyond our fragile planet,' Hawking said.","The legendary physicist was speaking at the Sydney Opera House .

"A leading holiday company has cancelled trips out to Nepal following in the wake of the 7.8 magnitude earth quake that struck the country leaving thousands dead. Intrepid Travel, who run 800 trips across the world and have 100,000 customers each year, have decided not to take any more bookings to Nepal until May 11. And those who are planning on travelling out before this date with existing bookings have been offered a full refund or alternative trip. Scroll down for video . As the search goes on for those missing in the earthquake, the British Foreign Office has advised tourists in Nepal to follow the advice from local authorities . The company confirmed to MailOnline Travel that their 200 clients who are currently in the country have all been accounted for and are safe. 'While we are continuing to concentrate on the safety of our clients out in Nepal, we have decided to cancel all our trips to the country until May 11 while the rescue operation is underway,' said a spokesperson. 'Safety is our main priority, and even after this date, we may have to recommend our customers to book to visit somewhere else. 'No-one knows how long the rescue operation will go on for, but in the short term we wouldn't advise anyone to visit after such a disaster.' Intrepid Group has been running tours to Nepal for 36 years and has a team of local operators on the ground constantly monitoring the situation. Nepal’s capital Kathmandu – with a population of over one million – was one of the worst-hit areas in Nepal, with the quake’s epicentre just 50 miles north of the city. As the tremors intensified, people were seen in scenes of mayhem running from their homes and places of work in panic. Dozens of people were gathered in the car park of Kathmandu's Norvic International Hospital, where thin mattresses had been spread on the ground for patients rushed outside, some patients wearing hospital pyjamas, while doctors and nurses were treating people. Around 1,000 tourists have amassed at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu in the hope of getting out of Nepal following the earthquake . Jordan Torrilla, Nepal expert with luxury holiday company Kuoni has warned tourists what they should expect if they honour their trips to the Asian country. 'As with any aftermath of a natural disaster, there will be a frenzy, and it certainly won't be calm and tranquil',' he told MailOnline Travel. 'There will be an atmosphere of worry, people will be doing emergency shopping, and obviously it wouldn't be a great time to be going out there. 'There are always times when people have to travel out to these destinations after a disaster, tourists just have to be aware of the people and what they will be going through. 'You are certainly not going to be number one, not going to be the priority. It's important you have a deep level of patience as it will be very difficult for the local to prioritise you when they may be dealing with severe family issues and loss of life.' And a spokesperson for Trailfinders confirmed that their customers scheduled to travel to Nepal in the next couple of days have been contacted and advised against making the trip. All 12 bookings they have out in Nepal have been accounted for and plans are being made to return them home. People survey the rubble of damaged buildings a day after a massive earthquake in Nepal . Meanwhile the Foreign Office advice is that British tourists should check with their travel provider before heading to Nepal. The importance of following local authorities' advice as well as keeping an eye on news and updates has also been highlighted as critical for anyone who may have been caught up in the disaster. And the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) told MailOnline Travel that tourists should be aware that Nepal is always considered a country of 'high-risk' of earthquake, and that their main focus is on helping Britons caught up in the disaster. 'We advise people to stay in a place of safety and follow any advice provided by local authorities,' a spokesperson said. 'The situation is always changing, so it's important to keep an eye on local news providers. 'Our general advice to anyone who is set to travel, or currently travelling, out there would be to check with your travel provider, and to make sure you keep abreast of the situation. 'We have a dedicated phone number that people can call if they have any questions at all about the situation, and this can be about outward travel too.' The earthquake's epicentre was Kathmandu, but aftershocks and tremors have been felt in another three countries . The United States Geological Survey said the quake struck 81 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 06.11 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside of their homes. The 7.8 magnitude tremor was the worst to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years. Television footage showed a huge swathe of houses had collapsed in while roads had been split in two by the force of the impact. Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu has re-opened following the disaster, but with over a thousand people queuing overnight, the journey out of Nepal will be problematic for tourists. NDTV reports that a queue 'perhaps a kilometre long' has grown outside Nepal's only international airport, with many families having to go without food and water in the hope of leaving the country. A statement on the FCO website reads: 'The British Embassy would seek to help British nationals to leave as soon as possible following a major natural disaster. Around 2,000 people are thought to have died in Nepal alone, with hundred still missing . 'However, Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) may be unusable following a large-scale earthquake, as will Nepal’s road network. It could take some days for it to become operational.' A spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) told MailOnline Travel: 'Travellers in Nepal are advised to monitor local news and media reports and to follow any advice and instructions issued by the authorities and by the Foreign Office. 'ABTA works closely with its Members and with the Foreign Office to ensure the safety of any customers and staff affected. 'British travellers in Nepal or those due to travel should contact their holiday company who will help them with any concerns.' Nepalese rescue members and onlookers gather at the collapsed Darahara Tower in Kathmandu; tourists are now making their way to Tribhuvan International Airport in the hope of avoiding another disaster . Around 40,000 British Nationals are reported to have visited Nepal in 2013. Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond has said his thoughts are with everyone who has been affected by the natural disaster, and that the British government are in 'close contact' with their Nepalese counterparts. 'The British Embassy in Nepal is offering our assistance to the authorities and is providing consular assistance to British Nationals,' he added. This morning, a 6.7 magnitude aftershock struck India and Nepal, shaking buildings in New Delhi and triggering an avalanche in the Himalayas. The earthquake also triggered a massive avalanche on Mount Everest killing 18 people and injuring at least 30 climbers. There are also a number of climbers still missing, including a number of Britons. If you are a British national currently in Nepal and wish to inform the FCO of your whereabouts you should contact them on  +44 207 008 0000. This number can also be called for anybody who has concerns about visiting the region affected by the earthquake.","Intrepid Travel cancels all trips to Nepal until at least May 11 .

"An Ohio woman was shocked this month when an officer cited her for leaving her dog in a hot car but, instead of writing a ticket, the cop forced her to sit inside to see how it feels. The Strongsville pet owner was inside a Walmart as the dog sat in the parking lot. The officer then had the woman sit inside with the windows up and ignition off. And this isn't the first time an animal-loving officer has employed the unorthodox punishment. In the recent Ohio incident, the woman was left 'looking uncomfortable' as she sat in her unventilated Nissan Sentra, but drove away with just a warning and her tail between her legs. Scroll down for video . Unorthodox: A cop ordered a woman in this Ohio shopping center to sit in her hot car this month after officers discovered her dog locked inside her Nissan Sentra as she shopped in Walmart . In Truth or Consequences, New Mexico last June, the pet owner in question wasn't as eager to put the incident behind her. Shelly Nicholas filed a report against an officer who told her to sit in her car after someone called to report a dog was inside with no ventilation in 90 degree heat. Nicholas reasoned that she'd only been away ten minutes. 'You can wait in the truck and close the door you know, since it's not that hot,' the officer is heard saying to Nicholas in body camera footage later obtained by KOB. However, in her report, Nicholas characterizes the officers words as an 'order' and the footage does not show her actually sitting in the hot car as police wrote her a ticket. Sweating it out: Last year, Shelly Nicholas in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico was told to sit in her hot car after her dog was found locked inside with no ventilation. She filed a report against the officers, but body cam footage later revealed it was more of a request than an order . Declined to do it: Nicholas declined to sit in the the hot car with the door closed in spite of the officer's request . While this may not be a legitimate police practice, officers have reason for concern in these situations, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. While Nicholas argued she'd only been gone 10 minutes, the AVMA says that temperatures can rise 20F inside a car in that short amount of time. In 20 minutes, the temperature can rise by nearly 30 degrees. Even on a 70F day, writes the AVMA, the interior of a car can reach 110F after one hour. Even short periods in such heat can cause heat stroke and irreversible organ damage in your dog. h/t Huffington Post .","A woman at an Ohio Walmart says an officer forced her to sit in her car after she left her dog sitting in the parking lot April 12 .

"Police in Arizona may be one step closer to solving a 15-year-old cold case murder of a Tucson mother and the subsequent related slayings of her mother and neighbor. David Duane Watson, a 46-year-old Tucson firefighter, was arrested without incident Saturday on charges he killed his ex-wife Linda Watson, 35, in what detectives say motivated by a custody dispute over their daughter. Police say the dispute continued after Watson's murder as her mother Marilyn Cox, 63, tried to obtain visitation rights. Three years after her daughter went missing, Cox and her neighbor Renee Farnsworth, 53, were shot dead in the driveway of Linda Watson's home. Tragic: Police say Linda Watson, left, was killed by her ex-husband David Watson during a 2000 custody dispute over their daughter Jordynn, right. Three years later, they say Mr. Watson murdered Linda's mother Marilyn Cox, center, as she tried to gain visitation rights over the girl in 2003 . Cold case closed? Seen here upon his arrest late Saturday, David Watson has been charged in the murder of his ex-wife, ex mother-in-law and an innocent neighbor . Police said at a press conference on Saturday that Mr. Watson had been the prime suspect in the murders from the start, reports the Arizona Daily Star. Watson has been charged in all three homicides, with police cited DNA evidence. Chief Deputy Chris Nanos said sheriffs never gave up on the cases, writes Tucson News Now. 'It just goes to show you that the men and women of this department are bulldogs,' said Nanos. 'We'll keep tracking you, we'll find you and you will get punished for the crimes you do.' Linda Watson was reported missing in August 2000 after she failed to pick up her daughter from the home of David Watson. She was last seen by a friend who'd dropped her off following a church function. Inside the home were found Ms. Watson's pager, Bible and purse. The door to her home was found open and her blood was discovered at the scene. Linda Watson was reported missing in August 2000 after she failed to pick up her daughter from the home of David Watson. She was last seen by a friend who dropped her off at her Tucson home after church. Her body would not be found until 2012 . Police say David Watson had been the primary suspect since 2000, but have only now tied him to the crime with what a Sheriff's Department official said Saturday was 'DNA evidence' After her disappearance, Marilyn Cox, became intent on finding her daughter and devoted her life to the search. She--along with the girl's paternal grandfather--was granted visitation rights for her granddaughter. However, Cox said at the time that Watson obstructed those rights, so she petitioned for a review. In May 2003, with another custody battle heating up, Cox was shot dead in a drive-by shooting in the driveway of the home from which her daughter had disappeared years before. Her neighbor, Renee Farnsworth, was also killed in the shooting. Meanwhile. Linda would not officially be declared dead until 2006. Her body wouldn't be found until six years after that when remains discovered in the Arizona desert turned out to be hers. Watson was scheduled to be arraigned Sunday morning at Pima County jail where the Sheriff's Department would recommend a $ million bond, reports KGUN.

"This is the moment a young orphaned chimp was rescued after she was found in a tiny wooden box cowering from the animal traffickers who killed her mother. The illegal animal traders had kept the terrified three-year-old in the box for two weeks. And the men had been trying to find a buyer on the lucrative black market when they were stopped at a check point trying to cross into Sierra Leone from Guinea, in west Africa, last week. Scroll down for video . This orphaned chimp was found cowering in a tiny box terrified of the animal traffickers who killed her mother . The traffickers were caught during a joint operation by the Guinea Ministry of Environment, the Gendarmerie and the Guinée-Application de la Loi Faunique (GALF) project. Charlotte Houpline, director of French wildlife protection group WARA, said many traffickers have already been arrested and sentenced in Guinea sine they launched the project. She said: 'Slowly the change that is needed is happening. We have been supporting the Government of Guinea for four years now to strengthen law enforcement. Facilitating the arrest and conviction of wildlife traffickers is the main part of our work. 'And we want to target mainly the major traffickers to tackle head-on its major obstacle - corruption.' She added that Guinea, as well as all the other African countries home to great apes, have a low rate of prosecution for animal trafficking. The traffickers, who kept the three-year-old alive with food (pictured) had been trying to find a buyer for her . A spokeswoman for Eco Activists for Governance and Law Enforcement, said: 'The three-year old female who was saved last Saturday was the lucky one. 'She could very easily have ended in the house of some wealthy foreigner or even in an official zoo, travelling out of the country with false documents. 'But even more probably she might not even survive, as the estimations are that for one young ape, smuggled out of Africa, 10 others die on the way, as the traffickers are not able to provide them with proper care. 'Other horrific numbers are unknown - the babies, which are detected and in best case seized, like this our one, present only a minority of all poached and sold ape babies. 'By easy calculation, we can estimate the number of chimpanzees lost only in Guinea during last years to reach tens of thousands. The illegal animal traders had kept the terrified three-year-old chimpanzee in the box for two weeks . 'And hundreds of thousands in the all sub-Saharan Africa. This crime will drive the chimpanzees in wild to the extinction within few decades, if it is not stopped. 'Little apes are like human children. To survive, they need not only food, they need love and care. Trauma, which they experience when they see their mother and their family being killed, is not easy to forget. 'When their family is attacked and mother killed, they cannot do anything else than cling to her. And then they are torn away from mother´s still warm body by the same men who killed her, falling easily into depression and deprivation. 'Yet the future of this particular female looks brighter. She was not seriously injured nor fatally traumatised. Immediately after rescue she was accepted by a sanctuary that takes care of orphaned chimpanzees who survived the slaughter of their families. 'There she has a second chance, starting with a long process of rehabilitation to overcome the traumas they suffered and hoping to one day be back to the wild.' Chimpanzees are the closest genetic living relatives to humans - and their young take years to mature. They were stopped at a check point trying to cross into Sierra Leone from Guinea, in West Africa, last week . The country is a hub of wildlife trafficking internationally where apes, ivory, skins, reptiles, parrots, shark fins and manatees are illegally exported by organised crime syndicates. Since 2007, more than 130 chimpanzees and 10 gorillas were exported from Guinea to China with valid CITES permits, which classified these animals as having been bred in captivity - despite no captive breeding programmes existing in Guinea. According to UN Great Apes Survival Partnership (GRASP) the poachers have to kill approximately 10 chimpanzees to get one baby. So for 130 chimps, exported out of the country, 1,300 of their family members were slaughtered.. One year ago GALF, the Guinea Conakry branch of WARA provided information which lead to the arrest of one of the most notorious ape traffickers in Guinea, Ousmane Diallo. He was sentenced to a year in prison in July 2013 following an 18 month meticulous investigation by GALF. During the investigations, he boasted on video that he had trafficked more than 500 chimpanzees, a live lion and panthers.","Animal traders had kept terrified three-year-old in the box for two weeks .

"When George Clooney tied the knot with British lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014, they chose Venice as the place to get married. And no wonder, this stunning city of marble palaces, ancient churches, canals and waterways is a magnet for those in love. Come May, lovers of art will be flocking to the city too as it plays host to its Biennale Art Festival, an exhibition when over 88 nations showcase their country's best works of art in national pavilions dotted throughout the city. So if you're heading there then, get a taste of 'la Dolce Vita' Clooney-style by taking in some of the places the couple made their own and the beautiful scenery that provided the backdrops for their wedding celebrations. Scroll down for video . The Belmond Hotel Cipriani is on the island of Giudecca, just a few minutes by water taxi from Saint Mark’s Square. The views from its restaurant are magnificent . George and Amal's wedding celebrations lasted over the course of a whole weekend and were at some of Venice's most exclusive venues . Where to stay: George's favourite hotel . George loves the Belmond Hotel Cipriani. It was here that both he and Amal, as well as many of their celebrity friends, based themselves during the wedding weekend. Guests at the hotel can try two special cocktails that George created with head barman Walter Bolzonella – ‘Nina’s Passion’ (named after Clooney’s mother) and ‘Buonanotte’ (Italian for 'Good Night' in honour of Clooney’s film Good Night, Good Luck). The hotel is on the island of Giudecca, a sliver of land just 300 metres wide and 1.5miles in length, but its views of some of Venice's most famous landmarks like St Mark's Square and the Doge's Palace are spectacular. The Belmond Hotel Cipriani has double garden view rooms starting from £477 per night, including breakfast and taxes . The hotel's heated swimming pool, set in extensive gardens, is filled with heated seawater and is the only hotel pool in central Venice . Where to eat: The Stag Party restaurant . Clooney kicked the celebrations off with a stag do at one of his favourite eateries in the city, a traditional-style restaurant called Da Ivo, serving food from Northern Italy. George – a regular patron – is believed to have given manager pal Giovanni Fracassi just ten minutes’ notice prior to turning up with his stag party friends, among them former supermodel Cindy Crawford’s husband Rande Gerber. The groom ordered five courses followed by two puddings. His party also worked their way through dishes including antipasto and pasta with truffles during their stay at the restaurant, after which a satisfied George personally thanked resident chef Giorgina Mazzero. The bill is believed to have been around £3,000 but was waived by manager Giovanni Fracassi. George Clooney leaving the Belmond Hotel Cipriani (left) on his way by watertaxi to Ristorante Ivo (right), where he held his stag party . Rande Gerber had also brought several bottles of tequila, which the group enjoyed after their dinner at the exclusive eatery. Producing partner Grant Heslov was also there along with several other of his male companions. Where to soak up the romance: The wedding hotel . George and Amal chose to have their celebrations before they signed the papers to be officially wed. Guests included Cindy Crawford, Bill Murray, Emily Blunt and Matt Damon, U2 lead singer Bono and US Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour. And they couldn't have chosen a better venue, Venice's only 'seven star' hotel, the super swanky Aman Canal Grande. Located on the Grand Canal and offering glorious views across the city, the hotel has rooms bedecked with historic frescoes and hallways that ooze opulence with hand-crafted chandeliers made on the nearby island of Murano, . It was opened in the 450-year-old Palazzo Papadopoli in 2013 and offers rooms starting in price from an eye-watering €850 (£609) per night, excluding tax and service, but including airport transfers by boat. If you want to really get in the romantic mood, you could book out the suite where the Clooneys stayed on their wedding night... but it will set you back an eye-watering £3,000. The Aman Canal Grande Venice is located just opposite the Cavalli Palace where George and Amal tied in the knot in their official ceremony . The lavishly-painted Piano Nobile Lounge was the setting for much of George and Amal's evening wedding festivities . The palace in which the Aman Canal Grande is housed was built in 1550 for a wealthy Venetian family of traders and seafarers . Where to wed: The 16th-century registry office . The final stage in the Clooneys' whirlwind wedding tour of Venice was when they made it all legal in the official ceremony at a Venetian registry office. They an had a choice of three venues - Cavalli Palace, Cà Farsetti, and Cà Vendramin Calergi. In the end George and Amal chose the Cavalli Palace, a 16th-century Renaissance building in the heart of the city opposite the Aman Canal Grande and close to the famous Rialto Bridge. Its light-filled hall overlooking the Grand Canal makes it a favourite choice for couples getting married. Couples from all over the world flock to Venice to get hitched. Prices for an official ceremony start from €400 (£286) for EU citizens and €1,600 (£1,150) for those from outside the European Union. The bride and groom left on a vaporetto (water taxi) appropriately called 'Amore' accompanied by a flotilla of boats bobbing down the Grand Canal, looking like for all the world like a modern-day version of a painting by Canaletto.

Mr Cameron, pictured making the gaffe in a speech in South London, said he had been 'overcome by something', adding: 'I don't know what happened to me, it was just one of those things' The Prime Minister said he had been 'overcome by something', adding: 'I don't know what happened to me, it was just one of those things.' He said he had gone 'off script' with the remark adding: 'I suppose it's just the campaign. By the time you have made as many speeches as I have on this campaign all sorts of funny things start popping out of your mouth.' Mr Cameron likened himself to the Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, who infamously blamed a 'brain fade' after a disastrous interview. He said: 'I had what Natalie would describe as a brain fade – I don't know what happened to me. I think I was overcome by something. But these things sometimes happen when you're on the stump.' Labour said the gaffe exposed the Prime Minister as a 'phoney'. Former Downing Street spin chief Alastair Campbell claimed it 'says a lot about his character', adding: 'Out of touch. Phoney.

In fact, the Prime Minister's late uncle Sir William Dugdale was Aston Villa's chairman from 1975 to 1982. In the final year of his chairmanship, Villa beat the odds to win the European Cup. Mr Cameron said he remembered the glory days back in the early 80s'. He said the star players Andy Gray and Brian Little 'got me going'. But Mr Cameron, interviewed by Sky News host Dermot Murnaghan, said: 'My uncle was involved in the club and back in the early 80s and all those successes - Andy Gray and Brian Little got me going. 'I don't go very often - in fact I haven't been for years and years - but I do try to keep up. We're going to escape the relegation zone, which we're out of now - and the cup final is very exciting.' Mr Cameron's late uncle Sir William Dugdale was Aston Villa's chairman from 1975 to 1982. Reminded of his comment in 2001 in the House of Commons that he wasn't actually a football fan, Mr Cameron said: 'I mean, I'm not a regular attender, I used to play football as a kid, my son plays football, and I try and sort of keep up with what's happening in the Premier League and see how Villa are doing. 'But when they get snug in the middle of the table I tend to sort of, I tend to back off a bit. When we get close to the bottom I get nervous, but I don't know what happened.' Mr Cameron was asked to show his support for Aston Villa by naming the year of the club's famous European Cup final victory in 1982. The PM said: 'It was early 80s, I'm not going to give you a date because I'll get it wrong.' He added: 'I'm not doing quiz time because I will get them all wrong.' Mr Cameron made the gaffe in a speech on multiculturalism in the UK – claiming it was possible to support a number of teams at the same time and still be British. He said: 'You can support Man United, the Windies and Team GB all at the same time.' But he then added: 'Of course I'd rather you supported West Ham.' Speaking on the Murnaghan programme broadcast this morning, Mr Cameron tried to explain away the gaffe. He said: 'I've been an Aston Villa fan all my life, I literally opened my mouth and I was going off-piste about the fact that in Britain you can be a supporter of the West Indies, a supporter of Manchester United, and a supporter of Team GB.'","David Cameron appeared to forget which football team he supported .

"Nicola Sturgeon this afternoon scoffed at claims by Labour leader Ed Miliband that he would never do a deal with the SNP to become Prime Minister - insisting he will 'change his tune' after the election. The Scottish First Minister said Mr Miliband simply 'won't have the votes to say that he is going to do what he likes come what may' and reiterated her call for Labour to 'work together to lock the Tories out'. It came after Mr Miliband this morning repeatedly insisted he would not enter into any deal with the SNP after the election - either as a formal Coalition or a looser pact to put him in Number 10. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband and his wife Justine meet Hindu devotees at the Shree Swaminarayan Temple in Willesden Green, London today . The Labour leader's visit to the north London temple came after he told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show he would not do any deals with the SNP . But Ms Sturgeon said 'I suspect Ed Miliband will change his tune once the votes are cast..' Labour is expected to suffer heavy losses in Scotland - where it won 41 seats in 2010 - with forecasts suggesting Ms Sturgeon's party could see as many as 50 MPs elected. The latest set of UK-wide polls indicate that the General Election race is still neck-and-neck, with the country heading for a probable hung parliament and coalition negotiations after May 7. Pressed on whether he would consider a confidence-and-supply deal with the SNP to ensure backing for a Queen's Speech and Budget if he failed to secure an overall majority, Mr Miliband said: 'I am not interested in deals, no.' The Labour leader told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'If it is a Labour government it will be a Labour Queen's Speech, it will be a Labour Budget. It will not be written by the SNP.' But Ms Sturgeon told Sky News: 'On May 8 once the votes are cast, once the people have cast their verdict, Ed Miliband, just like the rest of us, will have to respect the wishes of the people in a democratic election.

'If there is a minority government, if no party has an overall majority, then it's simply not possible to ignore the views of other parties - I know that, I was part of a minority government at the Scottish Parliament. 'So if the SNP has a large number of MPs, firstly we can use that clout to keep the Tories out, and secondly we can use it to ensure the Tories are replaced with something better, bolder and more progressive. 'If that remains the case on May 8 if he doesn't have a majority, what he will be saying to the people is rather than work with the SNP if there is an anti-Tory majority, he'd rather watch David Cameron waltz back into Downing Street. 'I don't want that and the SNP will use our votes to stop a Tory government getting off the ground if there is that anti-Tory majority.' Ms Sturgeon added: 'It's the people who are in charge and the politicians have to respect the democratic wishes of the people, if Ed Miliband doesn't get a majority, as the polls are all saying he won't, then he'll have to work with other parties.'

Mr Cameron said he made 'no apology' for focussing on the threat posed by the SNP in the election next month . The latest opinion poll in Scotland shows Labour remains on course for heavy losses to the Scottish nationalists in its heartlands north of the border - keeping hold of as few as five seats. Just over a quarter  of Scots say they will be voting for Labour in the election, according to the Panelbase poll for The Sunday Times, down two on earlier in the month, with the SNP up three points to stand at 48 per cent. With the election now less than two weeks away, the Prime Minister and other leading Tories have stepped up their attacks on the SNP. David Cameron warned voters that they have '11 days to save Britain' as he claimed Scottish nationalists 'don't want the country to succeed'. In an escalation of his rhetoric about the dangers of the May 7 General Election producing a minority Labour government propped up by the Scottish National Party, he told the Sunday Express that nationalist MPs would be hoping for a 'disaster' which would bring forward their dream of independence. Meanwhile, Conservative Home Secretary Theresa May told the Mail on Sunday that a Labour/SNP government could be 'the biggest constitutional crisis since the abdication', when King Edward VIII gave up the throne in 1936. Ms Sturgeon said: 'Theresa May has made herself look completely and utterly stupid with ridiculous over the top comments like that. 'This is the same Theresa May that tried to tell the people of Scotland during the referendum campaign that if we voted Yes we would lose our passports and have border controls. 'People will look at these silly comments, and I was going to say they will treat them with contempt, but that actually attaches too much seriousness to them. People will just laugh at her.'","Scottish First Minister said Mr Miliband simply 'won't have the votes'

"A British couple face being stranded in Spain for at least three months after their baby boy was born 12 weeks prematurely during a family holiday. Karla Hornby said she thought she was going to die when she gave birth to baby Freddie, weighing just 2lbs, by emergency caesarean section while on holiday in Benidorm with her partner Jordan Jackson. The couple have now been told they will have to stay in Spain for at least three months while Freddie builds up his strength. But Mr Jackson, 21, a soldier in the army's Royal Logistics corps, who has served in Afghanistan, is meant to report back for service tomorrow. Stranded: Karla Hornby and Jordan Jackson are facing the prospect of spending three months in Spain while their baby boy Freddie builds up his strength. Ms Hornby also has a daughter Charlie, seven (pictured) Premature: Freddie weighed just 2lbs after being born by emergency caesarean section while on holiday in Benidorm. His mother has spoken of her surprise after suddenly going into labour 12 weeks prematurely . The pair had travelled to the Spanish resort for a final relaxing break before Ms Hornby was due to give birth in three months' time. Ms Hornby, who is already a mum to seven-year-old Charlie, had been cleared to fly by medical staff but was given a surprise when she suddenly went into labour. The 29-year-old said: 'On Saturday we were relaxing by the pool when my waters suddenly broke - I was in complete and utter shock.' She was taken to hospital, where doctors found that she was already 2cm dilated and transferred her to a bigger hospital. 'Jordan wasn't allowed in the ambulance with me and the staff didn't speak any English so I had no idea what was going on - my contractions were getting stronger,' Ms Hornby added. Costly trip: Freddie's family from Bolton, Greater Manchester, have so far been able to use insurance to pay for medical costs but they are now facing the prospect of supporting themselves in Spain for three months . Shocked: Ms Hornby thought she was going to die when she gave birth three months prematurely . 'In hospital I was bleeding heavily - it was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. 'I had one big contraction and bled heavily, so they rushed me to theatre - I was shaking and I couldn't breathe, I thought I was going to die.' An emergency c-section was performed but the couple weren't able to see Freddie until the following evening. She said: 'I couldn't stop crying, I was so relieved that he was OK but he just looked so small - I was desperate to pick him up.' The family from Bolton, Greater Manchester, have been able to use insurance to pay for medical costs but have already had to pay £1,000 for a hotel. They are now facing the prospect of supporting themselves in Spain for at least three months as Freddie gains the strength needed to fly home. Their family and friends are doing everything they can to raise money to help and a funding website has already raised more than £900. Mr Jackson's mother, Vickie Cunliffe, said: 'It has been so frightening for everyone - we are just trying to think of as many ways as possible to raise money to help them.' Ms Hornby's best friend Lisa Johnston said: 'We just want as many people as possible to get in touch and do what they can to help them survive over there.'

Earlier this year fellow British couple Katie Amos, 30, and fiancé Lee Johnston, 29, got stuck in New York with a £130,000 medical bill after their baby son was born 11 weeks prematurely while they were on a four-day getaway. The couple welcomed son Dax unexpectedly after Ms Amos went into labour while sightseeing in the Big Apple. The pair, whose son weighed just 3lbs, were told by doctors the newborn was not able to fly back to the family home in Burgh-le-Marsh, Lincolnshire, until March. American doctors said the pair's medical bills would reach £130,000 ($200,000), leaving the couple stranded overseas with limited clothes and money.","Karla Hornby, 29, gave birth 12 weeks prematurely on holiday in Benidorm .

"Shocking footage has emerged of the terrifying moment two people stood in a tiny dinghy while a six metre great white shark charged them. A film crew shooting the documentary Lair of the Megashark were just off New Zealand's Stewart Island when they attempted to put a camera on the dorsal fin of the massive ocean predator who decided to nudge the boat and bite at the thin rope that tethered the dinghy to the main boat. The two men that can be seen on the boat are shark experts Jeff Kurr and Andy Casagrande. They can be seen panicking as the great white uses it's strong jaws and tail to shake the boat, causing it to sway dangerously. A film crew shooting the documentary Lair of the Megashark were just off New Zealand's Stewart Island when they attempted to put a camera on the dorsal fin of the massive ocean predator . The shark disappears for a few moments while the crew regroups, however, they are stunned a second time when it resurfaces dangerously close to the dinghy, as it tries to get a hold of the bait attached to the main rig. One of the men described the experience as 'a bit nerve racking' while another man can be heard saying: 'I don't think this is such a brilliant f*****g idea you know'. Another shark is spotted breaching near the small boat before the crew decide it is too unsafe to have a boat of that size in the water, while such large predators are in the area. One man can be heard warnning that while sharks are 'not malicious', they do 'kill things for a living'. The documentary Lair of the Megashark was screened on the Discovery Channel last year during Shark Week. Images of the footage have been posted online by groups who want to ban shark diving as they think it's causing sharks to associate humans and boats with food.

Images of the footage have been posted online by groups who want to ban shark diving as they think it's causing sharks to associate humans and boats with food. Fisherman Richard Squires told the New Zealand Herald he had faced two similar attacks and is confident that the reason sharks are becoming more comfortable around boats is cage-diving. 'A shark came up and bit a buoy on the stern of the vessel, it came charging out of the water with its mouth open,' he said. Last year the Department of Conservation only granted permits to two cage diving operators under the condition that they observe strict regulations around feeding and using decoys. They are also only authorised to operate at Edwards Island, around 10 kilometers off the coast of New Zealand's Stewart Island.

New Zealand MP Clayton Mitchell is calling for the activity to be prohibited until a comprehensive study into the impact of cage diving is completed. 'When you start bringing the sharks in close to your boat for the thrill-seekers, like any animal their behaviour becomes modified,' he said in a public meeting about the shark problem. Experts, on the other hand, are certain cage diving has nothing to do with the increased great white activity. The Department of Conservation's director of conservation services, Allan Munn, said it is 'highly unlikely' shark diving would change the behaviour of sharks in the area.

"The Aurora movie theater shooter studied brain disorders as a doctoral student before he killed 12 people and injured 70 more in one of America's deadliest mass shootings. Prosecutors said James Holmes, 27, was once a sought-after neuroscientist-in-training, but evidence shows that months before the shooting he was preparing for violence. The prosecution is trying to prove that Holmes was not mentally ill and knew exactly what he was doing the night of July 20, 2012, when he opened fire during the midnight premiere of the Batman film 'The Dark Knight Rises'. If the 12 final jurors, chosen from a pool of 9,000, decide that Holmes was mentally ill at the time of the shooting, he will be committed indefinitely to a state psychiatric hospital. If not, prosecutors will press for the death penalty over life in prison without parole. Aurora movie theater shooter James Holmes studied brain disorders as a doctoral student before he killed 12 people and injured 70 more in one of America's deadliest mass shootings . Prosecutors said, in the months before the shooting, Holmes told a classmate he wanted to kill people, had fallen out of favor with his professors, and had stopped seeing his psychiatrist. He then sent her threatening text messages and mailed her his journal in a package with $20 bills, prompting her to alert University of Colorado campus police. Holmes also stockpiled weapons, ammunition, tear gas grenades and riot gear, and rigged his apartment to become a potentially lethal booby trap, cranking techno music in an apparent attempt to lure someone into opening his door. One neighbor who came to complain narrowly avoided a fiery explosion by walking away. Iris Eytan, Holmes former attorney, believed he was 'absolutely out of his mind'. 'Look at his eyes, they're completely dilated,' she said, referencing a mug shot showing Holmes with his hair dyed comic-book orange. 'He was under the influence of something, and I believe it was mental illness,' she said. Psychosis is something Holmes knew all about. Before the shooting, he was preparing to give a class presentation on 'MicroRNA Biomarkers', which provide a biological basis for psychiatric and neurological disorders. About the same time, he was amassing deadly firepower: Two Glock pistols. A shotgun. An AR-15 rifle. Boxes upon boxes of ammunition — 6,295 rounds in all. Police who searched his apartment also found prescription medications for anxiety and depression, 50 cans and bottles of beer, paper shooting targets, and a 'Batman' mask. Prosecutors believe it is all evidence of meticulous plotting, proving that the mass murder was deliberate and calculated. Prosecutors said James Holmes, 27, was once a sought-after neuroscientist-in-training, but evidence shows that months before the shooting he was preparing for violence . The prosecution is trying to prove that Holmes was not mentally ill and knew exactly what he was doing the when he opened fire during the midnight premiere of the Batman film 'The Dark Knight Rises' They pointed out that Holmes searched online for 'rational insanity,' and took haunting selfies the night of the shooting that show him sticking out his tongue and smiling with a Glock under his face. 'He didn't care who he killed or how many he killed, because he wanted to kill all of them,' Prosecutor Karen Pearson said. Holmes' former psychiatrist and two court-appointed doctors who spent days interviewing him will be questioned during the trial. They will likely be asked to explain how a seemingly harmless college student without so much as a traffic ticket on his record could march up and down a theater, mercilessly shooting down those who tried to flee. Holmes was a shy teen who graduated with highest honors from the University of California, Riverside, and then applied for elite doctoral programs. He landed at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus near Denver, one of just six students awarded entry into the exclusive doctoral program in June 2011. He also earned a National Institutes of Health grant for top performers. But by his second semester, he was flunking key exams and wasn't asked to join his professors' labs. A month before the shooting, Holmes officially withdrew from the university and saw his psychiatrist one last time before, according to his classmates, he fell out of sight. From July 5 to July 18, two days before the attack, Holmes logged onto a dating website with the handle 'classicjimbo.' His profile said he was seeking 'casual sex' and asked 'Will you visit me in prison?' If the 12 jurors decide Holmes was insane at the time of the shooting, he will avoid prison and be committed indefinitely to a state psychiatric hospital .

'But he’s going to win and I cannot wait to see him in the House of Commons, he will really shake things up, it is a very exciting prospect.'

She added: 'His health is fine, his health is absolutely fine and whilst Nigel is leader he has my 100% support.

In pain: Ukip leader Nigel Farage is suffering from a recurring spinal injury and is on medication . Miss Evans is seen as the party's rising star and has been increasingly tipped as Mr Farage's successor because of strong media performances. She wrote the party's general election manifesto. After the manifesto launch, she was praised for her assured and confident performance and she received Mr Farage’s personal thanks. In January she stepped in as policy chief after Tim Aker quit amid reports he was failing to deliver it on time. Miss Evans, who is a former BBC local radio journalist, works freelance as a PR and marketing consultant and in 2011 founded a health charity for women. In May 2013 she came to prominence when she defected from the Tories to Ukip with a group of councillors in Merton, south London, but she lost her seat in local election last year. She is regularly used by the party for appearances on programmes such as Question Time and Newsnight, and has been fronting the party’s election campaign morning press conferences. But despite increasing talk about her leadership potential, senior Ukip figures privately admit she is unlikely to be elected in Shrewsbury & Atcham, the Shropshire seat where she is standing to become MP. Mr Farage has said it would be difficult for his successor not to have a place in the Commons without the ‘potential for conflict’.","Suzanne Evans said she would step in if Farage quits because of ill health .

"The producers of the TV show Made In Chelsea pride themselves on featuring some of the poshest young ladies and gentleman in London. But even by their standards, Mark-Francis Vandelli is well-to-do - the privately educated son of a multimillionaire industrialist and model wouldn't have to work a day in his life if he chose not to. But if you weren't already envious of the reality star, he has now opened up his watch collection to the Evening Standard, showing off some of the 16 eye-wateringly expensive timepieces that he has been collecting since his teens. Scroll down for video . Made In Chelsea star Mark-Francis Vandelli is a keen collector of expensive watches . The 26 year old has got into the habit of buying a new watch each year, so that he will have an impressive collection by the time he reaches middle age. Many watch enthusiasts would argue that Mark-Francis has already reached that goal - he currently owns a number of pieces that are worth several thousand pounds. In a new interview with the newspaper, he revealed his favourite items and the history behind them. The include a Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42, a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée and a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetua. Mark-Francis's most expensive watch is a Cartier white gold Moonphase, which he bought from a shop on Sloane Street in Chelsea earlier this year. Mark-Francis's most expensive watch is a Cartier white gold Moonphase (left), while one of his flashiest is a  Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42 (right) It cost £32,000 and caught his eye because it has a sun or a moon than move on rotation depending on the hour of the day. One of the flashiest watches in his collection is the Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42, which he purchased on holiday in Italy and can be bought secondhand on the internet for £6,5000. He said of the item: 'When I was 16 my grandmother gave me the first prototype of the Bulgari Bulgari, which the Bulgari family had given her in the 1950s - I think it's one of the only ones that was actually hand engraved around the bezel.' Mark-Francis ended up buying this modern version after he fell into a river wearing his grandmother's version while out rowing at school. Mark Francis favours a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée timepiece because it is no longer made (left), while he wears a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetual when out raving in East London (right) While many of his watches are hard to come by, Mark Francis favours a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée timepiece in particular because it is no longer made, meaning he would be unlikely to be caught out wearing it at the same time as another man. Similar versions can be bought on the internet for around £9,000. He told the newspaper: 'Cartier doesn't make this one any more, which I love. I did see someone else wearing it once, however -  I was at the Wolseley and it was this fat American, I was mortified.' And finally, for the man who has a watch for every occasion - the timepiece that he wears when visiting East London... a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetual. Similar watches can be bought on the internet for £8,000. He said: 'You can swim in it, sleep in it, throw it around, go to a rave.

"A photo of a relaxed and happy surfer seems all but a distant memory as that same man is now fighting for his life after being mauled by a Great White Shark. Chris Blowes, was viciously attacked by what has been described as a ' massive monster', about 350 metres offshore near Right Point on the south-western side of Fishery Bay in Port Lincoln National Park, when he was attacked at 9.45am on Saturday. The 26-year-old is in a critical condition at the Royal Adelaide hospital after the horrifying moment which was witnessed by about a dozen other surfers who were in the water at the time and believed the six-metre creature swam away with the surfer's leg and a surfboard in its jaw. Scroll down for video . Chris Blowes (pictured left) is fighting for his life after being mauled by a Great White shark in South Australia . Mr Blowes was taken to Port Lincoln hospital before being airlifted to Adelaide on Saturday . Mr Blowes' family have released a statement expressing their gratitude for all of the support and well wishes they have received during this traumatic time. 'Currently our sole focus is on our unified, unconditional support and belief towards Christopher’s big fight he has ahead, and we ask that our privacy in being able to provide that is respected at this time,' the statement said. 'From the bottom of our hearts we wish to thank his inspirational mates who rescued him and got him to safety and all of the wonderful medical professionals both here in Adelaide and in Pt Lincoln who have attended to Christopher.' A Royal Adelaide hospital spokesman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Mr Blowes had lost a leg and was in a critical condition in intensive care. Onlookers have described the distressing moment they saw the surfer attacked by the predator. 'The shark came in and bit his leg off and the guys helped him in and carried him up the cliff,' said Glenn Lugg, who has been surfing in the area for 25 years. 'I was just watching the shark go out to the ocean with his board still attached. Obviously the shark still had his leg and he was still swimming around with it,' Mr Lugg told Adelaide Now. Friends have begun to send their love and support to Chris and his family on social media as he battles to stay alive following the horrendous incident . Concerned friends of Chris send their best wishes to him and his family . Friends have begun to send their love and support to Chris and his family on social media as he battles to stay alive following the horrendous incident. 'Thoughts are with Chris Blowes, family and friends. Get Well mate,' Daniel Gannon posted on Twitter. While Belinda Wicks posted on her Facebook page: 'Sending all my love and thoughts to Chris Blowes and family.' Mr Lugg was told to call an ambulance while his fellow surfers pulled Mr Blowes from the water, up the beach on a surfboard and into a car to take the 26-year-old to hospital. The shocked witness said the experience was 'pretty traumatic', but that everyone involved did a great job. A friend of Mr Blowes, Ty Swan, described the 26-year-old as a 'good bloke', and that he had been bitten in the middle of the thigh. Mr Swan placed a sign at the popular tourist beach to let others know of the attack. Another witness, who was surfing at the time, told Daily Mail Australia that 'there was blood everywhere'. The injured man was initially taken to Port Lincoln Hospital with life-threatening injuries but been been airlifted to Adelaide for further treatment. Shocked witnesses said after the attack, which took place at Fishery Bay, South Australia, the six-metre shark was seen swimming away with the surfer's leg in its mouth . The 26-year-old was airlifted to Adelaide for further treatment after he was bitten by a shark . Another man said those closest to the badly injured surfer acted quickly without any thought of danger to themselves. 'I was just watching the shark go out to the ocean with his board still attached,' another witness told the Sunday Mail. 'Obviously the shark still had his leg and he was still swimming around with it.' The man said even though he was 50 metres from the shark, he could see its 'massive' pectoral fin - and he had no doubts it was a great white shark, the most feared creature in the sea. However details of the type of shark and the man's injuries have not been released or confirmed. Mr Blowes is in a critical condition after the shark attack in Fishery Bay, Port Lincoln, in South Australia . Fishery Bay is on South Australia's west coast, which is about seven hours from Adelaide . Witnesses have described the horrifying moment that they saw Mr Blowes mauled by a Great White shark . After the shark victim had been brought ashore and carried up a slope to a parking area, he was loaded into a car. He remains in a critical condition after beign airlifted via a MedSTAR retrieval team to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for further treatment. Police were working with Fisheries officials, the local council and Surf Life Saving SA to post signs on the beach warning others promptly after the shark attack. The attack happened during conditions that police and marine experts have previously said are dangerous. The overcast conditions make it difficult for surfers to see sharks that might be in the area and it is believed that sharks often mistake humans for seals or dolphins. The incident comes after surfer Jake Heron managed to fight off a four metre Great White at the same beach 10 years ago which attacked him just 10 metres from shore by punching and kicking it . He escaped with 20 stitches in his arm and 40 stitches in his thigh. Jake Heron was mauled by a four-metre Great White in 2005 . Wildcatch Fisheries SA chairman Jonas Woolford said the number of shark sightings in the area had risen recently. 'There has been a number of sightings just recently actually at a number of locations along the coast near to Fishery Bay, just around the corner, the sightings have said that the sharks have been rather aggressive actually,' Mr Woolford told the ABC. 'It's been reported that there hasn't been many for about 10 or so weeks, so whether those ones that have been laying low are now coming back to the areas which they normally frequent and they may be rather hungry ... but yes, there has been more sightings around just recently.'","Chris Blowes is in a critical condition after a shark attack in South Australia .

"David Cameron this afternoon hit back at growing criticism over his election campaign – vowing to carry on warning about Labour's threat to the economy. The Prime Minister this morning faced the first serious criticism of the campaign so far, as Tory donors rounded on the party's lacklustre message and failure to pull away in the polls. But a defiant Mr Cameron this afternoon pledged to continue focussing on bread-and-butter issues like jobs, business and childcare. Scroll down for video . David Cameron this afternoon hit back at growing criticism over his election campaign – vowing to carry on warning about Labour's threat to the economy . He told supporters in Somerset: 'If you want political excitement. Go to Greece. If you want more showbiz in this election. Go to Hollywood. 'But here and now in the UK I'm focused on something real – a stronger economy.' Mr Cameron insisted the economy 'excites' millions of people. He said he would campaign on 'more jobs, more homes, more business, more childcare, more security in retirement'. He said: 'I make no apologies for focusing hard on that which is central to everything. When you get a new job, a new home, get a new childcare place or start a new business… now that's truly exiting. 'And you only get these things with a strong and stable government - not one held to ransom. That's not the excitement 'Britain needs. That's not a risk Britain should take.' Mr Cameron's remarks comes amid claims senior Tory figures are already planning to make Boris Johnson the next leader. Some MPs are prepared to engineer a coup against Mr Cameron in the days after May 7 by submitting letters of no-confidence in him and planning a 'mass show of support' for the London Mayor if the Tories lose, the Sunday Times reported. One major donor, who declined to be named, told the newspaper: 'Boris is the only one who can win. Everyone knows what is going to happen in 10 days' time. If Dave doesn't make it we'll get rid of him.' The Tories have nudged ahead in the polls with less than two weeks to go until polling day, but Tories are increasingly concerned it may be too little too late . London Mayor Boris Johnson - appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning, has distanced himself from claims that he is being lined up to replace David Cameron as Tory leader . Multimillionaire Tory donor Peter Hall, who has given almost £600,000 to the Tory party since 2005, meanwhile has criticised Mr Cameron's 'curious lack of energy and belief in his campaign.' He said the PM needs to raise his game and 'unleash visceral passion and belief in his vision of the future', 'get down and dirty', as well as showing 'he cares', if he is to win on May 7. 'If we don't have a Conservative government after May 7 it will be because of David Cameron. His decision not to keep those Ukip people in the Tory tribe was a key error. 'I see no powerful vision of the future provided by David Cameron. There is no clear considered view of where we are headed.' Mr Hall warned that Cameron's mantra as a sound steward of the economy 'is not enough to win the votes needed to win the election' and added: 'Some people are really quite resigned to losing and they are planning the next step. 'It's a horrifying prospect if we were to lose. How can we lose when so much is at stake and when we have such a strong hand?'","Prime Minister insists he will carry on focussing on economic message .

"Paul Gambaccini blamed the presenters' obsession with discussing the sex appeal of pop stars for a slump in ratings . It has been a staple of Sunday night listening for almost 50 years – but now Radio 1's Chart Show has been branded a 'banal failure' by one of the most respected voices in broadcasting. Veteran presenter Paul Gambaccini has blasted the BBC for destroying the Top 40 show by employing 'ignorant' DJs who are more interested in giving vacuous opinions than playing the records. Gambaccini, a respected rock historian, blamed the presenters' obsession with discussing the sex appeal of pop stars for a slump in ratings. The 66-year-old said: 'It is no wonder the Chart Show is a complete failure because it has not accomplished what it was set out to be. It is the news of popular music and, if it is to have any integrity, it should be an objective show. You wouldn't expect Huw Edwards to give his opinion on the news he is reading or to suddenly say 'Isn't Hillary Clinton fit?' The Chart Show has become an extension of its presenter's personality rather than an objective programme.' Gambaccini, a former Radio 1 DJ himself, said he was particularly annoyed about last week's show when host Clara Amfo appeared to dismiss superstar Paul Simon, who had just topped the album charts at the age of 73. The 29-year-old made a passing reference to the star's No 1 album, The Ultimate Collection, before telling listeners to 'ask your dad'. Gambaccini said: 'To me that is an ignorant attitude. You don't disrespect the No 1 album, regardless of who it's by. 'What is the point of saying this is the Top 5 and not playing any of them? That is really stupid. No 1 is No 1. If you don't wish to be authoritative any more you might as well stop. Don't pretend you are important when you are not.' 'Paul Simon has just sold out the O2 with Sting. We are talking about a current major figure in popular music. These are people who will be enjoyed long after our lifetimes as we know and enjoy Beethoven.' The Chart Show has had a presence on Sunday nights in one form or another since the days of Alan 'Fluff' Freeman when Radio 1 launched in 1967. The current version has seen its audience dwindle from a peak of four million in the early 1980s to about 1.2 million. It will end in July, when the chart rundown will become part of Greg James's Friday drivetime show, to reflect changes in the music industry. Gambaccini, who recently returned to Radio 2 after being cleared over historic sex abuse claims, said: 'I wish Greg James well but it will never have the impact being a feature of his programme that it had on a Sunday.' The BBC said: 'The Chart Show is an entertainment programme and as such our DJs present the countdown in a way that is engaging and relevant to our young audience.' In February, Radio 1 was at the centre of another ageism storm after The Mail on Sunday revealed Madonna had been dropped from the playlist. Gambaccini, a former Radio 1 DJ himself, said he was particularly annoyed about last week's show when host Clara Amfo (pictured) appeared to dismiss superstar Paul Simon .","Paul Gambaccini has blasted the BBC for destroying the Top 40 show .

"Sydneysiders already reeling from a three day 'cyclone' were hit again on Saturday, as the city was pummelled by a massive hail storm. Marble-sized hailstones, some up to 2cm in diameter pounded multiple suburbs in the city's east and west on ANZAC Day, coating streets and backyards in sleet despite only lasting for around three hours. Saturday's freak weather could be explained by constantly changing atmospheric conditions and bursts of ice-cold air, said Bureau of Meteorology NSW Manager of Weather Services, Andrew Treloar. Scroll down for video . Many took to social media on Saturday to post incredible pictures of residents tobogganing and snow boarding down streets in Newtown . According to Mr Grose, a large storm with an East Coast Low have always occurred within Australia, passing through every few years . But there's a longer term story behind the recent spate of wild weather, one scientist said. 'Climate has been changing in recent decades and will continue to change throughout this century and beyond,' CSIRO, Research Scientist Michael Grose told Daily Mail Australia. According to Mr Grose, Saturday's storm was the result of an East Coast Low, which is also known as an extratropical cyclone. This type of storm has always occurred in Australia, passing through every few years, however changes to the frequency and intensity are possible due to climate change. 'Increases in temperature and rising sea levels are the most clear changes in the climate due to human influence,' he said.

'At the height of the storm we had two hundred calls in the system, mostly about flooding in people' homes and businesses, rescues from flash flooding - in the inner city they're not as dangerous because people are just trapped in their cars and not at risk of being swept away - and automatic fire alarms,' Supt Johnston said. 'The highest rainfalls recorded during the event were 60mm at Prospect Reservoir and 53mm at Blacktown, much of which fell within 1 hour. There were also reports of flash flooding in the Metropolitan area,' Mr Treloar said.

"Ukip 'hates modern Britain' and is infected with the 'virus of racism', rising Labour star Chuka Umunna has claimed. The shadow business secretary said Nigel Farage had 'a problem with race' following his remarks last about 'fully black' and 'half black' Ukip supporters. Mr Umunna's remarks come after Mr Farage dragged into a fresh racism storm after National Front members turned up to campaign for him in his South Thanet constituency. Scroll down for video . Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said Nigel Farage had 'a problem with race' following his remarks last about 'fully black' and 'half black' Ukip supporters . The row started after a group of far-Right supporters calling themselves the East Kent English Patriots supported Mr Farage at an event in Broadstairs on Friday evening. They were led by Gary Field, a former regional organiser for the English Defence League, and enjoyed the protection of Ukip's security teams, which encircled the Broadstairs Pavilion. Mr Field, who has a criminal record for assault, drank beers behind the cordon with fellow members of his group and gestured to onlookers as a crowd waited for Mr Farage's arrival. The Ukip leader moved to disown the far-right campaigners, saying: 'Members of an extremist group today arrived at a Ukip public meeting at the same time as a Mail on Sunday camera arrives.' But Labour's Mr Umunna, whose father was born in Nigeria, accused Ukip of whipping up 'anti-immigration sentiment'. Mr Umunna said: 'The likes of Ukip don't like what modern Britain is. They claim to love Britain, but they hate modern Britain. If I'm wrong about that why do we see a stream of invective directed at different groups in society from their candidates and their members? 'There is a virus of racism which runs through that party which they've failed to deal with, and I'm not surprised given their leader doesn't see the need for equalities legislation that we have in Britain today and that we're very proud of.' UKIP leader Nigel Farage, stopping for a pint in Ramsgate, Kent, was accused of having a 'problem with race' Gary Field, a former regional organiser for the English Defence League (pictured in the white hat) turned up to campaign for Ukip in South Thanet constituency last week . Last week, Mr Farage defended Ukip's manifesto, which featured only one ethnic-minority person, saying the party had one spokesman who was 'fully black' and another who was 'half black'. Responding to these remarks, Mr Umunna said: 'I just think the guy's got a problem with race. I'm just saying what I think. 'As a party they've got a problem with race. And I don't think you can kick out racism from their party unless you have got a leadership which understands it and understands race in modern Britain. 'I have no truck with this notion that immigrants are to blame for all of the country's problems. We saw people do that to black and Asian people like my father in the Sixties and Seventies, and now the group they're trying to blame for all their problems are Eastern Europeans.'","Shadow business secretary said Nigel Farage had 'a problem with race'

"Sit down for a moment. Relax. Then clasp your hands together so your fingers entwine — don’t overthink it! Now look at your thumbs. Which one is on top — the left one or the right? If you are a man, the odds are it will be the left; if you are a woman, it is more likely to be the right. Now unfold your hands and take a look at your fingers, in particular your index finger (next to your thumb) and your ring finger (next to your little finger). It can be quite subtle, but in men the ring finger (measured from the crease where it joins the hand) is likely to be longer than the index finger. In women the two fingers are typically the same length. Scroll down for video . Strangely enough, your hands give clues to what is sometimes called ‘brain sex’ — the way your brain reflects your gender. Of course, we all have different skills and interests, but some are considered more typically male, and occur more commonly in men, while others are described as more typically female, and occur more commonly in women. According to popular mythology, men tend to be more obsessed by things such as cars and obscure facts. You find men in pubs discussing the top speed of a car they are never going to drive, let alone own. They cling to the TV remote control. They like spending time in sheds. Women, on the other hand, are said to be better at empathy and understanding what another person is feeling or needs. In an emotional crisis, they are more likely to offer sympathy. If you are a man you may be surprised to learn that there are more than 400 different human emotions. If you’re a woman you probably knew that already. This is the stuff of jokes and self-help books — but it is also shown to be true through science. The question is, do these tendencies result from nature — with the biological gender we are born with deciding our interests and personalities — or do they result from nurture, with society and upbringing creating the differing ways that men and women behave? In the SBS One series Horizon Professor Alice Roberts and Dr Michael Mosley examine the links between gender and the brain . The SBS One series Horizon asked Professor Alice Roberts and me to investigate. We started from very different positions. Alice thinks apparent brain differences between the sexes have been exaggerated by how our culture treats boys and girls. In the programme she carries out fascinating tests to prove her point, such as dressing up little boys as girls and vice versa and watching how people treat them. Almost immediately, the girls start rough-housing and playing with trucks, while the boys are treated far more gently by the adults around them. She argues that parents’ unconscious actions — such as being gentler with girls and letting boys behave more roughly — often mould children into men and women who embody gender stereotypes. While I agree that lots of wild generalisations about men and women are bandied around, I also think there may be something in claims that our fundamental biology influences how we behave. Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, an expert on the brain who I visited at Cambridge University, has done a lot of pioneering work on this. He believes, broadly, that people of whatever gender fall somewhere along a ‘systemiser’ to ‘empathiser’ spectrum. Systemisters: According to popular mythology, men tend to be more obsessed by things such as cars and obscure facts, like these young train spotters pictured at Chislehurst and Sidcup station . Systemisters are people who enjoy breaking down and analysing systems. They are more likely to become train spotters or computer scientists. They are what he has called ‘male brained’ — as these qualities occur most frequently, but far from exclusively, in men. Empathisers, on the other hand, are more typically ‘female’ brained as they are more typically women. Although there are exceptions, most men — when tested — come out as more ‘systemising’ than ‘empathising’, while for women it is the other way round. While Professor Baron-Cohen accepts social pressures are important in influencing choices and behaviour, his studies suggest the hormones babies are exposed to in the womb can also shape the brain. Higher levels of testosterone in utero, for example — as measured in long-term studies that took samples from pregnant women then followed their children from birth — are associated with offspring who are less empathetic but better at some mental skills later in life. In other words, more testosterone during pregnancy produces babies with a more male brain (we’re not yet sure why some mothers produce more testosterone). Dr Mosley will examine if habits, characteristics and preferences are a result of 'nature or nurture' Empathisers, on the other hand, are more typically ‘female’ brained as they are more typically women . An indirect way of assessing how much testosterone you were exposed to is by looking at your fingers. A number of studies have shown that the greater the difference between the length of the ring finger and the index finger, the more ‘male’ your brain is likely to be. Mine is slightly more ‘male’ than average but much less so than, say, a professional footballer, who is typically male brained with great spatial awareness skills. As you can imagine, this is a controversial area of science. Professor Baron-Cohen does these studies because he is interested in autism, which he describes as an extreme version of the male brain — more interested in systems and often struggling with empathy. When he started his research there was a lot of criticism, based partly on the fear studies like his will be used to support unhelpful stereotypes — suggesting men can’t excel in female areas and vice versa. Ignoring gender differences, however, comes with its own dangers. Take the problem of pain. A while ago, when I was making a programme called Pleasure And Pain, we did a survey where we asked people which of the sexes they thought was better at tolerating pain — 81 per cent of women said ‘women’, while a mere 11 per cent thought men were the tougher breed. A number of studies have shown that the greater the difference between the length of the ring finger and the index finger, the more ‘male’ your brain is likely to be . Although men were more inclined to give themselves the benefit of the doubt, the majority, 54 per cent, still agreed ‘women’ were more stoical. But is this right? One way to find out is to get male and female volunteers to take part in a cold water immersion test. This is a standard pain test widely used because it causes acute pain without doing any long-term damage (as long as you don’t do it for more than 15 minutes). In this test, you put your hand in a bucket of ice-cold water and see how long you can keep it there before the pain becomes intolerable. I’ve done it a couple of times and oddly enough after the initial shock it doesn’t actually feel cold; below about 3 degrees Celsius your pain receptors overwhelm your temperature receptors so you are no longer able to tell if the water is hot or freezing. All you know is that it is incredibly painful. When this test is done in a laboratory setting, men almost always outlast women. This may be pure machismo, but Professor Jeff Mogil of McGill University, Montreal, thinks there is more to it. As he puts it: ‘There are all kinds of reasons to believe there are different neural systems in the brain of males and females.’ That is, our brains process pain differently because our brains are different: our varying ability to withstand pain is proof. He thinks it is unfortunate that much basic pain research has, until recently, been done in male animals. Although men were more inclined to give themselves the benefit of the doubt, the majority, 54 per cent, still agreed ‘women’ were more stoical . Males don’t menstruate or go on heat, which makes them simpler and cheaper to study. But it also means we have been developing and testing drugs on males, assuming that they will work just as well on females, which may not be the case. We’ve come to realise, for example, paracetamol works better on men, while some opioids work better on women. We don’t, however, know why. That situation is now changing as researchers involve more females and start actively looking for differences. Indeed, Jeff imagines a future where pharmaceutical companies produce pain-killing drugs that are specific to one gender. So perhaps we’ll have pink painkillers for women, and blue ones for boys, each honed to work on the specific male or female brain. ‘If that happens,’ says Jeff, ‘that’ll be a first in medicine.’ It may also mean far more effective medication for all of us. Head injury, a leading cause of death and disability in young people, is another area where studying gender differences could bring significant benefits. Is your brain male or female? Documentary premieres on SBS One on Monday at 7.30pm . A couple of years ago, I was in a large military hospital in Afghanistan, filming a series called Frontline Medicine for the BBC. I saw a number of soldiers, male and female, with serious head injuries. I was told that the women were likely to make a better recovery than the men. Why? It may be, in part, because women have higher levels of progesterone. Progesterone is best known as a female hormone, involved in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy, but it is also important for the development of neurones — the cells that carry messages in the brain. Animal studies and a few small human trials have shown that giving progesterone soon after suffering a brain injury improves survival and recovery. Larger studies, some of them funded by the military, are currently underway. This, I think, is why researching gender differences is worth doing. It is not because it will help us understand why men struggle to remember their children’s birthdays or why there are fewer female darts players, but because it may help us find more effective ways to tackle disease.

"More than a thousand twitchers travelled to Somerset this weekend after a rare bird was spotted for only the third time in the UK. They descended on the West Country when a Hudsonian Godwit made a 4,000 mile detour from South America. It is believed the large shorebird - that was heading to its breeding grounds in Canada and Alaska - was last seen in the UK in 1988. The Hudsonian Godwit was spotted at the Shapwick Heath in Somerset and drew scores of bird watchers . More than a thousand bird watchers and photographers lined the water's edge to catch a glimpse of the bird . The wader - with a long beak and spindly legs - is now inhabiting the same space as its English counterparts, the Black Tailed Godwit at the Shapwick Heath, in Somerset. The commotion started when a birdwatcher identified one of the rare birds on the Somerset Levels and word got around. Over the weekend, more than 1,000 twitchers had lined the water's edge. The wader  is now inhabiting the same space as its English counterparts, the Black Tailed Godwit . Photographers line the water's shore to take the perfect shot of the rare bird, only in the UK for the third time . Each spring the Hudsonian Godwit heads from South America to its breeding grounds in Canada and Alaska. In good weather, many birds make the trip south without stopping. A small number migrate in the wrong direction. These birds forage by probing in shallow water. They mainly eat insects and crustaceans. Both parents look after the young birds, who find their own food and are able to fly within a month of hatching. Their numbers were reduced by hunting at the end of the 19th century. One birdwatcher Michael Trew, 70, said word spread about the bird via an online forum at 7.30am yesterday. The retired quantity surveyor said: 'By the time I got there at about 9.30am there was the best part of 200 people there, but about 1,000 had turned up by the time I left. 'I think the last time anyone saw one of these it was about 30 years ago. 'It's not a migrating bird - it's not supposed to be here at all - and we can only assume it is one that has got lost. 'We only think that it has got mixed up in a flock of migrating birds and made its way here. It is quite a strange affair. We don't know how long it has even been here. 'It was spotted by someone who thought 'that one looks a bit different' but these things have to be verified before you get people driving from all over the place to see it. 'Someone came and checked and the word went out about 7.30am. 'I have only been bird watching for five years so it is quite good to have seen one - some people will have waited 30 years. 'They have just built a new car park down there which is just as well because it was filled and then double parked. 'It was a really nice day with everyone down there.'","Rare bird was heading from South America to breeding grounds in Alaska .

"The CEO of the Italian eyewear company that makes Ray-Bans said that his company is working with Google on two new versions of its Google Glass project. Massimo Vian, one of the heads of Milan-based Luxottica, said that his team was looking to improve on the Internet-connected device, which was trumpeted as a huge technological leap forward when it was announced in 2012. However, Google stopped selling the first version and shut its pre-launch Explorer program for Google Glass earlier this year, prompting speculation about the demise of the wearable gadget before it became widely available. Massimo Vian, one of the heads of Milan-based Luxottica, said that his team was working on two new versions of Google Glass, one of which was 'in preparation' Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt later appointed a new leader for the product and said that it would be 'ready for users', according to the Wall Street Journal. 'There’s nothing about adjusting Glass that suggests we’re ending it,' he said. Vian told Luxottica shareholders that his company is 'now working on Google Glass version 2 which is in preparation'. He did not give any details about a proposed launch date for the second version. The executive has recently been to California to meet with Google's team. New versions of Google Glass, which was unveiled three years ago as a prototype available for $1,500, are thought to aim at a lower cost, longer battery life and improved sound quality. It officially offered the product to the public in 2014, though sales were low. Vian (pictured) told shareholders of his company, which makes Ray Bans, that there were 'some second thoughts' about what version three of Google Glass would be. Part of the perceived failure of the first version of the product was the mockery it generated towards 'glassholes' who wore the odd-looking gadgets. 'There are some second thoughts on how to interpret version 3' of Google Glass, Vian said, according to NDTV. Details about what the new versions will look like have not yet been released. Processor company Intel is expected to create the chip in the device.","Massimo Vian, head of Luxottica, says version two 'in preparation'

Despite the plummeting temperatures and rain, crowds had started to form outside the building late last night . Even more passengers flocked to the airport this morning, including families huddled together beneath blankets. Many visitors had already booked return journeys  but had crowded outside the airport in the hope of boarding the next available flight back to India. Others had been left stranded after some flights out of the capital city were cancelled. As the departure lounges grew busier, security guards were unable to control the sheer number of passengers vying for a coveted place in the queue. The airport's parking lot was converted into a makeshift waiting area to accommodate travellers. Mohammad Pervez, one of the passengers outside the airport, told NDTV: 'There is no water here or food. I have been sitting with my wife and child since early morning. We just want to get back home to India now.' Lu Hee, who was playing cards with friends in the waiting area, said: 'I had come only two days ago. But now, I want to head back to my home in Tibet. A tourist sits with scores of other passengers who are trying to get a flight out of Kathmandu in the aftermath of the quake . Crowds formed in the departure lounges as passengers waited for information. Many people had booked flights for later in the day but were hopeful on leaving the country on an earlier flight . But she added: 'I don't mind waiting here. At least I am thankful for being alive.' The earthquake, which struck on Saturday, came at a busy time of year, with an estimated 300,000 foreign tourists in the country. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, relies heavily on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing. The death toll has already hit 2,500 people, with the historic city Kathmandu - and all its famous sites - now reduced to rubble. The Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu had been briefly shut down yesterday due to a powerful aftershock from the 7.9 magnitude quake. According to reports, the impact was so great that planes had to turn around mid-flight. The airport in Kathmandu was briefly shut down due to a powerful aftershock from the 7.9 magnitude quake . Today, Indian soldiers arrived with supplies to Tribhuwan International Airport following the quake . India's budget SpiceJet said it was forced to recall its plane to New Delhi after the air traffic control centre at Kathmandu's airport was evacuated. Meanwhile, two Air India flights - carrying 135 and 45 passengers - were also turned back after the evacuation on the ground, according to the Press Trust of India news agency. The Indian Air Force evacuated several hundred stranded tourists but commercial flights were resumed just one hour later. The temporary shutdown highlights the difficulty facing Nepal's authorities, who are struggling to rescue and treat thousands of people in the capital. As well as killing more than 2,000 people nationwide, the quake toppled whole buildings and ripped apart roads and other infrastructure, cutting off electricity and communication networks.","Passengers joined 1km-long queue outside Tribhuwan International Airport .

"A Massachusetts boy who received more than 150,000 letters and packages after requesting 'a box of cards' for his sixth birthday has died after his battle with a rare brain tumor. Danny Nickerson, six, who loved to receive mail, was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor in October 2013. Last July, his birthday request for  cards with his name on them went viral. He received mail from around the world and got more mail in one day than the rest of the town combined, according to Fox News. On Friday night, his mother Carley Nickerson shared on a Facebook page, Danny's Warriors, that her 'precious sweet boy earned his angel wings' after a 'courageous 18 month battle'. Danny Nickerson (left), 6, of Massachusetts died of an inoperable brain tumor after a 'courageous 18-month battle' Last July, his request for a 'box of cards' for his sixth birthday went viral and he received more than 150,000 cards from around the world (above Nickerson last summer with the mail he received) 'Our lord came and carried his body to heaven,' she wrote on April 24. 'His body was so tired of fighting. 'He is now cancer free and running and playing and laughing with God and all of the other precious children. 'Prayers are needed for all of us right now. Please surround us in your prayers.' On Friday night, his mother, Carley Nickerson (pictured above with him), wrote that her 'precious sweet boy earned his angel wings' Nickerson was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glimoma (DIPG) in October 2013 and fought through 33 radiation treatments . According to ABC News, doctors said that less than ten per cent of children with the disease, called Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glimoma, live longer than 18 months. Nickerson was first diagnosed with the DIPG after he complained about having double vision. Over the course of four days, he saw multiple doctors before finally getting an MRI. 'After the MRI, we were taken into a small room and given the worst news we have ever heard,' Mrs Nickerson said when she learned of his diagnosis. 'Our lives fell apart, my heart felt like it exploded. There were no words to explain the pain that instantly hit my chest.' For his sixth birthday last July, he requested a 'box of cards' and received an overwhelming number in the mail after his mother asked people on Facebook to send her son a birthday card. On a Facebook page, Danny's Warriors, Mrs Nickerson wrote of her son's passing: 'He is now cancer free and running and playing and laughing with God and all of the other precious children' After Mrs Nickerson took to Facebook asking people to send her son a birthday card, they were 'shocked and overwhelmed' by the amount of mail they received . To get all of the the mail to his home, it took four trucks and a U-Haul. He received cards from around the world and got more mail in one day than the rest of the town combined . When his family received all of the cards, Mrs Nickerson said they were 'shocked and speechless', and that the cards included 'a picture of a fat cat on it and another with a cat blowing out candles' which made her son laugh. To get the mail to his Foxboro home, it took four trucks and a U-Haul, according to MyFoxBoston.com. Last summer, Nickerson was also met by police officers from around the state and members of the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium to celebrate his sixth birthday, according to CBS Boston. On a You Caring page for Nickerson, his mother wrote that he has fought through 33 radiation treatments and two clinical trials which consisted of chemotherapy. The page also said Nickerson enjoyed playing  with his brother, Matthew, and enjoyed anything that made him laugh. A mass will be held on Wednesday to celebrate his life at St. Mary's Church in Wrentham on Wednesday at 11am.","Danny Nickerson was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor in 2013 .

"These shocking photographs reveal the terrible toll the Nepal earthquake has had on some of the country's most beautiful and historic landmarks. The monuments of Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, are recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site because of their unique architecture. But several of the most recognisable buildings in the city, including towers and temples, now lie in rubble after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit the country yesterday morning. Scroll down for videos . Destruction: The Dharahara Tower, which was first built in 1832, has been almost completely obliterated by Nepal's earthquake . Historic: The now-destroyed tower was a UNESCO World Heritage Site until its destruction this weekend . Before: The Kathmandu Durbar Square, at the heart of Nepal's capital, is full of temples and historic houses with their distinctive roofs . After: The square is now piled with rubble after tall temples were brought down by the force of the earthquake . More than 2,500 people died in the quake as buildings collapsed raining down debris on the streets below, while enormous avalanches on Mount Everest left climbers dead. One of the most prominent landmarks to be destroyed by the earthquake was the Dharahara Tower, also known at the Bhimsen Tower, which has almost totally collapsed after more than 180 years of standing in Kathmandu. The 200ft tower was built in 1832 by prime minister Bhimsen Thapa as a gift to the queen, who was also his niece. It had to be rebuilt after a previous earthquake in 1934, but the latest disaster has left the tower as nothing more than a stump, killing scores of people who were trapped inside at the time. Destination: Another view of the Kathmandu Durbar Square shows how it was a thriving hub for the city . Reconstruction: Policemen were sent in to the square after it was badly affected by the quake . Venerable: The Durbar High School in the square is a neo-classical building which was shabby but grand before the earthquake . Debris: The school is now surrounded by bricks shaken from the building in the quake . Heritage: The Bhaktapur Durbar Square, pictured before the quake, is another one of the three main public spaces in the Kathmandu area . Piles: The square in Bhaktapur has rubble heaped up after its ancient temples were damaged . Kathmandu's three 'Durbar Squares', the courtyards outside the city's old royal palaces, were devastated by the earthquake, with historic temples razed to the ground by the shocks. In the largest, known as the Kathmandu Durbar Square, rubble was piled up today after a large stepped temple was obliterated in the quake. Images of the Durbar Squares in Patan and Bhaktapur, on the outskirts of Kathmandu, were also devastated by the shocks. The streets of Bhaktapur were impassable because of the rubble which lay several feet deep, with fragments of religious sculptures among the stonework on the ground. In Patan, a temple had its tower broken in half, while the square was strewn with bricks. Centre: The Patan Durbar Square, pictured before the disaster, is the third major hub of the historic royal family which has been devastated . Shock: Religious sculptures were lying on the ground in Patan after the temples they were once part of collapsed . Decapitated: A statue of the Hindu deity Garud was knocked off its pedestal at Patan Durbar Square . Crooked: The stupa of a temple was almost completely ripped off by the force of the quake . Holy: The Syambhunaath Stupa, known as the monkey temple, is pictured left before and right after the quake . Witness: A monk surveys the aftermath of the quake, which left the main building untouched . The Syambhunaath Stupa, known as the 'monkey temple' which stands on a hill above the capital, also suffered severe damage. While the complex's main golden tower was thankfully untouched, many other temple buildings were totally destroyed. The Buddhist site dates back 1,500 years, and is considered one of the holiest places in the world for residents of neighbouring Tibet. The 7.8 magnitude quake struck just before midday yesterday, sending tremors through the Kathmandu Valley and the nearby city of Pokhara. Busy: The packed streets of Kathmandu pictured as they were before the disaster . Damage: A huge crack opened in the middle of the highway after the earthquake . The majority of fatalities were reported in Nepal, with deaths also being confirmed in India, Tibet, Bangladesh and the Nepal-China border. About an hour after the initial quake, a magnitude 6.6 aftershock hit and smaller aftershocks could be felt through the region for hours. Rescuers are still battling to save the lives of those trapped in the rubble, while climbers on Everest are waiting to be rescued by helicopter.","The Dharahara Tower in Kathmandu was brought down by the force of yesterday's 7.8 magnitude earthquake .

"A Missouri mother believes her three-year-old daughter with special needs was discriminated against after finding out the child was forced to take off her thick glasses for a school portrait. Abby Lubiewski was born with Hallerman-Streiff, a rare genetic syndrome that resulted in congenital cataracts. She can only perceive light and dark when she's not wearing her specs. 'She has no vision at all without her glasses,' her mother Amanda Lubiewski told Fox 2 Now. When Lubiewski received her daughter Abby's photographs, she immediately saw that her child's smile was strained. Scroll down for video . Abby Lubiewski's mother Amanda was outraged after finding out her three-year-old daughter with special needs was forced to take her thick glasses off for school picture day . When Lubiewski received her daughter Abby's photographs, she immediately saw that her child's smile was strained and said it was because Abby 'couldn't see' 'I knew then that she couldn't see,' she said. 'And I couldn't quite comprehend what would be going through someone's mind to ask her to take those off.' Lubiewski wrote a post on Facebook about how her daughter 'loves her glasses' and 'needs them to function to the best of her ability,' Yahoo! Parenting reported. 'She is a strong, confident girl and deserves to show off every beautiful part of her, including her glasses.' Lubiewski said that when Abby saw her school photo she asked, 'What happened to my glasses?' But the mother was even more concerned knowing that official school portraits are released to the public if a child goes missing. 'This is very unsafe for her,' she told Fox 2 Now. 'Her picture doesn't look like her without glasses.' When Lubiewski found out other children at Abby's school were allowed to wear their glasses for the photographs, she felt her daughter had been discriminated against. Abby was born with Hallerman-Streiff, a rare genetic syndrome that resulted in congenital cataracts. She can only perceive light and dark when she's not wearing her specs and 'has no vision at all without her glasses' Lubiewski was even more concerned knowing that police release official school portraits to the public if a child goes missing. 'This is very unsafe for her,' she said. 'Her picture doesn't look like her without glasses' Lubiewski contacted LifeTouch School Photography on Facebook and told them 'how disrespectful' the family thought it was for the company to treat Abby 'differently than other children in the school'. 'Photographers for school pictures need to be trained on how to capture each unique child,' she wrote on Facebook. 'Even those with disabilities.' Lubiewski said other photographers in the past have been able to work around the glare Abby's thick specs can sometimes cause for the camera. Two pictures of Abby wearing glasses were taken by the photographer, but she wasn't looking at the camera. 'It's not just about getting a cute picture of her,' the mother said. 'It's how she was treated, and how it seems like she was treated differently because there was a part of her that was difficult to photograph.' LifeTouch School Photography has since apologized to the family. 'We should have never had your daughter remove her glasses for the photo,' the company said to the family. 'We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind on our team.' Abby will get another chance to have her school picture free of charge on Monday after LifeTouch offered to re-take it.

"Poet: Sappho declared her love for women . The Greek island of Lesbos may be inextricably linked to the idea of female homosexuality – but in ancient times it was a notorious sexual playground for straight men, who found the local women irresistible. In a new BBC documentary, former Apprentice star Margaret Mountford will reveal that the island was the Magaluf of its day, and a capital for sex tourism. Professor Edith Hall from King's College London tells the programme: 'Lesbos had a very particular reputation for producing very beautiful women. They really were supposed to be the sexiest people in the entire Greek world.' She added that, in the Ancient Greek world, the word 'lesbian' actually meant a woman performing an intimate sex act on a man. Professor Hall also explained that the fact that Lesbos was closer to Turkey than Athens only added to the sexual allure of the women. She said: 'They also had a very interesting accent which would have sounded almost oriental to the Athenians. They were nearer Asia so their Greek accent would have been inflected like that.' Mountford then describes the island as 'the sex tourism capital of the ancient Aegean'. The programme examines the life and legacy of the female poet Sappho, who lived on the island around 600BC. She was one of the great writers of the ancient world, and wrote poems which appeared to be declarations of love for other women. As a result, both 'Sapphic' and the name of the island have now become synonymous with lesbianism – although such usage only started in the 19th Century. In 2008, residents of the island lost a legal fight to ban the use of the word 'lesbian' to describe gay women, arguing that the term violated their human rights and 'disgraced' them around the world. In the documentary, Mountford travels to Lesbos to try to uncover the truth about Sappho's life. The poet is believed to have had a daughter, and Mountford explores the differences between the ancient Greek concept of homosexuality and our own. Lesbos had a particular reputation for producing very beautiful women, the TV show will reveal . Modern day comparison: The island of Lesbos was the Magaluf of its day and a capital for sex tourism . Professor James Davidson said the willingness of the Ancient Greeks to embrace both male and female homosexuality may have been as much social as sexual. He said: 'Societies are strange and societies do strange things. This is a really peculiar cultural phenomenon. Instead of Greek homosexuality, I think it should be called Greek homo-besottedness. 'It is always over the top. It is always so extreme. 'The whole phenomenon of Greek homosexuality for men and for women seems to be a kind of cultural and social institution. 'They are using it as a way of social cohesion to break out of family groups and to establish communities. 'Sappho was a phenomenon but any kind of genius still follows the culture of their time.' Sappho: Love And Life On Lesbos With Margaret Mountford will be shown on BBC Four on May 6.","The Greek island was the 'sex tourism capital of the ancient Aegean'

"The naked body of a 22-year-old Michigan woman who went missing while dressed as Poison Ivy after a Halloween party was found on Friday and police say evidence indicates it was a homicide. The Monroe County Sheriff's Office confirmed on Saturday the remains found on a 13-acre private property near a heavily-wooded site close to train tracks are those of Chelsea Bruck. The medical examiner's office in Wayne County used dental records to confirm the body is Bruck's. Chelsea Bruck (left) was last seen in Frenchtown Township, Michigan, while dressed as Poison Ivy (right) Investigators and volunteers had been searching for Bruck  and more than one million fliers were handed out . She was last seen on October 26 about 15 miles away from where the body was discovered in Ash Township . Bruck, of Maybee, disappeared after attending the party in Newport on October 26, about 15 miles away from where her body was discovered Friday in Monroe County's Ash Township. She was dressed as the fictional comic villain  at the party and was wearing a leaf-covered top and a dark purple wig. Her body wasn't clothed when workers found it while trying to free a dump truck from soggy soil. Chelsea's older brother Nathaniel said in a post on the Help Find Chelsea Bruck Facebook page: 'I want to thank everyone for their efforts. 'And while this may be the end of the search, it is also a new beginning; the beginning of the search for justice for my sister.' Monroe County Sheriff Dale Malone spoke to the media during a conference about the discovery of the body . Monroe County Sheriff Dale Malone said evidence collected at the scene indicated the death was a homicide, although a cause of death remains inconclusive, the Monroe News reported. He did not say if the police have any leads, but did say the property owner is not a suspect, according to the Detroit Free Press. Malone said at a news conference: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the Bruck family. 'In all likelihood, the crime was committed at or near where the body was located.' He added the killer likely 'was familiar with the railroad tracks that are there'. Michigan State Police were called to investigate the area in Ash Township where the body was found Friday . The Poison Ivy costume was found about ten miles away at an industrial site near Flat Rock earlier this month. Investigators and volunteers had been searching for Bruck since she disappeared and more than one million fliers about the missing woman were distributed. A witness told police about seeing Bruck in her costume around 3am the day she vanished, walking in the direction of where cars were parked. A man was with her. He was described as having dark hair, a thin mustache and facial hair. Witnesses said he wore glasses with a black hoodie. The cause of death could take up to a month to be determined due to the advanced decomposition of the body. Family and friends turned to public prayer in Monroe, Michigan last October after Bruck first went missing .","Chelsea Bruck last seen on October 26 in Frenchtown Township, Michigan .

"The Nepal earthquake that has killed at least 2,500 people was a 'nightmare waiting to happen', disaster experts said last night. Just a week ago, 50 earthquake scientists from country the world met in the capital Kathmandu to discuss how the area would cope with such disaster. Resting on colliding tectonic plates, Nepal is under constant threat of earthquake of natural disaster. But experts claim its shoddy infrastructure and poor building standards make the country much less equipped to deal with the aftermath of major incidents. Scroll down for video . The United States Geological Survey said the quake struck 81 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 06.11 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside of their homes . On Sunday evening the death toll had crept up to 2,500 people across four countries, with hundreds still missing. Speaking of the Nepalese capital where the scientific meeting was held, one expert said it the devastation was 'an accident waiting to happen'. 'Physically and geologically what happened is exactly what we thought would happen,' said seismologist James Jackson, head of the earth sciences department at the Cambridge University. 'I was walking through that very area where that earthquake was and I thought at the very time that the area was heading for trouble,' said Mr Jackson, lead scientist for Earthquakes Without Frontiers, a group that tries to help Asian cities prepare for disasters. Locals rescued two more dust-covered men, pulling them up on the the street as they work to find and rescue any survivors of the disaster . Earthquakes of similar magnitude can have bigger effects on different parts of the globe because of the manner of building construction and population density. A 7.8 magnitude earthquake could kill 10 to 30 per one million residents in California, but has killed at least 1,900 in Nepal, and could kill up to 10,000 in parts of Pakistan, India, Iran and China, said U.S. Geological Survey seismologist David Wald. With the death toll steadily creeping up (to 2,500 on Sunday evening), the full extent of the horror brought by the earthquake is slowly unfolding. As rescuers scramble to save stranded climbers on Mount Everest where 18 died under avalanches yesterday, experts are warning the worst of the disaster is to come. Aftershocks rocked the Himalayan country this morning with residents describing the tremors in terrifying detail. One registered 6.9 on the Richter Scale and is feared to have triggered yet more avalanches on Everest. While the original earthquake's magnitude - 7.9 - labelled it a 'major' incident, it struck just 11km underground, making its effects all the more devastating. Coupled with that is its lack of preparation for such destructive tremors. A relatively poor country, its buildings are shoddily constructed and easily torn down. Experts also fear the earthquake's shallowness could have sparked landslides across the mountainous region. This is the fifth significant earthquake in Nepal in the last 205 years, including a massive one in 1934 that levelled the city. 'They knew they had a problem but it was so large they didn't where to start, how to start,' said Hari Ghi, south east Asia regional coordinator for Geohazards International, a group that calculates worldwide quake risks. Nepal was making progress on reducing its vulnerability to earthquakes, but not quickly or big enough. Mr Ghi's group, on April 12, updated a late 1990s report summarising the Kathmandu Valley risks. 'With an annual population growth rate of 6.5 per cent and one of the highest urban densities in the world, the 1.5 million people living in the Kathmandu Valley were clearly facing a serious and growing earthquake risk,' the report said, laying out 'the problem' the valley faces. 'It was also clear that the next large earthquake to strike near the Valley would cause significantly greater loss of life, structural damage, and economic hardship than past earthquakes had inflicted.' And for years there were no building codes and rampant development so homes and other structures could be built without any regards to earthquakes, the report said. There are now building codes, but that doesn't help the older structures, and the codes aren't overly strong, Mr Ghi said. It's actually even made worse because of local inheritance laws that require property be split equally among all sons, Mr Jackson said. 'So that means buildings are split vertically among brothers making very thin rickety homes that need more space so people add insecure living space on additional floors, he said. 'The construction is appalling in Kathmandu,' he said. Poverty and pollution make the problem worse. That's because people don't spend time worrying about some future earthquake because they have more pressing problems. 'If you live in the Kathmandu Valley you have other priorities, daily threats and daily nasty things happen to you in terms of air quality, water quality, pollution, traffic and just poverty,' Mr Jackson said. 'But it doesn't mean that the earthquakes go away.' Nepalese rescue teams remove a body from the rubble of the historic 19th century Darahara Tower in Kathmandu which collapsed in the quake . People search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building after the earthquake hit Nepal and surrounding countries at just after 6am GBT time . The earthquake had an epicentre 80 kilometres north-west of Kathmandu,according to United States Geological Survey and strong tremors were also felt in large areas of northern and eastern India and Bangladesh .

Panicked residents had rushed into the streets as the tremor erupted with the impact felt hundreds of miles away in big swathes of northern India and even in Bangladesh. Video footage showed people digging through the rubble of the bricks from the collapsed tower, looking for survivors. Nepal’s capital Kathmandu – with a population of over one million – was one of the worst-hit areas in Nepal, with the quake’s epicentre just 50 miles north of the city. As the tremors intensified, people were seen in scenes of mayhem running from their homes and places of work in panic. Source: U.S. Geological Survey. Data from 1990 onwards . Dozens of people were gathered in the car park of Kathmandu's Norvic International Hospital, where thin mattresses had been spread on the ground for patients rushed outside, some patients wearing hospital pyjamas, while doctors and nurses were treating people. The United States Geological Survey said the quake struck 81 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 06.11 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside of their homes. The 7.8 magnitude tremor was the worst to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years. Television footage showed a huge swathe of houses had collapsed in while roads had been split in two by the force of the impact. India was first to respond to Nepal's appeal for help by sending in military aircraft with medical equipment and relief teams. Britain has deployed a team of humanitarian experts to Nepal to provide urgent support for people affected by the quake, International Development Secretary Justine Greening announced tonight. Ms Greening said: 'My thoughts are with the people of Nepal, in particular all those who have lost loved ones. 'The absolute priority must be to reach people who are trapped and injured, and provide shelter and protection to those who have lost their homes. 'Nepal needs our urgent humanitarian assistance. That is why we have rapidly deployed a team of humanitarian experts who will immediately begin work assessing the damage and helping the Nepalese authorities respond to this devastating earthquake.' It came after Prime Minister David Cameron pledged that the UK would do all it can to help in the aftermath on the Nepal earthquake. On Twitter he said: 'Shocking news about the earthquake in Nepal - the UK will do all we can to help those caught up in it.' Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, added his condolences and said the British Embassy was providing help to any UK nationals caught up in the disaster. 'My thoughts are with the people of Nepal and everyone affected by the terrible loss of life and widespread damage caused by the earthquake,' he said. 'We are in close contact with the Nepalese government. The British Embassy in Nepal is offering our assistance to the authorities and is providing consular assistance to British Nationals.'","Earthquake experts met in Kathmandu last week to plan for similar disaster .

"They share the same side-swept fair hair and cheeky smile … and when they’re perched on steps wearing knee socks and pullovers decorated with Grenadier Guards, it’s royally difficult to tell these two little boys apart. But one is HRH Prince George of Cambridge, third in line to the throne and born into a life of palaces and privilege – while the other is plain old Tommy Cox from Colchester, Essex. Two-year-old Tommy’s mother – whose name, as it happens, is Kate – and father Paul, 41, are regularly stopped by people who want to have their photograph taken with the prince’s lookalike. Scroll down for video . Spot the difference: Essex boy Tommy Cox (left) and Prince George of Cambridge (right) look very similar . Mrs Cox, 35, a sales and marketing manager, first noticed the similarities between Tommy and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s son George when the prince was christened in October 2013. She said: ’Some of my friends who have little children had mentioned to me how Tommy looked like George and were saying how cute it was. ‘Then people started stopping me at the supermarket, and I realised it was more than just me being a biased mum.’ Keen royal watcher Mrs Cox is always keen to see each new photograph of George when it is released by his parents William and Kate to check if the two boys from very different worlds are continuing to grow up looking the same. She said: ‘They both have the same brown eyes and lovely, rosy, chubby cheeks and when Tommy's hair is in a side parting, it is uncanny how the two boys look so similar. ‘ . Tommy, who celebrated his second birthday on March 8, is slightly older than George, who will be two on July 22. Two-year-old Tommy’s mother – whose name is also Kate – is regularly stopped by people who want to have their photograph taken with the prince’s lookalike . A nation awaits: The real Prince George is due to become a big brother at any moment . Friends of Mrs Cox have suggested she should look into getting work for Tommy as a royal look-a-like, some of whom can earn up to £1,000 a day. But she is not keen - as she admits her son’s behaviour sometimes falls rather short of regal. She said: ‘I might look into it, but to be honest, Tommy does not follow orders too well. ‘I do call him my little prince sometimes but his behaviour is not that of a royal. ‘At nursery they describe him as 'busy' and he is always rushing around and exploring. He is very excitable.’ Mrs Cox added that her husband was not even aware of their son’s claim to fame. She said: ‘Paul is not a fan of the Royals so when his mum started telling him how Tommy looked like Prince George, he had to look for pictures of him to see what she was talking about.’ The real George, of course, is due to become a big brother at any moment – and in a very modern move, the birth will be formally announced on royal social media accounts before a notice is posted on the traditional easel outside Buckingham Palace.","Tommy Cox from Colchester looks just like Prince George of Cambridge .

"A married couple who have endured the heartbreak of ten miscarriages in ten years, have revealed the joy of becoming parents to their miracle daughter. Last year Sarah, 36, and Mark Brennan, 35, from south Wales, never gave up hope of becoming parents despite being told they'd never conceive naturally. Yet last September they defied doctors to have Eryn, who was born seven weeks early, weighing just 3lb 11oz. Sarah and Mark Brennan show off their longed-for daughter Eryn Elisabeth . Sarah, a project manager, said: 'We'd just been put on the waiting list for IVF, when I had an inkling I might be pregnant.' After feeling queasy and exhausted, she decided to take a pregnancy test, which confirmed that she was expecting. Mark, a technician, said: 'It was wonderful to find out that Sarah was pregnant, but after so many miscarriages, we could not help but worry.' The pair, who met when they were 18, were just about to jet off to Egypt for a holiday and quickly booked themselves in for a private scan. Mark said: 'It may sound strange, but after about six miscarriages, we just got used to it - to being let down every time.' During their holiday, Sarah continued to suffer from sickness and giddiness and went straight to the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend when they returned home. Project manager Sarah, pictured with her treasured daughter, advises other mums struggling with infertility to not give up . After telling the midwife their history they were referred to the sonographer and a scan revealed a heartbeat. 'We couldn't stop the tears - we were in pieces. We even had the sonographer in tears,' Sarah said. In the weeks that followed, the pair were told that their baby was developing well and found out at the 20-week scan that they were expecting a girl. Everything went smoothly until 29 weeks, when Sarah's waters broke so early, the doctors did not believe they had gone. She recalled: 'I was in a state of panic. But they hooked me up to machines to check her and, thank God, she was OK.' Sarah was told that she was experiencing Braxton Hicks - a tightening of the muscles in the womb - and sent home. The couple then spent the next few days in and out of hospital. 'Fear was creeping back into both of us,' she said. 'In fact, scared just isn't the word.' The doctors eventually confirmed that her waters had broken and she was sent to a specialist unit at Singleton Hospital in Swansea for close monitoring. After going into labour early, Sarah feared she'd lost Eryn and couldn't hold her newborn for five hours . 'I was in agony with the pain of every baby kick, stretch, minor movement or hiccup,' she said. Sarah spent the next two weeks in hospital, but did not go into labour and decided to go home. She eventually went into labour on September 30 and was booked in for an emergency Caesarean, as the baby was in the breech position. Eryn was born at 33 weeks at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend at 2.52pm, weighing just 3Ib 11oz. Sarah said: 'She let out a cry and we were in tears - we were finally parents. But instead of handing her to me, the midwife raced away because she needed help breathing. 'I didn't get to see her until five hours after she was born and the first cuddle, with wires and tubes, was not until the next day.' The couple decided to call their daughter Eryn Elisabeth. The couple said they became 'used' to the heartbreak of miscarriages after losing ten babies . Sarah said: 'I was handed Eryn, complete with tubes and wires, and I crumbled with a perfect rush of emotion and love.' Sarah was discharged from hospital, but Eryn had to stay in neonatal care for three weeks. 'It was terrifying to leave her,' she said. 'We spent all day by her cot and I was in tears every night.' The pair eventually returned to their home in Llantwit Major and Eryn is now growing well. Sarah said: 'We were so happy - I would say to anyone else who is going through the same thing - never give up hope.'","Sarah Brennan, 36, was on the IVF waiting list when she became pregnant .

"Doctors in Kurdistan are breaking the law by performing abortions on young Yazidi girls who have been released after being held as sex slaves by ISIS fighters. Traumatised after months of rape and torture at the hands of ISIS militants, some of victims have returned after falling pregnant by their captors and further at risk at being ostracised by their community, which frowns upon pre-marital sex. Now, some Kurdish doctors are allegedly performing illegal abortions and secret surgeries to 'reverse loss of virginity' on the victims, some of whom are as young as eight, the Sunday Times reports. Scroll down for video . Hundreds of Yazidi girls and women, some as young as eight, were kidnapped by ISIS last year, and have since been held as sex slaves in the Islamic State . Horrifying tale: This 15-year-old Yazidi girl is one of hundreds of former ISIS sex slaves who have managed to escape the Islamic State and now face the difficult task of re-entering the strict religious community . The young girls, some barely teenagers, are some of around 40,000 people kidnapped at gunpoint when Islamic State fighters attacked Yazidi villages last summer. The women who have escaped now face being shunned by their strict religious communities, and many are erase to hide the physical evidence of their time in captivity, Hala Jaber writes in the Sunday Times. Some Yazidi girls are secretly undergoing abortions, banned in Kurdistan even in cases of rape, and seeking hymen surgery to 'reverse the loss of virginity'. A recent study by Human Rights watch has found that ISIS fighters have been kidnapping women and children as young as eight, forcing them to marry and convert to Islam and raping them repeatedly. Around 40,000 people were kidnapped at gunpoint when Islamic State fighters attacked Yazidi villages last summer. Yazidi women and girls have been separated from their families, forced to convert to Islam and repeatedly raped by ISIS fighters, the study from Human Rights Watch says. Their actions amount to war crimes. it adds . The names of Yazidi women were selected from a lottery for men to rape, a survivor told the charity . Yazidi children as young as eight have been abducted from their homes in northern Iraq, raped by ISIS fighters and forced into marriage. One child interviewed said she was 'owned' and raped by seven different men . Hundreds have been able to return, either by fleeing or being set free by ISIS, and many young women who has been held as sex slaves. Their terrifying campaign of systematic rape was tantamount to war crimes - and possibly crimes against humanity, the report adds. Human Rights Watch has collected the accounts of 20 women and girls who escaped from ISIS, which they say shows a system of organised rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery and forced marriage – acts that constitute war crimes. Now they are urging that survivors get the medical and psychological treatment that they need to cope with the unimaginable trauma they suffered. A 31-year-old Yazidi woman named Rashida told the charity she was told by her brother to commit suicide if she was unable to escape the ISIS fighters who had captured her. ‘Later that day they made a lottery of our names and started to choose women by drawing out the names', the 31-year-old said. ‘The man who selected me, Abu Ghufran, forced me to bathe but while I was in the bathroom I tried to kill myself. ‘I had found some poison in the house, and took it with me to the bathroom. I knew it was toxic because of its smell. ‘I distributed it to the rest of the girls and we each mixed some with water in the bathroom and drank it. None of us died but we all got sick.’ Rape and other forms of sexual violence committed during an armed conflict violate the laws of war. These women were part of a group of 216 Yazidis who were recently released by ISIS after being captured last year . Another woman, identified as Dilara, said she was taken to a wedding hall in Syria where ISIS fighters told the group to forget their relatives and prepare to marry them and bear their children. From 9:30am in the morning, men would come to buy girls to rape them. The survivors' stories come as United Nations (UN) investigators found evidence ISIS are committing genocide against the Yazidi minority in Iraq. The human rights office published a horrifying report in March describing killings, torture, rape, sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers by the extremists. It suggested they may be guilty of 'war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide'. The report, based on interviews with more than 100 witnesses and survivors between June 2014 and February 2015, highlights brutal ISIS attacks on the Yazidis. The jihadists consistently separated out men and boys over the age of 14 to be executed, according to investigators. Younger boys were forced to become child soldiers and women and girls were abducted as the 'spoils of war'. Head of the investigation Suki Nagra said: 'These attacks were aimed at destroying the Yazidi as a group.' She added that ISIS was guilty of 'genocide' against the minority. She told Human Rights Watch: 'I saw in front of my eyes ISIS soldiers pulling hair, beating girls, and slamming the heads of anyone who resisted. 'They were like animals…. Once they took the girls out, they would rape them and bring them back to exchange for new girls. The girls’ ages ranged from eight to 30 years… only 20 girls remained in the end.' This comes just weeks after the release of 216 Yazidi prisoners who had been held captive since last summer when ISIS militants attacked their villages in the area around Sinjar in northwestern Iraq. The freed prisoners said that they had been led to believe they were being led to their execution, but instead, were piled onto a minibus that drove them to peshmerga positions. It was not clear why the radical jihadists had decided to release the Yazidis, whom they consider devil-worshippers, but the group previously freed 200 more it was holding under similarly mysterious circumstances. Yazidi activists say many remain in the hands of Islamic State, which has often subjected women to rape or sexual slavery. The United Nations said last month that the Islamic State may have committed genocide against the minority. The Yazidis are an ancient, predominantly Kurdish, people who follow their own religion derived from Islam, Christianity and Zoroastrianism.","Hundreds of Yazidi girls and women held as sex slaves in Islamic State .

"A second person is dead after a body was found in Alabama waters following a powerful storm that capsized several sailboats participating in a regatta near Mobile Bay. Major Steve Thompson with the Alabama Department of Public Safety's Marine Patrol Division said that one person was found dead on Saturday and a second was found dead on Sunday morning. During a press conference on Sunday, authorities also said crews still are searching for five people missing in the water following the Dauphin Island regatta on Saturday - which included more than 100 sailboats and as many as 200 people. Not all of the missing people were participating in the 57th annual regatta, according to authorities, and names of the missing and deceased were not released on Sunday. Scroll down for video . A second person is dead and five are missing following a powerful storm that capsized several sailboats in a regatta near Mobile Bay, Alabama on Saturday (above footage taken by someone on a boat during the storm) The regatta included more than 100 sailboats and as many as 200 people (above a camera captures a passing sailboat trying to get through the big waves during the storm) Coast Guard Capt. Duke Walker told AL.com that ten vessels were capsized or incapacitated during the storm with three of those with the regatta. Walker also said crews are using boats and airplanes to search vast portions of the bay, including the center and areas close to Dauphin Island where family members have gathered. The storm rolled through the area about 4pm and a man was plucked from the waters by the Coast Guard around 9pm, Petty officer Carlos Vega said. Families of those missing stayed overnight in a makeshift shelter hoping that on Sunday morning they would be reunited with their loved ones, according to AL.com. Survivor Robert Luiten was a member of a five-person crew with also his  18-year-old son, Lennerd when they were thrown into the bay after the storm hit. He and another crew member were rescued quickly, but he told AL.com that it took around six hours until his son was found by rescuers. Late Saturday, the pair were reunited however two of their crew were still unaccounted for.

Kevin Maurin (above), 28, president of the Dauphin Island Fishing Rodeo who was caught in the middle of the storm with his eight-person crew, said as soon as they let the sails drop 'freaking hell broke loose' Randy Rutledge and Rhonda Morgan Gilreath of Rome, Georgia were 15 minutes from the 18-mile race's finish when the storm hit. They were left in the water for two hours before being rescued and their boat sank in the storm's aftermath. 'It was just unbelievable how high the waves were,' Gilreath told AL.com. 'They were just bashing you from every side.' 'We knew we were totally lost at sea, we did,' she continued. The storm also caused a loss of power to 23,000 residents in coastal Alabama and Dauhpin Island Park remained dark into Saturday evening, according to AL.com. Footage of what appears to be a group of five on a sailboat during the storm was posted to YouTube showing big crashing waves and strong winds.

'They were scattered anywhere from Dauphin Island Bridge all the way out into Mobile Bay and across to Fort Morgan. It was a wide area,' said Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier . He told AL.com that race officials had cancelled the regatta before moving forward with it after an hour-delay. While he and his eight-person crew were enjoying the race, he said out of nowhere the storm hit and in a quick-thinking move that likely saved them from ending up in the water, the captain ordered the boat's two sails to be lowered. 'It was a great day, everybody on the boat was having fun,' Maurin told AL.com. 'All of a sudden, within seconds, boom.' 'As soon as they [sails] dropped, freaking hell broke loose,' he continued. 'I was in the middle of it and it was terrible.' On Saturday, Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier told Al.com  that one person was confirmed dead, but he did not know the cause.

Susan Kangal, who was on a boat, told WSFA it was the worst storm that she has seen. 'We were probably an inch from capsizing; everybody was ready to jump. I didn't have a life jacket on,' she said. The boats were part of the 57th iteration of the race. 'Apparently there were a number of vessels that became distressed, either capsized or what have you,' the mayor said. 'They were scattered anywhere from Dauphin Island Bridge all the way out into Mobile Bay and across to Fort Morgan. It was a wide area,' said Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier.

He said that they expected thunderstorms but not as severe as they were. 'But we were not prepared for a gale,' Mather said, 'which is almost like a 30-minute hurricane.' Mather was not in the race and was able to pull three people onto his vessel about two miles north of the Dauphin Island Bridge. He said the boaters seemed extremely tired but none of them were injured. 'They were exhausted but they were fine,' he said.

"A southern New Jersey woman jailed in an international custody dispute has been freed after spending more than eight years behind bars and is likely to be reunited with her daughter who's been without either parent for nearly a decade. María Jose Carrascosa, a 49-year-old native of Spain, was released from jail Friday night, The Record reported. Carrascosa, formerly of Fort Lee, was paroled last year after moving her daughter, then 5, to Spain when the girl's father, Peter Innes, was granted custody of the child. Freed: María Jose Carrascosa was released from a New Jersey jail on Friday after spending nearly 9 years behind bars for refusing to return her daughter to the United States . Defiant: Carrascosa defiantly refused to bring her daughter back to the United States and thus remained jailed nearly nine years . Once paroled, Carrascosa was taken to the Bergen County Jail for contempt of court for violating a court order to bring the child back. Her release came in part thanks to a letter written to the court by Peter Innes. Superior Court Judge Bonnie Mizdol, ultimately deciding that incarceration would not coerce Carrascosa to comply with child custody orders, ordered her release from jail Friday. Jail time for contempt of court is meant to coerce a person into cooperating with a judges orders, not as a punishment. However, Carrascosa defiantly refused to bring her daughter back to the United States and thus remained jailed. 'The question before this court is whether incarceration has lost its coercive power and has become punitive,' Judge Mizdol said. 'It has become clear that continued incarceration would not compel her to return her daughter, so it would be deemed punitive.' During the hearing, the judge read a letter from Innes, of Hasbrouck Heights, that said he would not oppose Carrascosa's release if she returns to Spain to be with their daughter, Victoria. The judge also read a letter from Victoria, who is now 14, that said: 'My only wish is to be with my mother.' Tearful reunion: Carrascosa had a tearful reunion with her daughter via Skype following her release and says she plans to return to Spain as soon as possible . Finally: Carrascosa's release came after her daughter and estranged husband wrote letters to the court urging a judge to set her free . Dear Victoria, . This is what you've been asking for and I am happy for you this day has finally come. You should know that I did all I could, including petitioning the judge, to help get your mom released. I did this so she can return to you in Spain. Please know, you mom is completely free to immediately leave the United States and return to Spain. I truly hope she is with you tomorrow. For me, this conflict is over. I wish you and your family well and I hope you enjoy your reunion with your mother. I will always be here for you when the time comes that you want to hear the truth as I know it. Love, . Dad . Source: VictoriaInnes.com . Pictured here at the start of their marriage, Peter Innes and María Jose Carrascosa would end the union with a bitter divorce and battle over their daughter. Last week, Innes relented and chose to give his daughter what she wanted--her mother back . 'I am glad it is over and she is out,' Peter Innes told the The Record. 'I just hope she is on her way home to see our daughter.' Carrascosa moved her daughter to Spain but continued the custody dispute in New Jersey when she was arrested in 2006. When a Family Court judge in Bergen County ordered her to bring the child back within 10 days or go to jail, Carrascosa refused, declaring that she would rather die in jail than bring her daughter back to New Jersey. Carrascosa was convicted in 2009 of willful interference with child custody, which resulted in the prison sentence. Footage taken following her release Friday by Spanish language station RTVE.es shows Carrascosa sharing a tearful reunion via Skype with her 14-year-old daughter. Carrascosa told reporters she intends to return to her native Spain, where in the last several years the case has gained widespread media attention and demands for her release, as soon as possible. 'My idea is to return to Spain, to reunite with my daughter and my parents, and there, God will provide,' Carrascosa told reporters, though she said the arrangements for her return could take months of unraveling delicate legal issues. Mr. Innes did not attend the hearing and says his daughter has not spoken to him for several years. he told The Record that he's reached out to Victoria, who lives in Valencia, via email several times but has not received any response. 'My idea is to return to Spain, to reunite with my daughter and my parents, and there, God will provide,' Carrascosa told reporters in an interview that followed her release . Innes runs a website named after his daughter in which he's laid out his side of the drawn-out dispute. On the site, Innes claims his ex-wife, an attorney by training, is a shady businesswoman with a habit of slandering him to anyone who will listen. Innes even suggests Carrascosa is mentally ill in addition to being an outright snob. He writes: . 'Her erratic and often delusional behavior suggest she suffers from psychiatric problems, . 'She and her elitist and wealthy European family consider themselves above such ""common people"" like the Innes family and above the laws of the United States.' However, even Innes seems to have come around on the issue of his ex-wife's incarceration. In his letter to the court, he stipulated that he was unopposed to her release so long as she returns immediately to Spain to be with their daughter. Innes has updated his site since Friday to reflect his ex-wife's release with a letter to Victoria explaining his role in the release.","Spanish national María Jose Carrascosa, 49, was jailed in 2006 after refusing to return her daughter to the custody of her father in New Jersey .

"Defeated: Napoleon (illustrated) lost at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 . Guests attending a service in London to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo have been told not to act in a 'triumphalist' way – to avoid upsetting the French. Invitations to the service at St Paul's Cathedral advise that it will avoid glorifying the Duke of Wellington's historic victory over Napoleon in 1815. But last night the move was criticised by politicians, who said it 'took political correctness to an absurd new degree'. The invitation to the Waterloo 200 event says: 'The service, although related to a military victory, is not in any way glorifying war, nor must it be seen as triumphalist.' Instead, the service – to be attended by members of the Royal Family and senior political and military figures – will focus on the 'pan-European' implications of the battle and the century of peace that followed. Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is bidding to be re-elected as a Somerset MP, said: 'Waterloo was a triumph of good versus evil. Napoleon was responsible for between three million and 6.5 million deaths. 'Two hundred years on, it is ridiculous to spare the blushes of the French by not celebrating the battle for what it was. What next? Will we ask France to apologise for the Battle of Hastings?' The service of commemoration, to take place on the 200th anniversary of Waterloo on June 18, will be the centrepiece of a series of events to mark the battle. Waterloo 200 chairman, Major General Sir Evelyn Webb-Carter, defended the 'no triumphalism' theme. Asked if it looked as though the service was designed to avoid embarrassing the French, he said: 'Some people may read it like that but it's not how we look at it.' He added that the enemy at Waterloo was Napoleon – not France as such. The commemoration was highlighting the effect of the battle on Europe, not the military campaign or the battle itself. 'What Waterloo brought in was an extended period of peace in Europe after a particularly horrible 20 years of war,' Sir Evelyn said. 'The commemoration looks forward to the European harmony that followed it.' Colin Brown, author of Scum Of The Earth, a new book about Waterloo, said Wellington would not have objected to the non-triumphalist tone. He added: 'The Duke strongly believed in the restoration of the status quo after the battle, including the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France.' The commemoration was highlighting the effect of the battle (illustrated) on Europe, organisers said .","Guests attending Battle of Waterloo anniversary service told not to gloat .

"$2 million worth of stolen artwork has been found in a caretakers garage after disappearing from the walls of an inner-city Sydney penthouse. Three years after the theft, police were investigating a car syndicate and executed a search warrant on a Wiley Park property. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, in a discovery described as 'quite remarkable' by police, all of the paintings along with three stolen luxury cars were found. $2 million worth of stolen artwork has been found in a caretakers garage after disappearing from Sydney home .

"The brother of Australia's most notorious serial killer has confessed to knowing of his evil sibling's first victim - and to hiding the truth for 50 years as the 'wrong man' was convicted and behind bars. Boris Milat detailed how his brother, Ivan, shot and paralysed a taxi driver in 1962, more then 25 years before he went on a backpacker killing spree, according to Channel 7's Sunday Night. Neville Knight was shot on March 6, 1962, by a 17-year-old Milat who was riding in the back of his taxi. Scroll down for video . A new report claims Ivan Milat, Australia's most notorious serial killer, could have been caught before he murdered seven backpackers . Mr Milat confessed the shooting was his murderous brother's first violent crime, despite police never once considering him a suspect. 'Ivan shot him - he told me the next day,' Mr Milat told the program. 'His intentions were to rob the driver of his takings. The gun had a hair-trigger... the gun went off. 'The bloke straight away knew he had lost everything in his bottom end. 'You know, his legs ... feelings. He knew it went through his back. He knew he was ... Ivan had paralysed him. 'He (Ivan) got out of the cab and ran.' Alan Dillon was convicted for the shooting and spent five years behind bars. Dillon even confessed to the crime, in an attempt to protect his own brother. Boris Milat told the program a secret about his brother he had kept for more than 52 years . Milat was later sentenced to life in prison, but if the 'wrong man' (right) had not been jailed for his first crime, Milat's victims could have been saved, the program claims . 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man imprisoned for Milat's first violent crime, Alan Dillon (right), told the killer's brother, Boris (left) 'They were asking me questions and getting me to sign things,' Dillon told the program when explaining why he confessed to a crime he didn't commit. He said he believed police were going to charge his younger brother for the crime, and confessed to protect him. In the years since, he had always believed the reason for his confession was true, until the program contacted him with its theory. According to claims made by the program, Milat was 17 years old when he shot his first victim, Neville Knight . The daughter of Milat's first victim, Deborah Hutton, was told her father was shot by the serial killer . The report claims Milat's seven victims could have been saved if he had been been held accountable for this first chilling crime . Mr Milat said he also lied to protect a brother, but was confessing to bring closure to Dillon. 'Ivan said they were blaming someone else,' he told Sunday Night. 'I didn't think it was good but I didn't want to see him go to jail either, you know, I didn't want to see him harmed. 'But I want to bring closure to the other man, that's why I'm talking. 'Ivan shot this bloke in the back.' Forensic psychiatrist Dr Julian Parmegiani told Sunday Night it was possible Milat set out to paralyse Mr Knight. The horrific intent was shown in his later crimes, where he paralysed many of his victims before they were murdered. Superintendent Clive Small led the investigation into the backpacker murders and now also believes Milat is responsible for the shooting of Knight more than 50 years ago. 'A number of the victims, most of the victims, had multiple stab wounds to the back, around the spinal area, which suggested he was trying to paralyse them while keeping them alive,' Small said. British backpacker Caroline Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head when police found her body . The program also puts Mr Milat face-to-face with the 'wrong man', who was jailed for the first crime his brother committed. 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' Dillon told Mr Milat, as the pair shook hands. Mr Milat told Dillon: 'you've been on me mind a lot'. Mr Knight's daughter, Deborah Hutton, was also unaware her 'courageous' father was Milat's first victim. First victims: Australians James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both aged 19, were Ivan Milat's first known victims after they disappeared in December 1989 and their bodies were found in the Belanglo State forest almost four years later . Simone Schmidl's body was found in November 1993. She had been stabbed to death . Ms Hutton said it was confronting to be told Milat may have shot her father. 'If Dad was the first attempted 'thrill kill'... how horrified can anyone be?' she said. Mr Knight went on to become an advocate for the rights of people with disabilities before he died in 1998. Mr Milat said he hopes his confession can help ease the pain of people impacted by his brother's crimes, and he thought about the first incident 'all the time'. Boyfriend and girlfriend German backpackers Gabor Neugebauer and Anja Habschied were found dead on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart . British backpacker Joanne Walters, is another one of the victims of backpacker murderer Ivan Milat . 'I thought about it... 'how the hell do I fix that'?' he told the program. 'It was a monkey on my back - I had to get rid of it. 'It's not about the victims... it's about the families. The main object of the thing is bringing closure to the other man.' According to the timeline presented by the program and Mr Milat, his murderous brother would have been a 17-year-old when he claimed his first victim. Sinister souvenir: In this photograph police seized from the house of Ivan Milat's brother William, the serial killer is seen carrying the sleeping bag which belonged to Deborah Everist who with boyfriend Jame Gibson was the first of Milat's victims killed in the Belanglo State Forest . Milat, 70, was convicted of butchering seven young people between 1989 and 1992 and burying their bodies in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW. He has been locked up in Goulburn's Supermax jail for almost 20 years. The first two bodies of Milat's victims were discovered on September 19 and 20 1992, when two runners found a decaying corpse in the Belanglo State Forest. Police later confirmed the bodies were of missing British backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters. Walters had been stabbed 35 times and Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head. Australia's worst serial killer Ivan Milat kept trophies to remind him of each murder . Milat butchered and buried the bodies of seven young people between 1989 and 1992 in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW . The grim finds were just the beginning of a long and extensive search which resulted in the bodies of Australians Deborah Everist and James Gibson being found in October 1993, followed by Simone Schmidl's stabbed body in November of the same year. The decapitated body of German backpacker Anja Habschied was then found along with her boyfriend Gabor Neugebauer on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart. Milat was convicted of the seven backpacker murders on July 27, 1996 and for the attempted murder, false imprisonment and robbery of Paul Onions. He kept the shirts, sleeping bags, a water bottle, portable stove and backpacks of his victims hidden in roof and wall cavities, in what was described as an 'Aladdin's Cave', in the house he was arrested in 20 years ago.","Report claims Ivan Milat shot first victim years before backpacker murders .

"A Michigan father convicted of abusing his then-11-week-old daughter who might lose parental rights to his only child claims his baby was never abused. Joshua Quincy Burns, formerly of Brighton, was sentenced to three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse earlier this month. Joshua Burns and and his wife, Brenda Burns, say he is innocent, and that he grabbed their daughter Naomi's face when she slipped from his lap as he ended a phone call with his wife in March 2014. He claims he was trying to save her from hitting her head on a coffee table in their home. His now-one-year-old daughter suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages. But the couple call it 'an accident', not child abuse. Scroll down for video . Joshua Burns (right) was sentenced to three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse after his daughter Naomi (in his arms) suffered several injuries. He and his wife Brenda Burns (left) maintain Joshua Burns's innocence . Brenda Burns has refused to allow social workers and Michigan's Department of Human Services to see Naomi, according to the Livingston Daily. She was not charged criminally in the case, and a civil jury - when the state was seeking to end parental rights - found Brenda Burns not accountable for Naomi's injuries. The couple started a website called TornFamily in hopes of raising awareness of their situation and reunite their family. They will also be sharing their story on an episode of Dr Phil on Monday, and Joshua Burns maintains his innocence throughout the episode. 'I never abused my daughter,' he claims in the preview for the show. Joshua Burns claims he never abused little Naomi, and she suffered injuries after she slipped off his lap while he was ending a phone call with his wife and in an attempt to save his daughter from hitting her head on a coffee table he grabbed her by the face . Brenda Burns (right) has fled from Michigan to Colorado with Naomi in an attempt to escape being watched by DHS. Their oversight has been put on hold until a June hearing where Joshua Burns's parental rights will be determined . After the incident, baby Naomi suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages . 'Then why are you in jail?' Dr Phil asks in return. Brenda Burns claims that a Child Protective Services worker and five police officers entered their home and searched her house when the incident occurred. 'I literally thought: Do you have the right family?' she said to Dr Phil. Brenda Burns's attorney Elizabeth Warner said that the mother has the right to not be monitored by the government, and 'certainly not by the agency that takes children' because she was not held responsible for the injuries and is seen as 'the fit parent' Earlier this month, Judge Miriam Cavanaugh said the DHS's supervision of Naomi would continue but is on hold pending the decision as to whether or not Joshua Burns will continue to have parental rights, according to the Free Press. Joshua Burns continues to claim he's innocent. In an episode of Dr Phil airing Monday, he says, 'I never abused my daughter' Even though her husband has been jailed, Brenda Burns supports her husband and agrees that the incident was 'an accident', not child abuse . Brenda Burns fled to Colorado to avoid being watched DHS, which she believes is unconstitutional. Naomi's court-appointed attorney has reportedly seen the child and says told the Livingston County Circuit Court that the baby is doing well. Warner, Brenda Burns's attorney, said that Naomi is 'doing very well' and that 'she's pretty advanced for her age'. She said: 'You can see pictures of a sick child with tubes in them and think she's going to be brain damaged forever. 'In fact, if this was a misdiagnosis as we think it was, I think the fact Naomi is so well really supports the parents' position this wasn't abuse. It was a misdiagnoses by a doctor. 'It's something she recovered from.' The hearing over the potential termination of Joshua Burns's parental rights is in June.

"A bartender and model has filed a civil lawsuit against the police, claiming officers used excessive force during her arrest when they slammed her to the ground, breaking four bones in her face. Megan Sheehan, of San Francisco, said that camera footage of Bay Area Rapid Transit officers and Oakland Police conflict with what police say happened the night she was knocked unconscious at Santa Rita Jail. She had been arrested and booked at the Santa Rita Jail for suspicion of resisting arrest, battery on a police officer and public intoxication on St. Patrick's Day of 2014. Megan Sheehan, of San Francisco, was knocked unconscious and suffered broken facial bones and cracked teeth after police took her to ground at Santa Rita Jail . Sheehan claims that camera footage of Bay Area Rapid Transit officers and Oakland Police conflict with what police say happened - that she was guided to the ground after 'violently punching' Security and body camera footage shows Sheehan being booked into the jail after a night of heavy drinking when two officers grab Sheehan's arms and slam her to the ground. Sheehan, who said she's psychologically still recovering from the attack, suffered severe facial injuries and was left bloodied, lying on the ground after the incident. She said that she is embarrassed with how drunk she was the night she was arrested, but that didn't warrant the force the police used. 'I should have never gotten that drunk, but also there are ways to detain someone and not break their face,' she told ABC. Sheehan was arrested by a BART officer, which she said she deserved because she was being drunk and belligerent. She was intoxicated, 'verbally argumentative' and didn't appear to be able to take care of herself, BART Police who found her sitting on a bench inside a station said, according to SF Gate. In the right side of the video frame, Sheehan can be seen being grabbed by two officers who take her to the ground. She then loses consciousness and police call for medical assistance . As Sheehan lies unconscious in a pool of her own blood, medical staff and an officer try to tend to her injuries. Medical staff were called after a woman behind the jail counter asked if Sheehan was 'down', and officers told her 'you might want medical', according to body camera footage . She had to be taken to the ground to be handcuffed and she hit an officer in the shoulder as well as kicked him in the face, police said. She was booked on resisting arrest, battery on a police officer and public intoxication. Sheehan was taken to Santa Rita jail in Dublin, where her handcuffs were removed so she could remove her jewelry. She was 'initially compliant', but after she was told she couldn't bring a hair tie into the jail, she threw it at one of the officers. She then 'inexplicably' started looking through her purse and didn't stop when asked to do so, BART police said. Officer Nolan Pianta put her in an 'arm bar control hold to gain compliance', but she resisted and tried 'violently punching', the police report said. Sheehan said she is embarrassed by how drunk she got the night of the incident and that she deserved to be arrested. But she added that her drunkenness shouldn't warrant the police to be as forceful as they were . Sheehan, a bartender and model, filed her lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. She names BART and Officer Pianta as defendants . She was then 'guided' to the ground by BART and Oakland Police officers, the report said. But Sheehan claims she was forcefully slammed to the ground and left severely injured. Surveillance footage shows Sheehan being grabbed by two officers and being taken to the ground head first. She lost consciousness, suffered four broken cheek bones, a split molar and a cracked front tooth, according to SF Gate. 'They knew by throwing her to the ground without having her hands available to break the fall, that she was going to suffer serious head injuries,' Sheehan's attorney John Scott told ABC. He added that she was uncooperative, and that he believes the excessive force was intentional. Sheehan was arrested by BART officers in a transit station on St Patrick's Day of 2014. She booked into the jail for suspicion of resisting arrest, battery on a police officer and public intoxication after a night of heavy drinking . Sheehan said it took her a long time to recover from her injuries physically, and psychologically, she still has yet to fully recover . 'In police jargon, she flunked the attitude test,' Scott said, claiming that Sheehan was being 'taught a lesson'. Sheehan was treated by nurses in the station and was taken to the hospital. She said it look a long time to recover physically and she is still recovering psychologically. She is seeking unspecified damages in her suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. She names BART and Pianta as defendants. Attorneys for BART said in court papers that no wrongdoing occurred and that Sheehan was partially responsible for the injuries she sustained. Sheehan was treated by nurses at the jail before she was taken to the hospital. She suffered four broken cheek bones, a split molar and a cracked front tooth .","WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES .

"A Washington woman was arrested after allegedly striking a five-year-old boy with her truck before hiding from officers by crawling into a hole and covering herself with dirt. The scent of Marsha Yumi Perry, 36, was tracked through a field by a Washougal police dog on Friday, who stopped within five feet of the hole she was hiding in, according to police. After Officer Kyle Day, who could not see her, warned he was about to unleash the dog, 'the ground moved, and she sat up,' Washougal Sgt. Geoff Reijonen told Oregon Live. Police said the boy suffered a cut to his face as well as scrapes to his knees and elbows, and he was taken to PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center in Vancouver. Marsha Yumi Perry (above), 36, was arrested on Friday on accusations of felony hit-and-run, driving with a suspended license and on a misdemeanor warrant after she allegedly struck a five-year-old boy with her car . Following the incident, Perry was taken into custody on accusations of felony hit-and-run, driving with a suspended license and on a misdemeanor warrant, and was taken to Clark County Jail. On Friday, authorities were called after the boy rode a tricycle out of a driveway when he was hit by a car around 6pm. Witnesses told police Perry tried to drive off but when she was unable to she got out of her Ford pickup truck and walked toward Washougal River Road, according to Oregon Live. Police dog, Ranger, was able to track her scent near the shallow hole she was hiding in before she gave herself up after warnings to reveal herself before the dog was unleashed, Reijonen said.

Previously, she was arrested in Oregon in November 2014 on accusations of identity theft, being in possession of methamphetamine and providing false information to police, according to Oregon Live. The case is still pending and she pleaded not guilty. Following Friday's incident, police do not believe drugs or alcohol were involved and the investigation is ongoing.

"The man named as a person of interest in the disappearance of William Tyrrell was living with three young boys at the time the toddler vanished - despite authorities being aware of allegations he raped two young girls in 1987. The New South Wales Ombudsman is investigating how Bill Spedding, 63, who has been charged with five counts of child sexual assault and two counts of common assault, was able to live with children despite claims being made against him. The mother of the three young boys, who cannot be named, was shocked to discover that the children had been living with a man accused of child abuse. 'Someone... needs to be held accountable,' she told The Australian. Scroll down for video . Bill Spedding was arrested and charged on Wednesday for the sexual assault of two girls  in Sydney in 1987 . The boys' grandfather told the newspaper: 'I am very concerned about what may have happened to my grandchildren.' During a short hearing on Thursday, a court heard Spedding raped two girls aged six and three in a caravan repeatedly nearly 30 years ago. Case notes held by the NSW Department of Family and Community Services detail the allegations of abuse, court documents show. While the Ombudsman confirmed it will be 'making inquires' into the accused sex offender's living situation, police are expected to lay more charges against Spedding and his alleged involvement in a paedophile ring. 'Investigations are continuing concerning such matters and it is anticipated further charges will brought against the accused in the foreseeable future,' the police fact sheet states, according to SMH. Spedding has denied any involvement in the disappearance of William, who was three years old when he vanished from his grandmother's Kendall home in September as played, dressed in his favourite Spiderman costume. The 63-year-old was a person of interest in the case of missing toddler William Tyrrell . Police emphasise the charges against Spedding are unrelated to the case of missing boy William Tyrrell, who disappeared from Kendall in NSW's mid north coast on September 12 last year. The disturbing historical crimes emerged after the washing machine repairman became a person of interest in the ongoing search for the three-year-old. Police will allege that, during a weekend in 1987, a three year old girl was sexually penetrated four times and assaulted in a caravan, according to the Daily Telegraph. Spedding was staying in a caravan on a property in Campbelltown in Sydney's west which was reportedly owned by his friend. In a victim statement the child, now aged in her 30s, claims she was either thrown against a wall or off the bed when she woke to found herself being raped. Margaret Spedding was pictured leaving Port Macquarie court on Thursday after her husband was refused bail . Detectives stressed that Spedding's arrest wasn't related to the four-year-old's disappearance . Court documents reveal that the mother and grandmother of the victim recall the three-year-old being greatly troubled by pain in her vagina and telling them that 'Bill did it', according to SMH. She was 'ill and continually vomiting' the following day and had 'extensive, black coloured bruising to her vagina and legs', according to the Daily Telegraph. At the time, the child sex assault unit at Westmead Hospital assessed the two children and determined that the three-year-old had been sexually penetrated in a number of ways. The six-year-old's injuries were also ruled to have been caused by penetration. Spedding's lawyer Robert Hoyles said the accused is adamant he is innocent and has done nothing wrong. 'One might say Mr Spedding will deny these allegations until his final breath,' Mr Hoyles said. Mr Spedding refused to take part in a formal interview at Port Macquarie police station on Wednesday night, according to SMH. This comes as police returned to the 63-year-old's home on Monday for a third time this year after it was unveiled that he was due to fix William's grandmother's washing machine around the time the boy vanished . Spedding was arrested at his Bonny Hills home on the NSW mid-north coast at about 1.30pm on Wednesday . The court heard Spedding denied the claims when police initially put them to him in the 1980s. The case is only as strong as it was in 1987, Mr Hoyles said. He argued that to detain a man with no criminal record for such an historical matter when a trial was up to a year away would be a great injustice. However, the magistrate found Spedding had not shown cause as to why detention was unjustified given the serious nature of the offences and Spedding was denied bail. Despite the obscenity of the charges, Spedding’s wife Margaret supported him in court and they pressed their hands against the glass when he was refused bail, according to SMH. Mr Spedding applied for bail on Thursday but it was refused by Magistrate Thomas Hodgson. He will next appear in court on June 18. The 63-year-old was arrested at his Bonny Hills home on the NSW mid-north coast on Wednesday after five detectives descended on his property. His wife Margaret was in court as Spedding made his bid for bail. Spedding is believed to have said 'no' when five detectives asked him to go with them in the unmarked police car on Wednesday, Fairfax reported. While Spedding's wife, Margaret, was seen yelling at reporters during the arrest at their home. Just hours earlier, it was revealed that William's grandmother asked Spedding, a few days before her grandson disappeared from her garden, to fix her washing machine because she was expecting her family to stay over, The Daily Telegraph reported. This contradicts reports that her family's visit was unexpected. Spedding is believed to have said 'no' when five detectives asked him to go with them in the unmarked police car . Spedding was due to fix William's grandmother's washing machine around the time the boy vanished. This week investigators visited Spedding's home for the third time this year before his arrest. It comes after police revealed they believe William may be alive, despite fears that he was abducted by a paedophile ring operating on the mid-north coast of NSW. Investigators believe the boy was snatched during a very short window of time when he was out of sight of his family as he played outside . Police have visited Spedding's home three other times this year after becoming a person of interest in the case of the missing toddler . The parents of the missing three-year-old released new pictures of their son and a video pleading for his return by abductors who are believed to have snatched him in broad daylight last September . Investigators believe he was snatched during a very short window of time when he was out of sight of his family as he played outside. The parents have urged anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers immediately on 1800 333 000. The release of the video comes more than a month since police scoured bushland in Bonny Hills, south of Port Macquarie, for evidence relating to William's whereabouts. Police divers were brought in from Sydney to search a murky dam in a bush reserve and a nearby swamp, after more than 30 officers and the dog squad had spent spent two days searching through dense bushland - including along a track that can only be accessed by four-wheel drive. The three-day search was carried out near Mr Spedding's home.

James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video . After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun . The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport . The £6 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.'

"Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that intercepted phone calls prove the US helped Chechen Islamic insurgents wage war against Russia . Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that intercepted phone calls prove the US helped Chechen Islamic insurgents wage war against Russia. In a documentary aired today  on state-owned Rossiya-1 TV channel, he said phone records from the early 2000s show direct contact between North Caucasus separatists and US secret services. 'At one point our secret services simply detected direct contacts between militants from the North Caucasus and representatives of the United States secret services in Azerbaijan,' Putin said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question. But he claimed a few days later the heads of Russia's FSB received a letter from their American counterparts, which said they had the right to support opposition forces in Russia. 'Someone over there, especially the West's intelligence services, obviously thought that if they act to destabilize their main geopolitical rival, which, as we now understand, in their eyes has always been Russia, it would be good for them. It turned out, it wasn't,' Putin said. He said he had warned the West about the possible dangers of supporting terrorists. Following a disastrous war in the 1990s, Russia fought Islamic insurgents in Chechnya and neighboring regions in the volatile North Caucasus. 'They were actually helping them, even with transportation,' Putin said. The documentary 'The President' showed Putin being interviewed at the Kremlin in the dimly-lit St. Alexander's Hall. He even defended the annexation of Crimea as a response to the will of the people, saying it righted a historical injustice. The annexation of the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 provoked the worst crisis between the West and Russia since the end of the Cold War. Putin said he had no regrets. 'It's not because Crimea has a strategic importance in the Black Sea region. It's because this has elements of historical justice. I believe we did the right thing and I don't regret anything,' he said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question . Putin also said sanctions imposed by the West after the annexation were aimed at halting Russia's progress as a global power. Putin condemned punitive sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union. 'We have witnessed such attempts during Russia's entire history, dating back to tsarist times. This attempt to deter Russia, this policy, has been known for a long time, for centuries. There is nothing new,' he was reported as saying. Putin also expressed his fears that the West wishes Russia harm as he recalled how some world leaders told him they would not mind Russia's possible disintegration. 'My counterparts, a lot of presidents and prime ministers told me later on that they had decided for themselves by then that Russia would cease to exist in its current form,' he said. 'The only question was when it happens and what consequences would be.'","Putin said calls show contact between insurgents and US secret services .

"A Californian man who was abandoned as a baby had a chance to meet the man who saved him from a dumpster 25 years ago. When Robin Barton, 25, was just four hours old, now-retired Santa Ana police officer Michael Buelna found him abandoned behind a garbage dumpster on November 21, 1989. He had heard the sound of a 'very low meow' and at first thought it was a cat behind the dumpster, but after moving some trash he discovered Barton's infant body. Scroll down for video . Robin Barton was rescued by Michael Buelna after he was abandoned as an infant (left). The two met for the first time since the incident, which occurred 25 years ago, last week and embraced (right) Barton (left) is now 25 years old and said it was 'wonderful' to finally meet Buelna (right), who saved his life when Barton was just four hours old and his mother abandoned him behind a dumpster . 'I noticed the umbilical cord and he was covered, he still had all the mucus and stuff and all the trash and gravel was sticking to him,' Buelna told ABC. 'I tried to give him a tiny little bit of breath and he reacted a little bit.' Though Buelna initially wanted to adopt the boy, who weight just 4lb 2oz, and name him Adam, Barton's adoptive parents, Elizabeth Barton and Daniel Fernandez of Orange County, beat him to it. Barton and his adoptive parents had the chance to meet with Buelna last week. It was the first time Buelna has seen Barton since he was abandoned. 'Nice. Wonderful to finally have met you, to see the man who found me first,' Barton said to Buelna, according to CBS Los Angeles. Barton was adopted by Elizabeth Barton and Daniel Fernandez of Orange County and he said he was 'blessed with a great family' Buelna said he shares a special bond with Barton because he was left by his mother, too. As a child his mother abandoned him and his four siblings . The pair embraced when they first met and Barton's parents were glad to finally meet the man who allowed them to have Barton as a child. 'I had the opportunity to shake his hand and look in his eyes and say, ""Thank you for saving his life"",' Fernandez said. Barton and Buelna share a special bond, as the retired officer was abandoned by his mother as a young child, too, along with his four siblings. 'I spent over 20 years looking for my mother,' Buelna told CBS, and he hopes to aid Barton in his search. Buelna initially wanted to adopt Barton, pictured here as an infant, but was beaten to it by Fernandez and Barton. He now hopes to help find the man's biological mother . Barton said he's been 'blessed with a great family', and he forgives his mother for what she did because she 'was a young woman in a very compromising position'. His 19-year-old mother, later identified at Sabrina Diaz, was arrested for child endangerment and attempted murder and spend three years in prison. Barton said he'd like to find her because it would help him get closure on the subject. As for Buelna, he's simply happy he got to see the baby boy he saved grow up. 'I hoped that some day I would see him again,' Buelna said. Barton was abandoned behind these dumpsters in November 1989.

"Katia Apalategui was inspired after seeing her mother cope with the loss of her husband by clinging to his pillow. Pictured posed by model . A grieving daughter has come up with an unusual way to keep the memory of loved ones alive - by bottling their scent. Seven years ago, Katia Apalategui's mother coped with losing her husband by holding on to his pillowcase which his smell clung to. This inspired the 52-year-old French insurance saleswoman to think of a more permanent way to capture a person's individual scent in a bid to help others in mourning. The strong link between smell and memory is the reason her product will provide 'olfactory comfort' to customers, she says. 'We are going through funeral homes to offer families a small box containing a vial of the departed's odour that we would have extracted from a piece of material provided by them,' she said. But the 'made-to-measure' perfumes will be rather costly and be priced at around 560 euros (£400). To help develop her idea, she teamed up with the Havre university in France, where researchers have developed a technique to reproduce the human smell. The university's Geraldine Savary explained the process involved taking a person's clothes and extracting the odour - a few hundred characteristic molecules - which is then made into a bottle of perfume in four days. She said: 'There was a perfect synergy between what she wanted to do and what our researchers are doing so we decided to get involved. 'There is a very strong link between memory and smell which is similar to that between the memories we have from looking at old photos, videos and other things. 'We take the person's clothing and extract the odour, which represents about a hundred molecules, and we reconstruct it in the form of a perfume in four days.' She came up with a more permanent way to capture a person's individual scent in a bid to help others in mourning. File photo . Popular Science reports the classic process of perfume distillation is the most likely method, which involves passing steam through an object at high temperatures and capturing the result. And Ms Apalategui, although first inspired by death, is hoping her product could be also be ideal Valentine's Day gifts or even for children away from their parents. Her son, who is in business school, is planning to launch by September this year.","Seven years ago, insurance saleswoman Katia Apalategui lost her father .

'It’s an honor to be here at the Washington Hilton . . . is something a prostitute might say to a congressman.' 'I bet when the president walked in tonight and saw the bell hops, he probably thought, ‘Finally, some decent security.’ She pivoted from her joke about recent Secret Service lapses to speaking about a series of episodes of alleged police brutality toward African-Americans. Strong said that the president security force is 'the only law enforcement organization in the country that will get in trouble if a black man gets shot.' She also said that Obama's graying hair 'is so white now it can talk back to the police'. Saying that she 'would never endorse someone I don't play on SNL', Strong spent much of her speech riffing on the Clinton family. The comedian made media outlets assembled promise not to report on Hillary Clinton's appearance because it was 'not journalism', and poked fun at foreign donation to the Clinton Foundation . Strong said that Michelle Obama (left) was the 'most important person in the room', but that her garden would be turned into an above ground pool by Bill Clinton . 'Let’s talk about the most important person in the room, my leader: Michelle Obama. Now Michelle, you take care of that garden while you can. In 18 months, you know Bill is turning that thing into an above-ground pool'. After making media outlets promise not to report about Hillary's appearance, Strong also said that US's tense relationship with Israel could be fixed if the Middle Eastern country 'made a generous donation to the Clinton Foundation'. Republicans eyeing for the presidency in 2016 also came under fire during the annual event, with Senator Ted Cruz being called the exact opposite of Obama, 'a Canadian Latino who will never be president'. 'Jeb Bush is probably in the race. The presidential race, not the Hispanic race,' she said, referencing his checking 'Hispanic' on a voter registration form in 2009. However, the comedian went after other figures beyond politicians, taking shots at the media executives seated in the audience. 'BuzzFeed is here, but I could show you a listicle of 17 reasons why they shouldn’t be,' she said. 'USA Today is here, of course, they’re only here because they were slipped under the hotel door. That’s USA Today, unless today is Saturday or Sunday'. She touched on the media's biggest scandal over the past year with a quick quip at her own network. 'And what can I say about Brian Williams?” Strong asked. 'Nothing, because I work for NBC,' she said.","SNL castmember skewers Hillary Clinton, Obama and Republican hopefuls .

"Millions of years of erosion, explosions and a touch of folklore form the narrative behind some of the most unbelievable sights in the world. From sweeping curves of Arizona's The Wave in the U.S. to the Fairy Chimneys of Turkey's Cappadocia, the simple flow of water over stone has created some remarkable features that look as though they aren't even of this planet, all of which we can visit and marvel at today. Many of them are incredible natural deceptions, such as Yellowstone National Park's Grand Prismatic Spring, which looks for all money in some photographs like a volcano but is in fact the first largest hot spring in the world. Here are some of the most unbelievable landscapes in the world. Scroll down for video . The Wave, Arizona . The sweeping design of this sandstone rock formation is found in the Coyote Buttes area of the Arizona Strip in Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness area that would be hugely popular with hikers were it not so heavily protected. Experts say the best photo opportunities come at midday but first visitors must get one of the 20 permits released each day for the area, with 10 of them released via a lottery four months in advance and the other ten dished out the day before an intended visit. Experts say the best photo opportunities for The Wave come at midday but first visitors must get one of the 20 permits released each day . Once permission is granted to visit there are no marked hiking tracks to get you there, as authorities are keen to preserve its natural beauty formed by the erosion of Navajo Sandstone during Jurassic age. The 190 million-year-old formation is made of sand dunes which turned to rock through time. They are stacked on top of another and hardened by deposit of calcium salts - causing the vertical and horizontal layers. The rocks are 190 million years old, and visitors are reminded to respect the beautiful environment . Svinafellsjokull glacier, Iceland . Svinafellsjokull glacier, part of the great Vatnajökull Glacier in Skaftafell National Park, may look totally inhospitable but with the right gear and guide it's a popular hiking destination. Icelandic Mountain Guides are among a host of companies running tours and charge from £65 for a four-hour walk. The glacier has also achieved an extra level of fame recently after being one of the filming locations for the blockbuster film Interstellar, starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway, where is wasn't a huge stretch for the icy landscape to co-star as space. Svinafellsjokull glacier, part of the great Vatnajökull Glacier in Skaftafell National Park, is a popular hiking destination in Iceland . 'Interstellar was my second time filming in Iceland and it was another worldly experience,' the director told Film In Iceland. 'Iceland truly represents the beautiful extremes the nature has to offer.' Tourists who wish to take on an expediation will be given an expert guide, who will teach how to use basic glacier equipment like crampons and ice axes, the required equipment for this tour. The Svinafellsjokull glacier in Iceland may indeed be imposing, but guides are on hand to guide visitors through how to navigate the trek . Fairy Chimneys, Turkey . Legend has it that fairies living in ancient Cappadocia in Turkey's Central Anatolia lived underground, and these bizarre rock formations were the chimneys of their hidden residences. Another theory is the distinctive feature of the World Heritage Listed area were formed first by layers from rock developed over time courtesy of volcanic eruptions, and then erosion. The granite at the top that forms the mushroom cap-type feature is harder than the colourful sandstone below, hence the brilliant design. Visitors to Cappadocia can see the fairy chimneys in a host of ways. You can hire quad bike tours that can quickly get you around the vast area that includes the Sword Valley, Love Valley and Rose Valley - each with their own features and colours. But you can only go around the outside on the bikes. For a close-up experience try a horseback tour. There are a host of ranches offering horses and guides, and it makes sense when you consider Cappadocia actually means, Land of the Beautiful Horses. Legend has it that fairies lived underground in ancient Cappadocia in Turkey's Central Anatolia and these formations were their chimneys . Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia . The world's largest salt flats are a sight to behold, with it covering a whopping 4.085 square miles in the Department of Potosi in southwest Bolivia. While salt is associated with the ocean, these flats are found 11,995 feet above sea level after being formed by a number of prehistoric lakes. The white covering is literally metres of salt crust and it is incredibly flat with less than a metre difference across the entire area.

The Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia produces salt that inexplicably leads to a bustling trade for excavations . Grand Prismatic Spring, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming . It looks like a bubbling volcano ready to blow but is in fact the third largest hot spring in the world, behind only after Frying Pan Lake in New Zealand and Boiling Lake in Dominica. Found in the Midway Geyser Basin at Yellowstone, it is also the biggest hot spring in the United States, but it's not size that makes it so remarkable. It looks like a bubbling volcano ready to blow but Grand Prismatic Spring is in fact the third largest hot spring in the world . The bright coloration of the spring is it's real point of marvel, with its shades of red, orange, yellow, green and blue. The unique park has a 40-mile-long slush of molten rock and crystal under the nation's first national park. Instead of a cone with a hole, the caldera is an interconnected maze of gas and water covering almost 60 miles of Wyoming's northwest corner, along with parts of Montana and Idaho. More than 10,000 mud pots, boiling rivers and geysers act as nature's pressure-release valves, keeping the heated monster from exploding. The bright coloration of the spring is it's real point of marvel, with its shades of red, orange, yellow, green and blue . Dallol, Ethiopia . As if a giant hypercolour pen exploded on the moon, the Dallol hydrothermal fields offer some incredible flourescent colours - all from nature. Found in the northeast of the Erta Ale Range in the rather grim-looking Danakil Depression in Ethiopia, the craters are the lowest subaerial volcanic vents in the world. As if a giant hypercolour pen exploded on the moon, the Dallo hydrothermal fields in the Erta Ale Range offer some incredible colours . The bright yellow of the sulphur mixes with the white salt for this bizarre effect. For centuries Ethiopians have made the long trek to the Danakil Depression - one of the hottest and harshest environments in the world - to collect salt from the sun-blasted earth before transporting the slabs back by camel. The sulphur mixing with salt produces some fantastic reactions across this Ethiopian landscape . Life is harsh for the thousands of camel herders and salt extractors who use traditional hoes and axes to carve the 'white gold' out of the ground in the Danakil Depression. Many of the salt diggers live in Hamad-Ile and hire out their services to different caravans. The work, however exhausting, still draws thousands onto the baking salt flats. Zhangye Danxia Landform, China . What looks like something created with coloured sand in primary school is in fact a colourful sandstone formation in the hills near Zhangye City. Walkways have been established throughout the area by the government to accommodate walkers keen to admire what is said to be 24 million years worth of red sandstone and mineral deposits. Geologists say the same tectonic plates that formed the Himalayas created the layer cake effect and centuries of water erosion complete the design.

"Don't play H-O-R-S-E with this guy... LeBron James has been able to do just about anything he wants during his team's first three playoff games this season and that has apparently carried over to practice as well. James was at practice with his Cleveland Cavalier teammates on Saturday at the TD Garden in Boston before their game against the Celtics on Sunday afternoon. During a break in the action, James decided to practice his long-range shooting. Scroll down for video . LeBron James hit a one-handed shot, which traveled almost the full length of the 94-foot court, on Saturday . After he wound up for the shot (left), James flicked it overhand (right) while his teammates watched him shoot . Just before the long distance shot went through the hoop, James could be heard saying: 'Give me my money' The NBA superstar grabbed a basketball and flicked it with relative ease at the hoop at the other end of the court. The one-handed shot, which traveled almost the entire length of the 94-foot court, dropped through the basket with an audible swish. Just before the full-court shot hit nothing but net, 'King James' said: 'Give me my money'. It's unclear who, if anyone James bet with, but James Jones did seem as if he was trying to disrupt the former MVP's concentration before the shot. Jones was also teammates with James when they both played for the Miami Heat. In 13 career postseason games in Boston, James is averaging about 29 points, nine rebounds, and six assists . After the video began to spread via social media, Dwight Howard of the Houston Rockets issued a response. In a clip the team posted, the center is seen swishing a one-handed shot of his own while wearing a yellow backpack. Instead of tossing the ball overhand, Howard used a motion that was one part underhand and one part sidearm to make his full-court shot find paydirt. Apparently Superman - Howard's nickname - is just as powerful as the King. After the video began to spread via social media, Dwight Howard of the Houston Rockets issued a response . The Cavs hold a 3-0 lead in their Eastern Conference first-round playoff series against the Celtics.

"The Tories are inching ahead of Labour as Nigel Farage starts to peel off Ed Miliband’s supporters. And English voters are so alarmed by the prospect of being ruled by Nicola Sturgeon with Miliband in her pocket that they would prefer to get rid of her – and Scotland – by giving the country independence after all. These are among the remarkable findings of a Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday which illustrates growing fears about the result of the most closely fought Election for decades. A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday has shown a swing towards the Tories against Miliband's Labour party . Fear of Nicola Sturgeon, pictured, among Labour voters in England is pushing them towards Nigel Farage . David Cameron, pictured, has surged ahead by three points in the polls going into the final stage of the election . The poll suggests David Cameron is pulling ahead of Labour. The Conservatives are on 33 points, followed by Labour on 30, Ukip 18 and the Lib Dems 9 – the third Survation poll in a row to show a lead for the Tories. Intriguingly, there are signs that Labour, and not the Tories, is at risk from Farage’s Ukip. In the past three weeks, Ukip support has risen by five points, with a corresponding four-point fall in backing for Labour. Furthermore, the Tories could benefit from Ukip voters returning to them as a result of the ‘Red Ed and Nicola the Nat’ factor. Asked if they would consider voting Conservative to stop a Miliband-Sturgeon alliance running the country, nearly two in five Ukip supporters said yes, against one in two who said no. The new trends coincide with the huge impact of Scottish Nationalist leader Sturgeon on the campaign since the TV debates, in which she repeatedly squared up to Miliband. The poll offers Cameron hope that more Ukip supporters may be provoked into returning to the Tories as a result of the Sturgeon threat. The dip in Miliband’s popularity appears to reflect the belief that if he relied on Sturgeon to get his legislation approved by Parliament, she would hold the whip hand – even though her party would have only a fraction of the number of Labour MPs. More than half of those polled think Sturgeon would have the upper hand over Miliband, with fewer than three in ten saying the Labour leader would call the shots. The latest poll expressed concern over the possible influence Nicola Sturgeon would have over Ed Miliband . The poll also highlights the growing resentment among English voters at the thought of Scottish Nationalist MPs shaping laws in England on issues such as schools and hospitals, even though English MPs have no such power over these matters in Scotland. A third said that if the Election produced a Miliband-Sturgeon pact to run Britain, they would regard the result as ‘illegitimate’. That bears out the stark warning made by Home Secretary Theresa May today of the danger of a backlash by English voters if the SNP is involved in the Government of the UK. A total of 37 per cent of those polled said they would regard such a result as legitimate. According to the poll, English people may decide they would rather Scotland was given independence than be ruled by Left-wing Scottish Nationalists in harness with Labour. In the event of Miliband and Sturgeon forming some kind of ruling pact, more than 40 per cent said they would prefer Scotland to be independent. A third disagreed. In effect, it could lead to England and Wales declaring independence from Scotland in a reversal of last year’s referendum, when the Scots voted to stay in the UK. The poll leaves no room for doubt where voters think Sturgeon’s heart lies. Nearly three in four say she cares more about Scottish independence than whether the UK economy is doing will. Fewer than one in eight disagree. The survey also contains more evidence of Cameron’s personal ratings lead over Miliband. By a margin of nearly two to one, the public believes Miliband’s claim that the Prime Minister was to blame for the deaths of nearly 1,000 migrants from Libya in the Mediterranean showed that the Labour leader was ‘unfit to be PM’. The survey also indicates the Conservatives are winning the key economic arguments. Voters believe that if the Tories win the General Election on May 7, the economy is more likely to grow over the next five years; taxes and unemployment will be lower; the country will be safer; welfare abuse will be curbed and people will be generally better off. Labour won on two counts: better schools and hospitals and fewer food banks.","English voters have grave concerns over Nicola Sturgeon's power plan .

The hippo attempted to scare off the three-year-old lions as they tried to attack the mammal at the nature reserve in the west of Zimbabwe . The large hippo waits until the lions appear to back down before attempting to turn around and retreat towards some nearby water . The hippopotamus makes its way into some muddy water while the lions look on, but the dramatic altercation is far from over yet . The dramatic altercation was caught on camera by researcher Brent Stapelkamp, who has been studying the activities and behaviour of lions in the Zimbabwean reserve for years. The 37-year-old said: 'The two male lions in the photos are just three-years-old and left their pride a few days before these shots were taken. 'As far as we can tell they have not eaten anything since they left and this incident was probably their first try at self-catering. 'The lions attempted to catch the large calf, but the hippo quickly ran to the safety of the water. 'As the lions walked away the cocky hippo showed them who is boss and charged right back at the two cats causing them to scatter.' As the lions continue to taunt the hippo, the large mammal turns around and charges out of the water towards the two young lions . The stand-off was caught on camera by researcher Brent Stapelkamp, who has been studying the behaviour of lions in the area for years . The three-year-old lions, who may be trying to land their first catch, finally back away from the hippo as it continues to charge at them . The hippo retreats to others of its kind as the lions finally leave the pack alone and instead simply look on from afar. Mr Stapelkamp said the lions will become more adept at hunting prey as they mature, adding: 'They will learn that they are probably better off eating warthogs' Mr Stapelkamp explained that as the pair of lions mature they will become more adept at hunting prey. He said: 'As brothers these two will no doubt stick together in their dispersal and form a coalition which has a better chance of securing territory. 'They will soon learn that rather than catching large prey like this hippo calf, they are probably better off eating warthogs and young giraffe first. 'The hippo was actually not scared at all, no doubt secure in the knowledge that mum was just meters away ready to help out.'","Dramatic pictures show two three-year-old lions antagonising hippopotamus in Zimbabwean National Park .

"A bride-to-be who thought she had beaten a rare cancer has been forced to bring forward her wedding date after the devastating news that the illness has returned. The friends and family of Courtney Terry, 27, are now furiously fundraising in a bid to fulfill her final wish of a dream wedding. Courtney was just 19 when she was first diagnosed with the same disease that killed her 23-year-old brother Jordan seven years ago. Courtney Terry, 27, with her childhood sweetheart Billy Webb and daughter Dolcie . But despite chemotherapy and a kidney removal, her kidney cancer - which is so rare it does not have a name - returned when she became pregnant in 2009. Courtney, from Barnehurst, south-east London, had planned to marry her childhood sweetheart Billy Webb in seven months' time. But doctors have advised her to bring the event forward because of her worsening condition. Now she and her family are relying are on the kindness of strangers to crowdfund their wedding. Courtney and Billy had been planning to marry in seven months time but have had to bring forward the wedding because her condition has worsened . The family hope to raise £20,000 so the event in a few weeks can create happy memories for Billy and her five-year-old daughter, Dolcie. The keen Millwall FC fan has received multiple treatments including chemotherapy, trials, surgery and radiotherapy. But she has no more treatment options left. Courtney, who has been engaged to Billy for two years, said: 'It is too late to help me now. 'There is no more surgery or chemo. I know I am going to die. 'I won't grow old with the man I love or see my girl grow up. 'But the one thing I can do before it is too late is be Mrs Webb.' Courtney, pictured here with Billy and Dolcie, has a kidney cancer so rare that it has no name . She continued: 'I waited and waited to get married as I wanted to get well first, and there was always another operation or drug trial that got in the way. 'Now I just want to do it before it is too late.' Courtney, whose cancer is so rare doctors do not have a name for it, added : 'I look at my future and I see where it ends. I will die never knowing what is wrong with me - never having a name for it. 'But this wedding is my chance to make memories for my family that will last a lifetime, even if I don't. 'I just pray we can get the money together in time.' The amount raised so far has topped £14,000 with 65 days left to raise their target figure. Courtney, pictured with her boyfriend and daughter, is now hoping to get married in less than three months time . Her family said in a statement: 'Courtney has been unbelievably strong, coping with treatments and their side effects and was often given bad news, whilst being a mum and raising a beautiful little girl. 'They had planned to get married in November, but this week she was advised by her medical team that they should bring forward the wedding as she may not be well enough in November, as her disease is terminal. 'This had a huge impact on the family, who did not expect to hear that her death was going to be so soon. 'They had a dream for a fairytale wedding to provide an extra special positive memory for Dolcie, Billy and their families.'

"Police in Delaware charged a woman with fatally stabbing her husband in their home after an argument about him cheating on her with own her sister and their nanny's daughter. New Castle County police charged Temitope Adebamiro with first-degree murder on Friday after being called to her home in Bear early on Thursday morning because of an 'unknown problem'. When they arrived at the home around 12:40am, they found 37-year-old Adeyinka Adebamiro unconscious in a bedroom with a stab wound to his upper body and his wife in bloody clothes. Scroll down for video . Temitope Adebamiro, 35, was charged with murder on Friday after her husband's death was ruled a homicde . Police were called to a home in Bear, Delaware, early on Thursday and found Adeyinka Adebamiro stabbed . Paramedics pronounced him dead about an hour later and the Delaware Division of Forensic Science ruled Adeyinka’s death a homicide, according to the News Journal. The husband, Adebamiro, their two children and a nanny had been living at the home for two years. Adebamiro, 35, and the victim had been married for more than ten years, although she told police he had physically abused her while she was pregnant, cheated on her with several women and sent her to Nigeria on multiple occasions. She said he last sent her to Nigeria over Christmas so he could spend it with the nanny's daughter. Detectives determined there was a verbal argument that led to a physical altercation. The argument allegedly began after the victim found photos on Adebamiro's cellphone that she had taken of pictures he had stored on his mobile phone. The stored pictures were of Adebamiro's sister and the nanny's daughter. At some point after the argument, a single stab wound severed the victim's carotid artery and jugular vein. Adebamiro's story about what happened changed several times and she suggested that her husband killed himself as well as mentioned a power outage that never happened. She did not ever admit to the killing, but investigators felt there was enough evidence to charge her. In addition to murder, Adebamiro was charged with possession of a weapon during the commission of a felony. She was arraigned and committed to the Delores J Baylor Women’s Correctional Institution where she is being held without bail.","Temitope Adebamiro arrested Friday and charged with first-degree murder .

"This is the moment Jeremy Clarkson talked himself out of a ticket after leaving his bright green Lamborghini parked on yellow lines. Despite his recent woes, he was seen laughing with a traffic warden in London, who had tried to put a ticket on his borrowed supercar. The warden recognized the former Top Gear host immediately and the pair chatted for a few minutes. And the conversation must have been a good one - as the warden then appeared to walk away without leaving a ticket on the eye-catching Lamborghini. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson talked himself out of a parking ticket in London today after leaving his green Lamborghini parked on yellow lines . After spending 15 minutes inspecting a black Ferrari, Clarkson drove off in his eye-catching supercar . Clarkson was also spotted at Stamford Bridge, cheering on Chelsea as they drew 0-0 with Arsenal . Clarkson had met up with two people who were showing him black Ferrari Pininfarina 275. He was inspecting the car as if he may have had an interest in buying it. After spending around 15 minutes looking at the car, he drove off in his Lamborghini, which has Italian number plates. Clarkson, 55, was sensationally sacked from Top Gear by the BBC last month after a 'fracas' involving a producer during filming. This week Richard Hammond, 45, joined James May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear following Clarkson's sacking, insisting on Friday he had no plan to 'quit my mates.' Today, Hammond told reporters at a charity bike rally that the future will be 'exciting' but refused to speculate further on the future of Top Gear. The former Top Gear presenter stopped for a chat with tennis coach Boris Becker after the full-time whistle . Clarkson did not seem to entertained by the match between the two London sides, which was a bore draw . Jeremy Clarkson (left) is seen with his Top Gear colleagues James May (centre) and Richard Hammond (right) outside his west London flat this week, in their first public appearance since he was sacked . He said: 'Everybody knows what's happened. That's all been in the news. The future, nobody knows yet do they? 'And I cannot and won't speculate further than that. So don't know, let's see. It'll be exciting whatever.' Hammond's resignation marked another blow for the popular show, which has been marred by uncertainty since Clarkson was axed. There is mounting speculation the men are working on a new motoring series to be aired by Netflix, Amazon or another British broadcaster. Producer Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. The incident led to the BBC deciding not to renew Clarkson's contract after the current Top Gear series of Top Gear finishes. Police investigated the attack but Tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would 'not be pursuing the matter any further.' And Clarkson recently admitted had suffered a cancer scare around the time of the incident.","Axed Top Gear presenter was seen laughing with traffic warden in London .

"Teenage Aldi worker Christian Trousedale became an internet hit after a picture of him carrying a 95-year-old pensioner's shopping home went viral . A teenage Aldi worker says he is 'blown away' by the public reaction after a picture of him carrying a 95-year-old pensioner's shopping home went viral. Christian Trousedale, 18, walked the elderly man to his front door, holding his hand as they made their way to his home in Horwich, near Bolton. His act of kindness was seen by Samantha-Jayne Brady, who stopped them to take a picture which she then posted on Facebook. The picture of Mr Trousedale and the pensioner has been 'liked' a quarter of a million times and shared by 70,000 people. It's attracted attention from all over the world, with more than 50,000 shares in Dubai, Australia, the United States and elsewhere. Christian said he was 'blown away' by the reaction to an act of kindness that was 'just something I would normally do'. He added: 'The reaction has been completely crazy, my facebook is just overflowing with messages, I can't even start to read them all. 'One woman posted on my wall from America saying that she wished there were more people in her country like me, it has been really amazing. 'I went back into Aldi this afternoon and a lady came up and hugged me and said she loved what I had done.' Christian had spotted the 96-year-old about to make the journey alone and on foot in strong winds so asked his superiors if he could offer some help. Mr Trousedale, a college student who works part-time as a stock assistant at the supermarket, told the Bolton News that he did not consider his actions extraordinary, and that he had been brought up to respect his elders. He said: 'I asked my manager if it was OK to walk him home and he said that was the right thing to do, so I did. 'We had a good chat about everything from the General Election to the history of Horwich - he knew lots about everything.' 'It is very strange because this is just something I would normally do, my parents have raised me to treat other people like you want to be treated yourself,' he said. The picture of Mr Trousedale and the pensioner has been 'liked' a quarter of a million times and shared by 70,000 people . Onlooker Miss Brady, who works in a fish and chip shop near the supermarket, said she posted the picture because she was taken aback by Christian's 'selfless, thoughtful and caring gesture'. She wrote: 'Need to share this, whilst working earlier we watched this lovely lad walking this little old man home. 'He wasn't very agile, nor fast but Christian walked with him ever so patiently and slowly, chatted along with him and carried his bag for him. 'It was a lovely thing to witness and they seemed to be having a good chit-chat along their way. 'High 5 to Aldi for letting him do this and high 5 to Christian from Aldi in Horwich for his selfless, thoughtful & caring gesture! 'I desperately want this lad to get some kind of recognition from his workplace so if this gave you a little more faith in mankind PLEASE share! Good people still exist.' Both Mr Trousedale, who works at the Aldi (pictured) in Horwich, near Bolton, and Miss Brady's Facebook pages have been flooded with praise . Miss Brady said she wanted to share the image and story because she feels that not enough positive stories about young people are shared around. She added: 'There are so many negative stories about young people but the positive ones just aren't seen on a large scale.' Miss Brady received a bottle of wine and a bunch of flowers from Aldi as a thank you for spreading the 18-year-old's good deed. Both Mr Trousedale and Miss Brady's Facebook pages have been flooded with praise since the photograph was taken on Friday. Among the messages of support posted online was this one from Jackie Bleszinski, who wrote: 'How lovely, glad to see there are still good people around and refreshing to hear about it instead of usual doom and gloom.' Daphne Stephens posted: 'Oh so well done - bet your parents and relations are super proud of you, I know I would be.' Mr Trouesdale's mother, Lynda, responded to the many positive comments about her son by stating: 'Thank you everyone for your kind and beautiful words, they have touched me and my husband very much. 'It's been rewarding and emotional reading people's lovely comments. We as a family are very close and me and my husband are extremely proud of our sons and how they have turned out to be.'","Christian Trousedale was seen helping elderly man home from shops .

They filled two city blocks and marched 2 miles to City Hall, where the crowd overtook the grassy plaza adjacent from the building. Tanya Peacher, a 36-year-old Baltimore resident, said she'd never attended a protest in the city before, but watching a video of Gray's arrest motivated her. 'I looked at my son,' she said, 'and thought ''that is my son.'' Late on Friday, Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis said Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested - before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the department's policy..

On Saturday, residents young and old, from Baltimore and beyond, gathered around noon and voiced their anger at how the department and the city's officials are handling the investigation into Gray's death. At one point, the crowd paused for a moment of silence in front of Shock Trauma, the hospital where Gray died. The marchers then migrated to Camden Yards. At a downtown intersection, a dozen marchers laid down in the street during an impromptu 'die-in.' The police department has conceded Gray should have received medical attention when he asked for it . People lay in the streets on Saturday afternoon mimicking the way Gray was held as he cried for help during his arrest . Wearing a sign around his neck that said 'I am Freddie Gray,' 33-year-old Dante Acree joined thousands of others outside City Hall. Acree said he came out to the protest because 'it could have been one of my kids.' 'It could have been my brother, my father,' he said. 'I'd want the same support.' Leonard Patterson, 56, said he drove from Manassas, Virginia, to be a part of the protest. Patterson said he decided to come after thinking about his college-aged daughter. 'I'm trying to do everything in my limbs, everything in my power, to make this a better world for her,' said Patterson, holding up his black and white drawing of Freddie Gray. The drawing shows Gray being hoisted from a police van to heaven by two angels. 'I'm here to do what I can. Police brutality is as old as the 1950s, the 1960s. It's still here,' he said.

"Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson has been filmed lashing out at an aggressive AFL fan after his team's narrow loss to Port Adelaide on Saturday night. The footage shows a young man, thought to be an Adelaide Power fan, taunting Clarkson as he made his way back to his Adelaide hotel room, before Clarkson pushes the man and grabs his neck. It appears the video was captured by a friend of the young man and it's understood the pair had been goading Clarkson in the lead-up to the confrontation. Scroll down for video . Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson was filmed lashing out at a young man, thought to be an Adelaide Power fan after his team's loss on the weekend . Alastair Clarkson was approached by the fan as he made his way back to his Adelaide hotel room. The man reportedly 'got in his face' yelling 'Hey Clarko, how was the win today brother?' In the video, which was provided to Channel Seven, the fan is seen shouting in the face of the Hawks coach. 'Hey Clarko, Clarko, how was the win, how was the win today brother? Goooo the Power! An agitated Clarkson lashes out at the man before grabbing him by the throat. The incident took place in the hours after the Hawthorn Hawks' narrow eight-point loss to Port Adelaide. Hawthorn CEO Stuart Fox, who saw the incident unfold, has described it as 'very unfortunate.' 'Alastair was walking back to the hotel with our general manager of football Chris Fagan and came across some intoxicated boys and Clarko was certainly harassed,' Fox said in an interview with Fox Sports. 'He politely declined to be photographed and videoed and the boys just got in his face and tried to get Clarko into the hotel and it was one of those issues that got a little bit ugly. It's not known whether the man in the video was a Power supporter as he wasn't wearing any Port Adelaide clothing. Port Adelaide CEO Keith Thomas said those responsible would be held accountable if found to be club members. 'If it is a Port Adelaide member … we'll be acting pretty aggressively about that,' Thomas told Fox Sports. Hawks coach Alastair Clarkson, pictured, was 'pushed and shoved all the way to the door,' says Hawthorn CEO . It's not the first altercation the Hawthorn coach has been involved in. In 2006 Clarkson was fined $5000 for abusing umpires on board a plane and in 2008 he was fined for criticising umpire Justin Schmitt’s performance which involved a defeat to Geelong. But Hawthorn's Stuart Fox and others in the AFL community have voiced their support of Clarkson, saying he was 'harassed.' Fox said the video missed the minute prior to the incident where Clarkson and Chris Fagan declined photographs with the two fans and tried to get themselves to the hotel room. 'They were pushed and shoved all the way up to the door and, unfortunately, Clarko's pushed back and got himself in the hotel and gone straight to bed' Fox said. Fox said the incident draws attention to the lack of security at the hotel. He said the club has contacted the AFL to seek clarification on post-game security procedures. In 2006, Clarkson was fined $5000 for abusing umpires on a flight and in 2008 he was fined for criticising umpire's performance over a defeat to Geelong .

"Jamie Robbins (above) handed himself into the police a year after he stole £1,600 from a convenience store in Birmingham with an accomplice because he preferred life in jail . A robber handed himself into police a year after he raided a convenience store saying he preferred life in jail. Jamie Robbins stole £1,600 from the Select 'n' Save shop in Kings Norton, Birmingham, with an accomplice on January 13, 2014. The case was not solved until the 35-year-old walked into a police station earlier this year and said: 'Please arrest me.' Robbins was jailed for four-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to robbery and possession of a bladed article at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday. Ayoub Khan, defending, said Robbins had felt he could not cope outside of prison and wanted to go back behind bars. But Mr Khan added that the day before his court appearance Robbins discovered his girlfriend was pregnant - and no longer wanted to be given a custodial sentence. 'There has been an enormous change in direction of his life. He now has purpose in his life,' he said. Judge Murray Creed, sentencing, described the events as 'unusual' as the inquiry had stopped. He said: 'But for your surrender it does not look as though matters would have recommenced. This was a group attack, planned, and there was a weapon and disguises.' Robbins, of no fixed address, gave detectives full details of the robbery. He explained how he and another masked man had waited outside the store until a woman and her small child had finished their shopping. Robbins then burst into the shop with a machete and his accomplice, and demanded the shopkeeper hand over the safe. Judge Murray Creed, sentencing, described the events as 'unusual' at the hearing at Birmingham Crown Court (above) He threatened the owner with the knife and the pair escaped with £1,600, which they split between them. Robbins even told police the getaway driver did not get his cut because he had not waited in the car as had been agreed. Christopher Lester, prosecuting, said: 'The day before the incident, Robbins was called and asked if he wanted to be in a robbery. 'The next day he met two other men and the defendant took the weapon.' Mr Lee added that the original police investigation had not been successful and Robbins was only convicted because of the evidence he gave in interview.","Jamie Robbins raided a Select 'n' Save shop in Birmingham last January .

"One of the three East London schoolgirls who left the UK to become 'jihadi brides' in Syria has confirmed that she is now living in the Islamic State - by tweeting a picture of chicken and chips. Amira Abase, 15, left Bethnal Green with Shamima Begum 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, in February, and is believed to  be living in the Syrian city of Raqqa. Now, nearly two months after her departure, Amira has shared a snippet of life in the Islamic State - posting an online photo of her enjoying a takeaway dinner with another teenage 'jihadi bride'. Scroll down for video . ISIS spread: London schoolgirl Amira Abase, 15, has tweeted from inside the Islamic State for the first time (above), bragging about a Western-style takeaway dinner of fried chicken, chips, pizza and kebab meat . Until recently, the Twitter account of 15-year-old Amira was set to private. The recent public tweet from the radicalised teenager gives a unique insight into the life of the British runaways. It shows a huge Western-style takeaway, including fried chicken, chips, pizza and kebab meat. Amira - tweeting under the name Bintt Abbas - captioned the photograph 'dawla takeaway w/ @um_ayoub12'. 'Dawla' is another name for the Islamic State, which is also known as Isis. 'Um-ayoub12' is the name of another Twitter user, who describes herself as a '16-year-old muhajirah'. She believed to be another of the dozens of western teenagers who have travelled from Europe to join Isis. Amira's dinner companion uses the same profile picture as the 15-year-old from Bethnal Green. Earlier this year the older girl tweeted: 'uh wanna behead some kafirs [non-Muslims] now'. Amira Abase, pictured last September, has tweeted from inside the Islamic State for the first time . Disturbing minds: Amira uses the same Twitter picture as another Western teen runaway, known only as Um Ayoub, who tweeted earlier this year that she wanted to 'behead some kafirs [non-muslims] now'. 'Jihadi brides': This picture is thought to show Amira and her fellow runaways - Bethnal Green Academy students Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, in a London park . Amira's Twitter account shows pictures of Amira's everyday life as a teenager in East London in the months before she left for Syria. They include snaps of her building a tower out of neon highlighter pens during a revision session at Bethnal Green Academy as well as several pictures of the London skyline, which appear to have been taken from her family home. The GCSE pupil also shares her love for Vans and Nike trainers and Chelsea FC. She also appears to be a fan of the Cookies & Cream dessert cafes, tweeting a picture taken in its Whitechapel branch and declaring it has 'the best waffles'. Before her departure to Syria, she tweeted a poignant picture of herself with two friends, believed to be fellow runaways Shamima Begum  and Kadiza Sultana, before their departure. It shows the trio sitting in a London park, and is captioned 'Akhwaat', meaning 'sisters' in Arabic. Earlier this week, it was reported that Abase and her two classmates had joined the fearsome group of British female jihadis who run Isis's ultra-religious police force. Normal teen: As Amira's Twitter account has become public, it also gives an insight into her life as a normal 15-year-old girl in East London, posting about shoes, waffles, sunsets and Chelsea FC . Shoe fan: Several of Amira's tweets from before her departure reference her love for trainers, such as Nike Air Force. In one message she asks her followers whether she should buy a new pair of Vans . Sweet tooth: The 15-year-old posted about her visit to a London branch of Cookies & Cream in December . Runaways:  Amira, left, and her classmates Kadiza Sultana,16 and Shamima Begum, 15 are caught on CCTV at Gatwick airport before they boarded their flight to Turkey two months ago . Londoners Kadiza Sultana (left) and Shamima Begum are thought to be in Raqqa too, along with Amira . Concerns: The three East London schoolgirls are believed to have joined the fearsome group of British female jihadis who run the al-Khansa brigade - Isis's ultra-religious police force . Shamima Begum has forged social media links with three of the British leaders of the al-Khansa brigade – an all-women militia set up by the terror group a year ago. It is understood the trio are now training with one of the notorious female arms of Isis. Covered in black from head to toe and wielding automatic weapons, the group has been accused of doling out savage beatings on the streets of Raqqa, and spying on its citizens. They are said to mercilessly patrol the streets of the terror group's adopted capital, and have previously declared that children as young as nine should be married. They say women should obey men – who are their masters – and remain 'hidden and veiled' at all times. The group operates as an ultra-oppressive police force, monitoring the behaviour of females in the city and dishing out brutal punishments to anyone wearing shoes that aren't black or veils made from the 'wrong' material. According to Syrian activist group 'Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently', the female fanatics are feared by local women due to their use of torture.","Amira Abase, 15, left UK for Syria with two classmates in February .

"Andy Erlam has announced he will stand to be the next Mayor of Tower Hamlets - telling voters it is a chance to 'change everything for the better' The grandfather who won a High Court victory to kick out the crooked mayor‎ of Tower Hamlets yesterday announced he will stand as a 'Martin Bell'-style anti-corruption independent candidate in his place. Andy Erlam pledged to end years of 'Rotten Borough' politics. Last week Mr Erlam led four ordinary voters who defied threats, financial ‎ruin and official apathy to have Lutfur Rahman unseated from office by an electoral court. Rahman - who police afraid of being branded 'racist' failed to charge - was found guilty of rigging his election for mayor in May 2014 by a systematic campaign to steal votes. Yesterday Mr Erlam, 64, a retired film maker, said:‎ 'Since last week, many people have asked me to stand. 'I've given it a lot of thought and have decided ‎to go for it. 'For many years, the people living here have suffered under a corrupt leadership. 'Unless someone stands up to it, there is a danger that Rahman's cronyism and corruption will just continue in another form.' Rahman was banned from office for five years but has many acolytes who are not prevented from standing. In putting his name forward for the election on June 11, Mr Erlam is following in the footsteps of Martin Bell, the former war reporter who stood as an 'anti sleaze' candidate and beat MP Neil Hamilton in Tatton in 1997. ‎Rahman, branded a 'pathological liar' and cheat who 'played the race card on every occasion' by Electoral judge Richard Mawrey QC, diverted millions of pounds from groups like the Alzheimer's Society to Muslim organisations, some with extremist links. Lutfur Rahman, pictured, had the Mayoral office stripped from his after an electoral court found him guilty of rigging his election. He was branded a 'pathological liar' and a cheat happy to 'play the race card' at every turn . Andy Erlam (centre) was one of four petitioners including Angela Moffat (left) and Azmal Hussein (right) who accused Rahman of electoral fraud. Their 'enormous courage' for taking the case forward was praised . Tower Hamlets was so corrupt the government sent in independent commissioners to run it. Mr Erlam said: ‎'The entire local government machine needs to be transformed and with government Commissioners in place, it's the chance in our lifetimes to change everything for the better. 'If elected I will shut down (council-run newsletter) East End Life, the Pravda of Rahman, end the ""cult of personality"" at the town hall and investigate and change every aspect of the council with the many good officers who I know have been frustrated and blocked for years.' 'This is not the end, this is only the beginning.' Mr Erlam has criticised the Met for 'not investigating election fraud properly, protecting Rahman and for its failure to, even now, launch a serious investigation at the town hall.' He added:‎ 'I am standing to give the voters of Tower Hamlets a choice. If elected, I will lead the transformation of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and nothing will stop me. The people will decide.' ‎In court last week, the judge hailed the ‘enormous courage’ of Tower Hamlets residents Mr Erlam, 64, Angela Moffat, 47, Azmal Hussein, 63, and Debbie Simone, 44. He said they had faced a ‘potentially devastating’ legal bill if they had lost, adding: ‘They knew Mr Rahman would deploy all his resources to defeat them and they would be portrayed as racists and Islamophobes. And so it proved. The Petitioners have been duly vilified - but they have hung in there. They have been vindicated.’","Retired film maker Andy Erlam will stand to end 'corruption and cronyism'

"The family of Tracey Woodford (above), whose body was found dismembered in a flat in Pontypridd, Wales, have described her as 'very kind-hearted' and 'selfless' A man has been charged in connection with the murder of a woman who was found dismembered at a flat in south Wales. Christopher May, 50, will appear at Pontypridd Magistrates' Court tomorrow charged in connection with the murder of Tracey Woodford, 47. Today, her family described her as 'very kind-hearted' and 'selfless'. Ms Woodford, from the Pontypridd area, is believed to have been attacked in woodland in Pontypridd on Tuesday before being taken back to the property of a man she is thought to have left a town centre pub with, police said. The 47-year-old's body was discovered with 'massive injuries' at the flat around 3pm on Friday afternoon, prompting police to launch a murder investigation. Her family today paid tribute to Ms Woodford, who was last seen by them around 12.45pm on April 21 in Rhydyfelin. They said: 'Tracey was liked and loved by all of her family and friends. She was very kind-hearted and a selfless person who would go out of her way to help anyone. 'Tracey was a gentle person who would not hurt anyone and she will be dearly missed by all who knew her.

"Ed Miliband will announce plans for first-time buyers to pay no stamp duty on properties worth up to £300,000 . First-time buyers will pay no stamp duty on properties worth up to £300,000 and have priority in the sale of new homes under a Labour government, Ed Miliband will say today. Mr Miliband will say Labour’s reduction in the rate of stamp duty to zero would benefit nine in ten first-time buyers – saving them up to £5,000 in tax. Labour claims its tax break – which would last three years – would be funded by a further squeeze on tax avoidance, higher levies on foreign buyers and cuts in tax relief for landlords who fail to keep properties up to standard. A Labour government would also change planning law to give first-time buyers who have lived in a local authority area for more than three years ‘first call’ on up to half of homes built locally. Labour aides say they would have a two-month window in which to buy a home before it was made more generally available in a reform designed to overcome local opposition to housing developments. The policy announcements – Labour’s most eye-catching so far in the campaign – are designed to counter Tory plans to expand Help to Buy loans, the right to buy for housing-association tenants and to offer 200,000 ‘starter homes’, sold at a 20 per cent discount. They are also meant to trump Chancellor George Osborne’s reforms to stamp duty, announced late last year, which have delivered savings for 98 per cent of homebuyers. Mr Osborne’s changes mean there is no stamp duty paid on the first £125,000 of a property purchase, 2 per cent between £125,000 and £250,000 and 5 per cent between £250,000 and £925,000. The changes are paid for by big hikes to duty on more expensive properties. Speaking in Stockton, Co Durham, Mr Miliband will warn of a housing crisis in which a severe lack of homes being built has priced millions out of the property market and left many who want to buy living in private rented accommodation. The rate of home ownership has slipped to its lowest for 30 years, and buy-to-let landlords and foreign investors are snapping up properties before others get a chance. Labour claims it will oversee the construction of a million homes by 2020 and introduce controversial ‘use or lose it’ powers ensuring developers build on land rather than hoarding it. Local authorities will be able to levy council tax on sites which remain undeveloped to try to force developers’ hands. ‘There’s nothing more British than the dream of home ownership, starting out in a place of your own,’ Mr Miliband will say. Mr Miliband will say Labour’s reduction in the rate of stamp duty to zero would benefit nine in ten first-time buyers – saving them up to £5,000 in tax . ‘But for so many young people today that dream is fading with more people than ever renting when they want to buy, new properties being snapped up before local people get a look-in, young families wondering if this country will ever work for them. It is simply too expensive for so many young people to buy a home today, saving up for the deposit, paying the fees and having enough left over for the stamp duty. ‘So we’re going to act so we can transform the opportunities for young working people in our country. For the first three years of the next Labour government, we will abolish stamp duty for all first-time buyers of homes under £300,000.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls insists the party’s plan for stamp duty is ‘fully funded’. Eric Pickles, right, said rent control is the most effective way of destroying a city - bar bombing it . The stamp-duty cut would cost £225million a year. Labour says it would be paid for by tackling tax avoidance by landlords, which HMRC has calculated costs more than £550million each year. A ‘national register of landlords’ will mean this can be cut by at least 20 per cent, generating £100million, Labour claims. It would also increase tax paid by holding companies that buy UK property on behalf of investors and raise stamp duty on buyers from outside the EU. The party would also cut tax relief that rogue landlords get for repairs and upkeep when their properties are not up to standard. Landlords who let furnished properties can claim tax relief even if they are not investing in their property.","Labour’s reduction in stamp duty would benefit nine in ten first-time buyers .

"Billionaire Phones4U founder John Caudwell has revealed that his £10million mansion is 'being haunted' by the 'ghost' of a child killed in the English Civil War. Mr Caudwell, 62, claimed visitors to his 50-room Jacobean manor in Staffordshire have felt a bed vibrate and a ghost brushing past them on the stairs. The businessman believes the ghostly goings-on are being caused by the spirit of a terrified little boy who died in the 17th century conflict. Scroll down for video .

Mr Caudwell, who sold off Phones4U in 2006 for £1.4billion, said: 'The little boy was alone in the house. All the men had gone out hunting - and the Cromwellians came down the drive. 'He shouted: 'We are for the king' - and one of the soldiers lifted a musket and shot him dead. 'He fell in the Long Gallery, crawled into one of the bedrooms and bled to death. 'Legend has it that every so often, those blood stains come oozing through. 'I've never seen that but there's a strange thing where several women have slept in the room and felt the bed vibrate. I was not there at the time. 'There are also stories about this ghost brushing past people on the stairs.

Mixing with the stars: John and Claire with singer Stephen Gately at a charity ball in May 2009, just five months before the Boyzone singer was found dead at his holiday apartment in Majorca . Historic: Broughton Hall in Staffordshire was the scene of a Civil War tragedy according to Mr Caudwell . The English Civil War took place between 1642 and 1651. It was fought by the Cavaliers - who remained loyal to King Charles I - and the Roundheads, who wanted to overthrow the monarchy. Their battles saw Charles I being executed, his son, Charles II, being exiled and Oliver Cromwell taking over as the leader of a republic Britain in 1649. Cromwell died in 1958 from suspected septicemia - and he was buried with great pomp at Westminster Abbey. But in 1661, a year after the monarchy was restored, his body was exhumed and subjected to a 'posthumous execution'. Mr Caudwell, who is ranked as the 42nd richest person in Britain, bought Broughton Hall 20 years ago for £800,000. The house and its 28-acres, which are near Eccleshall, are now worth more than £10million. The businessman started work at the age of 17 on the production line of the Michelin factory in his home city, Stoke-on-Trent, for just £3 a week. He began his mobile-phone empire in 1987. Earlier this month he spent £155million buying the Audley Street garage in Mayfair, central London. He plans to knock it down and build a high-end housing complex worth as much as £2billion. The apartment block will contain five townhouses, three penthouses, a mews home and 21 luxury flats - rivalling properties such as the nearby One Hyde Park for the title of the world's most desirable living space. Mr Caudwell also made headlines earlier this year when he was granted planning permission to build his own steam railway in the grounds of Broughton Hall. Mr Caudwell at the mansion in 2009. He has lived there for 20 years after making his money from the mobile-phone company Phones4U. A half-sized locomotive will haul a fleet of fully furnished carriages, at an initial cost of £500,000. Mr Caudwell said at the time: 'It's a mad idea - crackpot really. I'll probably only use the railway two or three times a year but I've had a fascination with steam trains since I was a boy.' No doubt they will be enjoyed by his family of five children by three women. He split from his last long-term partner, Claire Johnson, last year. The couple had been together for 15 years and remain friends. Mr Caudwell is also friends with his former wife Kate, to whom he was married for 25 years. There are several family suites in Broughton Hall to accommodate them and Mr Caudwell's other visitors. He also has an £80million mansion in Mayfair and two luxury ski chalets - one in Vail, in the US, and the other in Whistler, Canada.","John Caudwell says the boy was shot and crawled into a bedroom to die .

"The acting chief executive of the Clinton Foundation acknowledged that the global philanthropy made mistakes in how it disclosed its donors amid growing scrutiny as Hillary Rodham Clinton opens her presidential campaign. The fund had been facing allegations of improper behavior after reports surfaced about undisclosed donations from foreign governments and a donor who was selling his uranium company to a Russian state agency at the same time the State Department had to approve the sale. Acting CEO Maura Pally defended the foundation's work and reaffirmed its commitment to transparency, describing its policies on donor disclosure and contributions from foreign governments as 'stronger than ever.' However, the tempered apology came the same day that a government watchdog said that the charity seemed like a 'slush fund' for one of America's most powerful political families. The acting CEO of the Clinton Foundation apologized after Hillary Clinton's presidential candidacy put it under intense scrutiny for undisclosed donations. Above, Clinton speaks at a foundation event in December . Maura Pally (left) said that money received from a businessman when he was seeking State Department approval for selling his company to Russia (right) could not be disclosed under Canadian law . Pally said the foundation expected to refile some of its tax forms, following a voluntary external review, because it had 'mistakenly combined' government grants and donations. She said the foundation would 'remedy' any errors but stressed the total revenue was reported accurately and that grants were properly broken out on audited statements on its website. 'Yes, we made mistakes, as many organizations of our size do, but we are acting quickly to remedy them, and have taken steps to ensure they don't happen in the future,' she said. Pally also described the foundation's work with the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, which she said received funding from a separate organization in Canada. The partnership received more than $2million in donations from the Canadian chairman of Uranium One, Ian Telfer, when it was being sold to Russian state atomic agency Rosatom. Telfer's donations, given by his own foundation, came at the same time as the State Department, then headed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, helped approve the sale. The transaction, which followed Bill Clinton helping businessman Frank Giustra secure some of the Kazakh uranium sites also being sold, needed to be vetted by a government committee because it gave one-fifth of US uranium production into foreign hands. Pally's blog post said that the Giustra partnership does not disclose its donors because under Canadian law they are not disclosed without prior permission from each donor. 'This is hardly an effort on our part to avoid transparency,' she said. The apology said that Uranium One Chairman Ian Telfer's donations to a foundation partnership with Frank Giustra (right) would have needed prior permission to be disclosed. Above, Giustra and Bill Clinton . A non-profit rating agency has placed the Clinton Foundation on a watch list. Above, the New York Times's David Leonhardt (left), philanthropist Melinda Gates (center) and Hillary Clinton . Despite the apology, a fellow at the nonpartisan government watchdog Sunlight Foundation questioned the foundation and the Clintons' association with it, according to the New York Post. 'It seems like the Clinton Foundation operates as a slush fund for the Clintons,' Sunlight's Bill Allison said. The Clinton Foundation is said to have taken more than $140million in grants and pledges in 2013, spending $84.6 million on 'functional expenses' including payroll and just $9million on direct aid. The foundation, which was also placed on a watch list by the non-profit rating organization Charity Navigator, said that the excess money is in pledges rather than hard assets. Though the rating organization said it 'takes no position on allegations made or issues raised by third parties' it said on its website that it 'has determined that the nature of this/these issue(s) warrants highlighting the information available so that donors are aware of the issues in question'. Charity Navigator also refused to rate the foundation, citing insufficient methods to gauge its 'atypical business model'. Since announcing her run for president, Clinton has sought to dismiss questions about financial support of her family charity and allegations of undue influence as 'distractions and attacks' by Republicans seeking to discredit her. Pally said 'So yes, we made mistakes, as many organizations of our size do, but we are acting quickly to remedy them, and have taken steps to ensure they don't happen in the future'. The philanthropy was started in 2001 by former President Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea will be starting a nine-day trip to Africa on Wednesday to highlight the group's work on issues such as economic growth and empowerment, climate change and empowering women and girls.","Acting Clinton Foundation CEO Maura Pally said 'Yes, we made mistakes'

Lord Greville Janner - the Labour peer accused of molesting young boys in the 1970s and 1980s - could be tested by experts to prove he has dementia as part of civil claims brought by his alleged victims, a lawyer has said. The family of the 86-year-old politician has been told he will not face child abuse charges because of his memory problems, but he could still face civil action from complainants. Legal firm Slater & Gordon are representing several people looking to take private action against Lord Janner, with police having identified 25 people who say the Labour peer attacked them. Each could claim up to £100,000. Lord Janner has been accused of preying on young boys at three Leicester care homes between 1969 and 1989, with prosecutors arguing there is 'overwhelming' cause to charge the former MP with 22 sex attacks on nine victims - the youngest aged just 10 at the time. Richard Scorer, head of the abuse team at Slater & Gordon, told Jamie Doward at The Observer newspaper that they were investigating the prospect of having Lord Janner examined by third-party expert witnesses. 'I have certainly dealt with civil claims before where the alleged abuser has claimed to have dementia and we have been able to have them medically examined in relation to that,' he said. 'It is something we could consider doing. It would depend on the detailed evidence that is available about his medical condition but, potentially, there is provision in the civil law for us to do that.' The director of public prosecutions Alison Saunder when she decided not to pursue the charges of historic sex abuse. She said there was 'no public interest' in prosecuting Lord Janner because of his dementia, adding that his illness made him unfit to plead - amid accusations of a 45-year cover-up over his alleged actions. Scroll down for video . Prosecutors say there is substantial cause to charge Lord Janner with 22 charges of sexual assault on nine victims, but the director for public prosecutions sad the extent of his dementia made him unfit to face trial . Lord Janner with the Queen in 2003. In the same month his Westminster office was raiding by police the deeds to his £2million house were transferred to his children. Lawyers are questioning the extent of his dementia . Ms Saunder admitted that Lord Janner should have been prosecuted on three separate occasions - in 1991, 2002 and 2007, but botched investigations each time meant he escaped a prosecution. The CPS has been accused of double standards, after a MailOnline investigation revealed that at least 19 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010, including 10 in the last year. Lord Janner voted in the House of Lord 210 times between his Alzheimer's diagnosis and the end of 2013, leading some to suggest he could have been prosecuted if authorities had acted sooner. His alleged victims will be seeking compensation if evidence of wrongdoing is uncovered. The family of Lord Janner say he is innocent. However, this has been made more difficult since Lord Janner transferred ownership of his Hampstead Heath flat, estimated to be worth around £2million, in March 2014. The transfer took place in the same month that police raided the politician's office in Westminster . Director of public prosecutions Alison Saunders has come under fire for refusing to prosecute Lord Janner after saying his dementia would make him unfit to plead - admitting he should have been prosecuted before . Slater & Gordon represents 168 of Jimmy Savile's victims and 10 of former Liberal MP for Rochdale Cyril Smith. Mr Scorer said he believes it is 'outrageous' that allegations of sex abuse are only being investigated now, adding that the transfer of Lord Janner's assets would not put off the clients from pursuing legal actions. 'The question I would ask is: if he actually has dementia, on what basis does he have the capacity to transfer ownership of assets?' he said. There appears to be a contradiction between saying on the one hand that 'he has dementia' and on the other that he has been able to effect a transfer of assets. 'If there's evidence that the transaction has been done to avoid potential creditors that is something we could challenge.'","No criminal charges against 86-year-old but alleged victims could sue .

"It's the ultimate in slow-motion footage. The BBC is to air a two-hour, real-time documentary following a canalboat as it pootles its way along a British waterway at a leisurely 4mph. For many, the languid film will be as interesting as watching paint dry, but the Corporation hopes many viewers will find it a refreshing change from the usual frenetic pace of modern TV. There is no presenter, narrator, dialogue or music, so all viewers will hear are the sounds of the boat's engine, the lapping of the water and the local birdsong as the barge makes its way along a picturesque stretch of the Kennet and Avon Canal. 00.00: And they're off! 0-4mph in ten minutes . 34.07: Bridge over (not at all) troubled water . 41.50: Crazy boy racers scream past at 5mph . Aside from two aerial cutaway shots, when the boat negotiates a lock and crosses the Dundas Aqueduct, the full two hours is shot continuously from a single camera on the front of the boat. Rather incongruously, it's the same specialist high-definition equipment used to shoot the action-packed James Bond blockbuster Skyfall. In contrast, the most exiting moments of All Aboard! The Canal Trip involve the narrowboat being overtaken by a swan, or having to manoeuvre out of the way of a pleasure craft. Other exciting scenes feature a plank of wood, a dog-walker and cyclists on the towpath. The film was shot on a sunny day last month and will air on May 5 as part of the BBC Four Goes Slow series of deliberately unrushed programmes. Producer Luke Korzun Martin said: 'We want the voyage to feel like a sensory experience. We want it to be mesmeric, hypnotic and beautiful. 'The idea was to create a moving painting. It is like a Constable landscape which changes in front of your eyes. If people are going to sit and watch a two-hour single shot, it needs to be the most beautiful two-hour shot it can be.' Rob Dean, of the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust, said: 'I think this is the right approach. The whole point about the waterways is they slow people down.' 55.40: Mayday! Mayday!

"A mutilated fox: hardly the most glamorous prop Ashley James has ever posed with, but in this case, that is precisely the point. The former Made In Chelsea star has joined forces with animal rights crusaders PETA on a hard-hitting anti-fur campaign directed at Harvey Nichols after the national department store abandoned its ten-year anti-fur policy. 'Harvey Nichols: Here's the Rest of Your Fur Coat,' the slogan reads, alongside an image of the 26-year-old animal lover, who is brandishing what appears to be a skinned fox - a fake one we've been assured. Scroll down for video . Dark: The former Made in Chelsea star has joined forces with animal rights crusaders PETA on a hard-hitting anti-fur campaign directed at Harvey Nichols after it abandoned its fur-free policy - (the fox isn't real) PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) is currently in talks with a number of billboard companies in the hopes of getting the poster mounted outside Harvey Nichols. 'I love animals,' Ashley told MailOnline. 'Having educated myself about the fur industry, it breaks my heart to think people allow such cruelty to continue by buying fur products.' Harvey Nichols, which has 12 locations around the world and previously stood against the fur industry, backtracked last year when it quietly re-introduced it. Priced between £300 and £1,500, the department store's current range includes coyote fur courtesy of Canada Goose, raccoon fur from Charlotte Simone and plenty of rabbit pelts from Vince. 'When I see people I know wearing fur, I will initiate the conversation by asking them if it's real or not. If they confirm that it's real, I express disgust,' Ashley said, . 'If they are interested, then I will tell them more about this cruel industry. I just want people to make informed decisions with their purchases. Anti-fur: 'I love animals,' Miss James, pictured, tells MailOnline. 'Having educated myself about the fur industry, it breaks my heart to think people allow such cruelty to continue by buying fur products' Boycotter: Miss James, pictured in London this week, leads a mostly vegan lifestyle and shops at fur-free stores including Liberty London, Selfridges, House of Fraser, Topshop and Oasis . 'If they know about the industry and still choose to wear fur, then that's fine - although I can't personally understand how they could do that. 'But I think a lot of people prefer to live in ignorance, and that's really frustrating.' In a statement to MailOnline, Harvey Nichols said: '[We are] committed to sustainable and responsible practice across all areas of [our] business, and ethical trading is an important part of this programme. 'We only source products from reputable brands, which includes seeking the assurance that the fur they use in products has been sourced responsibly.' However, in a recent exposé fronted by Paloma Faith, PETA went undercover on 'Origin Assured' fur farms, a label which is meant to give fur-stocking stores assurances about the animal welfare and conditions in which animals are bred and slaughtered. It found raccoons, rabbits and minks kept in filthy wire cages, sometimes alongside the rotting corpses of other animals. 'These animals were left to suffer from untreated injuries, including missing limbs,' PETA reports. 'Frightened and distressed, they often mutilate themselves and others in the cage, only to be slaughtered in the name of fashion.' Party line: In a statement, Harvey Nichols said, 'We only source products from reputable brands, which includes seeking the assurance that the fur they use in products has been sourced responsibly' Put a name to the face: Priced between £300 and £1,500, Harvey Nichols' current designer range includes fur from coyotes (left), raccoons (center) and foxes (right) When MailOnline asked reps at Harvey Nichols to clarify their position on exactly what made them change their minds on their anti-fur policy, communication ceased and they declined to make any further comment. PETA's foundation director Mimi Bekhechi points out: 'All fur is the product of a bloody, violent industry. We encourage consumers not to be deceived by Harvey Nichols' claims of selling 'humanely and ethically' obtained furs.' Before Ashley James knew anything about the industry, she admits she owned a rabbit fur coat. 'Needless to say I don't any more,' she said. 'I gave it to a Romanian charity called K-9 Angels, which use donated furs to keep rescued dogs warm in winter.' Cruelty-free: Miss James is a particular fan of designer Stella MCartney, who has been a lifelong vegetarian and refuses to even use leather in her collections.

Ashley, who now leads a mostly vegan lifestyle, praises designers like Stella McCartney, another avid anti-fur protester, and shops at fur-free stores including Liberty London, Selfridges, House of Fraser, Topshop and Oasis. Harvey Nichols is not the only entity, or person, to have broken its anti-fur promise. Supermodel Naomi Campbell, who once posed for PETA’s infamous ‘I’d rather go naked than wear fur’ campaign, then went on to become the face of fur couturier Dennis Basso in 2010.

Still, notable celebrities who strictly avoid fur include, but are not limited to; Natalie Portman, Abbie Cornish, Jessica Chastain, Sia, Charlize Theron, Pamela Anderson, Pink, Kesha, and Ellen DeGeneres.

"A British policeman has been left paralysed from the waist down after breaking his neck while on holiday with his family. Luke Stanwick, 30, is fighting for his life in a medically-induced coma and may never walk again after the 'horrendous' accident in Portugal. The police officer from Hailsham, East Sussex, was on holiday with his wife Jenny and their two-year-old son, Nathan, when he broke his neck. Mrs Stanwick said: 'He is my rock, my hero and most of all the man I adore without question. PC Luke Stanwick, 30, has been left paralysed from the waist down after breaking his neck while on holiday with his family, pictured with his two-year-old son Nathan . 'Luke is outgoing and fun to be around and makes me smile every day, even now in our darkest moment together. 'He will fight to the ends of the earth to recover as much as he physically can for both me and our son, as well as the rest of his family.' He remains in hospital in the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, where he was put into a coma for extensive surgery. His father, Michael Stanwick, 62, said it was too early to know whether Luke's injuries will leave him permanently disabled. He said: 'Luke's still in hospital, he's suffered a broken neck. He's undergone extensive surgery and he is now in the recovery ward. 'He's undergoing physiotherapy treatment and he is on extensive pain relief. He's able to move his arms now, but it's early doors. A donation page, set up by close friend and former Metropolitan Police colleague Alison Cat, has collected more than £8,000 so far . 'There are very, very faint signs of recovery. We're trying to get him to the appropriate facilities in this country but we don't know what the damage to the nerve is. 'There is a significant language barrier so it's quite an isolating experience but Luke is very fit, he's a very fit young man and he and I go to the gym together. 'Hearing the news was the most devastating news, we are slowly coming to terms with it. 'It's sad that these shocking things can happen right out of the blue. It brings too much pain to talk about.' The police officer's mother Stephanie Stanwick, 64, who has a medical background, has flown from the UK to be by her son's side. A donation page, set up by close friend and former Metropolitan Police colleague Alison Cat, has collected more than £8,000 so far. It reached a staggering £5,000 in the first day as colleagues at Sussex Police and officers all over the country rallied together using the hashtag £MayTheForceBeWithU. Secretary of the Sussex Police Federation Mark White said: 'We were saddened to hear about Luke's accident and have been doing our best to help him and his family. 'It is too early to say how this will affect him in the long run and we still live in hope that he make a full recovery. 'In the meantime, it is heart-warming to see the efforts which are already underway to raise funds to support Luke and his family.' The Bullshire Police Federation, a website for the police community, shared the GoFundMe page and encouraged officers to help Luke on his road to recovery. On the post, Sean Board wrote: 'I worked on relief with Luke. You couldn't wish to meet a more dedicated officer and family man. 'Come on guys let's dig in and show him his extended family are here for him.' Andrew Smith said: 'Luke worked for me on his arrival in the Met some time ago. A top guy, now is the time he and his family need our support however little people can spare.' Kelly Campbell Jones added: 'Luke and Jen are such a lovely couple. This is a horrible situation but they have so much support and both have the determination to get through this. 'Hope the money helps on Luke's road to recovery.' Graeme McKee said: 'This is awful.

"Ed Miliband (pictured yesterday at the Shree Swaminarayan Temple, north London) is pressing on with his controversial cap rents, despite warnings from experts that plans will backfire . Labour's plans to impose rent controls are ‘economically illiterate’ and will slash investment in new housing, leading to more tenants being evicted by their landlords, experts warned last night. Ed Miliband yesterday confirmed he would press on with controversial plans to cap rents despite warnings from housing experts, business and even Labour figures that they will backfire. He said rent controls – demanded by the militant Unite union that bankrolls Labour – would give millions of ‘forgotten’ renters a fairer deal by helping those stuck in so-called Generation Rent by soaring house prices. But the Generation Rent campaign group said his plans were ‘riddled with loopholes’ and may make tenants’ lives worse. Under the proposals, landlords would have to offer three-year tenancies and would be banned from raising rent above inflation during this time. Alex Hilton, director of Generation Rent, said long tenancies were welcome but the proposal would give landlords an incentive to evict their tenants and would not keep rent down, adding: ‘This is because they have no plans to limit rent rises between tenancies – or after your first three years are up. ‘Worse than this, Labour’s planning new ways for landlords to evict you within that period, for example to sell your home or get it back for other reasons. These loopholes are scary when you think they’re attached to a big financial incentive to use them – because that’s the only way they will be able to put rent up in the first three years.’ In another loophole, hundreds of thousands of properties owned by buy-to-let investors could be excluded altogether. Most buy-to-let mortgages specify maximum tenancies of one year. Labour sources said these landlords would be able to offer short tenancies ‘where contractually obliged’. Senior Tories called the proposal ‘drivel’ and said it would suppress house building and push rents up. Chancellor George Osborne described the plan as a ‘totally economically-illiterate statement that grabs headlines, but is dismissed by every expert who looks at it’. The Confederation of British Industry said the way to tackle the housing crisis was to build more homes, and warned the plans could discourage investment, thereby forcing up rents in the long term. The Labour leader said rent controls – demanded by the militant Unite union that bankrolls Labour – would give millions of ‘forgotten’ renters a fairer deal by helping those stuck in so-called Generation Rent . Senior Tories called the proposal ‘drivel’ and said it would suppress house building and push rents up. Pictured: Mr Miliband and Boris Johnson on the Andrew Marr show today . Some senior Labour figures also have concerns, with former minister Tessa Jowell warning against a cap last week, saying: ‘Before taking a step like that you have to be clear it doesn’t have unintended consequences.’ Yesterday, however, she insisted she supported the plan. Housing spokesman Emma Reynolds was forced on the back foot yesterday after footage emerged of her in 2013 saying: ‘I don’t think rent controls are going to work in practice.’ Yesterday, she said she meant ‘Seventies-style controls’ and said Labour’s plan was different. Rent controls were widely blamed for a reduction in rented housing in Britain and Europe in the Seventies as investment dried up. The bad old days: A Manchester slum . Rent controls have already proved a disaster in Britain after they were introduced in the First World War. The measure was supposed to be temporary – but was only dismantled by Margaret Thatcher in the Eighties. During this time the private rented sector collapsed from 90 per cent of the country’s housing stock to less than 10 per cent. By the Seventies, rent controls were widely blamed for the slum conditions in much of Britain’s remaining private rented stock. Landlords, unable to make a sustainable return, neglected homes and dragged their feet over the most basic repairs. Unscrupulous operators such as Peter Rachman, whose name became a byword for exploitation, drove out tenants who had legal rent protection to replace them with others who were not covered by the law. Gordon Brown’s favourite economist Paul Krugman, a Nobel prize-winner, has warned that attempts to control rent always fail, writing: ‘Almost every freshman-level textbook contains a case study on rent control, using its known adverse side-effects to illustrate the principles of supply and demand.’ The socialist Swedish economist Assar Lindbeck once said: ‘Next to bombing, rent control seems in many cases to be the most efficient technique for destroying cities.’ Alan Ward, of the Residential Landlords Association, warned that rent controls could result in a return to the ugly conditions of the past, adding they ‘would lessen investment in new homes when we need more and serve only to paper over cracks in the market’. He said: ‘For some, it is easier to achieve a cheap political point by calling for rent controls than provide a prescription for growth in the private rented sector. Ultimately, tenants would lose as they find themselves forced into slums rented by Rachman landlords operating outside the legal market.’ David Cox, of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, said rent controls led to a fall in supply and the standard of homes because ‘landlords do not have the money to invest in ongoing maintenance’. Sam Bowman, of the Adam Smith Institute think-tank, said rent controls were ‘a stunningly bad idea that could clobber renters’. He said they would give landlords a huge incentive to raise rents at the start of a tenancy, adding: ‘Labour has unwittingly announced a policy that could devastate cities and exacerbate the housing crisis.’ The Institute of Economic Affairs said the proposal ‘would result in higher rents, a reduction in the quality of rented property and in the supply of homes to rent without improving affordability’.

"Holocaust survivors have gathered at the site of the former Bergen-Belsen concentration camp to commemorate the anniversary of its liberation. More than 72,000 camp inmates and prisoners of war died at the Nazi camp including diarist Anne Frank and her older sister Margot. British soldiers liberated the camp on April 15, 1945. Today, seventy years on, hundreds of people sobbed as they laid flowers and flags as memorials. Scroll down for video . Survivor Marie Vaislic from France sits on a mass grave reading '1000 dead rest here' after the ceremony. It was held to mark the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in northern Germany . Officials also attended the ceremony including Joachim Gauck, the German president, who said the British soldiers were 'ambassadors of a democratic culture who were not looking for revenge'. He added: 'We commit ourselves to the obligation of never denying these crimes and of preserving the memories of the victims.' Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, also attended the memorial. He told an audience: 'Right now, we stand on one of the largest Jewish cemeteries in the world. But there are no gravestones, there are no markers. An elderly woman covers her mouth in disbelief as she looks at the mourning wall at the former concentration camp, where more than 72,000 camp inmates and prisoners of war died . Red and white roses, yellow tulips and stones lay on and in front of the gravestone of diarist Anne Frank and her older sister Margot . Women and men mourn as wreaths of blue, white, red and yellow flowers are laid on the memorial. British soldiers took over the camp on April 15, 1945 . Joachim Gauck, the German president pictured (above) during the ceremony, said the British soldiers who liberated the camp were 'ambassadors of a democratic culture' 'The victims buried here lost not just their lives; the Nazis took their identities as well.' Lauder also warned that anti-Semitism is on the rise again in Europe, 70 years after the end of the Holocaust. 'Today, 70 years after this camp was liberated, we hear the same anti-Semitic lies. 'Today, a Jewish boy wearing a yarmulke cannot walk down the street in Paris or London or Copenhagen without fearing for his life.' Anne Frank's diary recounts how her family went into hiding from the Nazis in the Netherlands during the Second World War. It became a bestseller when it was published at the end of the war. The book documents how Anne, her sister Margot and her family went into hiding in a canal house. They were eventually betrayed and sent to Bergen-Belsen, where she and her sister died. After the war the Dutch government set the official date of Anne's death as March 31, based on survivors accounts stating that the girls died sometime in March. But some accounts suggest that she might have died in the middle of February - just two months before British soldiers liberated the camp. It is likely she caught typhus, which was rife in the overcrowded camp. Her sister Margot also passed away and experts think she too had the disease. Their grave, which reads Margot Frank 1926 - 1945 and Anne Frank 1929 - 1945, is a poignant memorial that still stands where the Nazi camp used to be. Red and white roses, yellow tulips and stones were laid carefully around the grave earlier today.

British soldiers freed around 60,000 prisoners but discovered tens of thousands of bodies of people who had died from extreme overcrowding, disease and starvation. Typhus, which Miss Frank is thought to have died from, was particularly rife. Ceremonies have been held across Germany and Poland throughout the spring marking the advance of Allied troops as Nazi Germany neared defeat. They are even more poignant this year because of the dwindling number of survivors and witnesses to the Holocaust, the murder of six million Jews by the regime of Adolf Hitler. Ceremonies were also taking place today at the former Flossenbürg camp in southern Germany, where around 30,000 people died between 1938 and 1945.

"Off target: It has been claimed the G36 (pictured) does not shoot straight when it overheats at 30C . The G36 was created for the requirements of the German armed forces but it is also used as an infantry weapon in around 50 countries. It is used in Britain by counterterrorism police. First made: 1995 . Calibre: 5.56 mm x 45 . Magazine capacity: 30 rounds . Weight: 3.63kg . Length:  755-1,002mm . Use in the UK: Between 2,000 and 3,000 G36 rifles belong to police forces across the country . An assault rifle used by counter-terror police does not shoot straight when it gets hot, tests claim. The Heckler & Koch G36 is inaccurate by up to 20 feet at long range when temperatures top 30C, it was found. The weapon also becomes unreliable when it is left in direct sunlight, exposed to humidity or fired repeatedly, according to a confidential report. The findings have prompted an urgent inquiry into the German-made firearm, which is used by law enforcement officers across the UK. Britain's police forces use a short-barrelled version of the weapon known as the G36C – and have a total arsenal of up to 3,000. Counter-terror and armed response unit officers use them when they need more firepower than the 9mm pistols or carbines they usually carry. Now experts at the Home Office's Centre for Applied Science and Technology (CAST) will lead the inquiry after Germany said the rifle had 'no future' with its military. A leaked report commissioned by Berlin's defence ministry said the precision and accuracy of the G36 deteriorated when it overheated, either because of the temperature or rapid fire. It concluded that when the atmospheric temperature reached 30C (86F), bullets missed their mark by about 50cm (20 inches) at a range of 200m (220 yards) and by up to six metres – about 20ft – over 500m (546 yards). Reports in the German media claimed it also started to become seriously inaccurate after it fired just two magazines – about 60 rounds. Heckler & Koch denies the weapon is inaccurate. But Britain's National Police Chiefs' Council has asked CAST to consider the findings. Simon Chesterman, spokesman on armed policing, said: 'The reliability of any weaponry that the police service uses is of paramount importance.' Superintendent Kevin Carter, of the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, which guards Britain's atomic plants, said it had not experienced problems but added: 'We will monitor the situation and await advice from CAST.' UK police are said to be desperate for a new firearm to help curb the threat of terrorists carrying high-velocity automatic weapons and using body armour. Officers are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain their ageing armoury and are concerned by the discovery of heavy weapons among criminal gangs. Under review: Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman (pictured), the spokesman on armed policing at the National Police Chiefs' Council, has said the findings will be referred to the Home Office for urgent review . In service: The weapon is used by police forces across the UK. They have a total arsenal of between 2,000 and 3,000 G36C rifles, a version that has a shorter barrel than Heckler & Koch's standard-issue rifle . The G36, created in the early 1990s for German troops, is also used in around 50 other countries. British Special Forces used it in Iraq but reports surfaced in 2012 that G36s used by German soldiers in Afghanistan would overheat during prolonged firefights. In the German report, experts tested 304 rifles – including the short-barrelled version – and found none passed precision tests. They concluded: 'The causes for the reduced accuracy do not lie in one of the components... but rather in the whole system.' Lieutenant-Colonel Markus Thull, of the German defence ministry, said the G36 was now 'not fit for purpose'. Andreas Heeschen, of Heckler & Koch, said the rifle complied with its original specifications, but a gun 'designed for the Cold War' did not meet current requirements. He added that the company had received no complaints from the 50 countries where the weapon is used but vowed to assist with the UK review.","Leaked report suggests G36 rifle did not shoot straight when it overheated .

"Americans who were on Mount Everest when it was hit by a deadly avalanche have described the moment the wall of snow and ice hit their camp and the carnage that surrounded them during the aftermath. At least 17 climbers, including three Americans, and many sherpas died as a result of the earthquake that has killed 2,500 people across the Himalayas. Some people managed to survive, but others are still trapped on the mountain waiting to be rescued. Scroll down for video . Jon Reiter, a contractor from Kenwood, California, was attempting his third ascent to the summit when the avalanche hit. He described how he tended for the injured even after doctors told him there is little chance they will survive . Scott Holder, a financial adviser from Santa Rosa, California, and Jon Reiter, a contractor from nearby Kenwood in Sonoma County, were caught up in the deadly avalanche. Reiter, who was making his third attempt at the summit, called is wife Susan by satellite phone, The Press Democrat reported. He described how he was given medicine to give to the injured, but one doctor told him: 'Don’t worry, you are just comforting these people. Most of them are not going to survive.' Saying he had a 'pretty rough day' Saturday, he added during an interview with CNN that he was forced to zip a dead body into a sleeping bag. She then posted on his blog about what had happened. 'He said that the ground shook for a very long time and that avalanches were happening one right after another on the mountain, ' she wrote. 'We just talked for a minute and he got off the phone because he and his climbing partner Moises are helping with the rescue effort. Jon and Moises don't have medical training but they are acting as medics because so many people are injured. 'He said that most of base camp was damaged. All the IMG (International Mountain Guides) group tents are being used as temporary medical facilities for the injured. ' Jon also spoke to CNN on Sunday, saying: 'We're feeling pretty lucky today.' Holder managed to escape the carnage - having to leave the mountain with a severe head cold one day before the earthquake hit. He said: 'God definitely had his hand in my survival. My cold took me out of the danger zone. I guess you could say God gave me a cold.' Ashleigh Stumler from Charlotte, North Carolina, thought she was getting dizzy as she hiked on Mount Everest, but a guide soon informed her it was an earthquake.

As she makes her way down from the mountain, she is hoping to help survivors and is gathering contacts in the United States in a bid to raise funds. 'These have been some of the most incredible, strong people I've ever met in my entire life. Just good people and they are in dire need of help.' Melissa Arnot, who was set to be only the second woman to climb Everest without oxygen checked in via sattellite phone to say her team was safe on Saturday. Among mountaineers thought to have died in the disaster is 33-year-old Google executive and a former medical student doctor offering care at the site while a filmmaker recording a documentary at the base camp was also killed. American Google executive Dan Fredinburg was the first confirmed fatality on the mountain yesterday. Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, was also killed when ice and rock crushed the 18,000-foot-altitude base camp where she worked as a medic for Madison Mountaineering. A third American, Tom Taplin, 61, who owned TET Films & Photography, was making a documentary when the earthquake hit, NBC News reported. His wife Corey Fryer told the station he died 'doing what he loved'. It is the worst natural disaster Nepal has seen in 81 years, and the highest death toll ever recorded on Everest. Before now, the mountain's deadliest year was 2014, when 16 people died in one day.

"A young waitress has claimed that England footballer Aaron Lennon grabbed her, slapped her and ripped her top as he partied in the VIP suite of a nightclub. The 18-year-old reportedly fled to the toilet in tears and afterwards told police that the £55,000-a-week Tottenham winger had left her with a bruise below her eye. The 28-year-old, who is on loan to Everton, was reportedly interviewed by officers under caution over the alleged assault earlier this month. A teenage waitress claims England footballer Aaron Lennon (pictured playing for Everton) grabbed her, slapped her and ripped her top . After taking part in Everton's 1-0 win at home against Southampton on April 4, Lennon is thought to have headed to Suede nightclub in Manchester with friends. Lennon, who has 21 England caps, lives in a penthouse apartment in the city centre. That night, the venue, which is popular with Premier League footballers, was packed with hundreds who had come to see singer Trey Songz perform. But later in the evening, the waitress claimed to have been attacked by the player in the VIP section - where booths cost £2,000. She was interviewed by Greater Manchester Police four days later. A source told The Sun's Michael Hamilton and Dean Wilkins that the girl, who is 'very pretty', had worked at the club for just under a year. He added that the footballer and his friends were 'spending a lot of money on drinks'. Police are investigating the alleged incident at Suede nightclub (pictured) in Manchester which is popular with Premier League stars. On the night of April 4, singer Trey Songz (right) performed at the venue . 'She got really upset, left what she was doing and rushed to the toilet,' the source said. 'She came out about an hour later and was annoyed security had not done anything and kicked Lennon out. 'She says he grabbed her and ripped her top and then slapped her.' On April 15, the day before Lennon's 28th birthday, he was interviewed by police officers on suspicion of assault. Police confirmed no arrests were made and an investigation is ongoing.

"Disneyland has captured the imaginations for generations since its opening in 1955, but there is much that many people do not know about this magical place. Chris Strodder has created a handy book, The Disneyland Book of Lists, which contains over 200 lists crammed full of secrets known and those more obscure. You will find out how many people have given birth in Disneyland, California, what the official pet food brand is, and how the ladies' heels got stuck in melting pavement on the opening day. Here, MailOnline Travel looks at some of the more unusual facts about the world-famous resort that you may not have known about... Scroll down for video . Disneyland has seen a number of changes since its grand beginning in 1955 to the worldwide popular theme park it is today, pictured here is Sleeping Beauty's Castle back in 1955 (left) and how it looks today (right) 1. Before Disney was opened Walt received a wealth of advice, most of which he ignored. This included building non-revenue attractions (such as Sleeping Beauty's castle), not selling alcohol to increase profits, and for customer convenience, offer multiple entrances and exits). However for a short time guests could get beer with their picnic baskets in the outdoor Holidayland in 1957-1961. 2. In the Fantasyland's Peter Pan ride, as guests fly out of the bedroom window, sometimes the alphabet blocks spell out Disney. 3. On Main Street, there is a tribute to Walt Disney's father, Elias Disney, in a window above the emporium. 4. When Disneyland first opened in California on July 17, 1955, it was predicted that 10,000 people would attend. Celebrities, reporters, employees, and sponsors were given staggered times on their tickets, to ease congestion getting in. However many people arrived earlier than their allotted time, with 20,000 more hopefuls queuing outside for miles around. Walt Disney received a wealth of advice, most of which he ignored before opening his fun park . Disneyland in California is the only theme park designed and built under the direct supervision of Walt Disney . 5. The summer heat on that opening Sunday was so great that some of the newly poured pavement started to soften, and trapped some of the ladies' heels. 6. It was intended that there would be a Peter Pan Crocodile Attraction with live fish. Disney artist Bruce Bushman included the aquarium on his original designs, which depicted guests walking through a crocodile's jaws to get to a marine viewing area. 7. In 1955, an adult ticket cost a mere $1, with additional charges for attractions. Even with the extra costs, the average spend was $2.37 (according to a press release by Disney, and included parking charges of 25 cents, admission, rides, amusements and souvenirs. 8. This cost contrasts strongly with 2015, and tickets are now priced at $99, attractions included. It is estimated that guests spend a whopping 83 times the amount they did in 1955, totalling $196. This includes the $17 parking, admission, souvenirs, and an estimated average food spend of $50. A then and now comparison of Disneyland Park in Anaheim California, with founder Walt Disney pictured left . Luxury has remained a constant through the years at Disneyland in California, enjoyed by thousands each year . Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955 . 9. The first paying guest was a 22-year-old student called Dave MacPherson who queued up at 2am for the opening day for the public. 10. The youngest guests in the park have been zero, as three babies have been born in the parks, the first being born near the Plaza Inn in 1979. 11. Fifteen presidents have visited the parks, but not during office. 12. The total cost for creating Disneyland was $17million, which is nothing when you compare it with the cost of Splash Mountain $75million in 1989, and $100-150million for Indiana Jones Adventure in 1995. While the magic has remained throughout the years at the fun park, rides have developed with the times . All staff are trained to a high level at the park to ensure guests have maximum enjoyment . 13. Many companies have sought to be the official providers for Disneyland over the years. Ones that have been featured as Kal Kan as the official pet food, Orville Redenbacher's being the official popcorn and Wonderbread being the official bread. 14. The parks draw over 16 million tourists nowadays but the least busiest times to come include the first two weeks of November and December, the weeks between Easter and Memorial Day, and the weeks between New Year's Day and Martin Luther King Jr day. 15. On May 2, 2006, the two-billionth customer to attend a Disney park visited Disneyland. 16. The most expensive item in the gift shop to buy is the crystal castle in Crystal Arts which is on sale for $37,500. The total cost for creating Disneyland was $17million, which is nothing when you compare it with the cost of Splash Mountain $75million in 1989 . Disneyland Park has around 16 million tourists a year, but it's worth checking when the least busy times are . 17. There are 24 themed clocks around the parks that actually tell the wrong time. If you are keen to count them all, a couple to get you started are the Big Ben during the Peter Pan ride, which is at 7.15, and Mickey's Toontown City Hall clock which spins quickly. 18. In Minnie Mouse's house there is a shopping list stuck to the fridge which only has various types of cheese listed on it . 19. Unsurprisingly due to the number of snap-happy visitors, in 2014, Instagram named Disneyland as the most geotagged location worldwide. 20. Snow White’s evil witch peeks out the window in the tower above Snow White’s Scary Adventures every 24 seconds. A fresh lick of paint does no harm to ensuring some of the traditional builds maintain their impact . Disneyland is the most geotagged location in the world, which is perhaps no surprise . 21. Only 5 per cent of the plants grown in the park by the Evans brothers were native to California. 22. Disneyland's classic carousel, is fitted with 68 leaping white horses, all of which have individual names and distinctive decorations. 23. Tom Sawyer Island is particularly special as it was said to be the only early Disneyland attraction to be personally designed by Walt, according to Bob Thomas in Walt Disney: An American Original. 24. The Haunted Mansion opened in 1969, but the 1957 plans originally stated for it to be a murderous sea captain who hanged himself. A hanging corpse still be seen early in the attraction.

"Patients who always see the same GP are more likely to have cancer symptoms missed, research has shown. A study found that if doctors know patients well, they could mistake warning signs for ongoing medical problems or depression. The study of 18,500 patients found that people with bowel cancer who saw their normal GP were diagnosed, on average, a week later than others. Patients who always see the same GP are more likely to have cancer symptoms missed, research has shown (posed by model) The findings are worrying because Britain has one of the lowest cancer survival rates in Europe, and this has partly been blamed on family doctors missing symptoms. Even delays of a few weeks can be vital because the cancer can quickly spread to other organs and become very difficult to treat. The study by academics at the University of Bristol and Cancer Research UK compared the records of patients diagnosed with breast, lung and bowel cancer between 2000 and 2009. The findings, published in the British Journal of General Practice, show that seeing the same GP was not linked to a later diagnosis for breast cancer or lung cancer. But for bowel cancer – commonly confused with irritable bowel syndrome or piles – there was an average delay of a week. Researchers said the reason there was no link between breast cancer might be because the symptoms are more obvious. And lung cancer is notoriously difficult to detect because there are often no symptoms in the early stages. But according to the study, doctors who are ‘familiar’ with patients can ‘misattribute’ new symptoms to ongoing medical complaints or even depression. GP and lead researcher Dr Matthew Ridd said: ‘GPs should follow up patients who present with potential cancer symptoms to make sure they receive a timely diagnosis. ‘But your regular doctor might not be the best person to spot those symptoms in the first place. So in some cases getting a second opinion from a different doctor could speed up the time to diagnosis.’ The findings, published in the British Journal of General Practice, show that seeing the same GP was not linked to a later diagnosis for breast cancer or lung cancer (posed by model) Figures last month showed that cancer survival rates in Britain lagged ten years behind those of many other European countries. And last summer Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt pledged to name and shame GPs who fail to pick up on early warning signs and refer patients for urgent tests. Dr Richard Roope, Cancer Research UK’s GP expert, said: ‘These intriguing findings suggest that in some cases a fresh pair of eyes could be better at spotting early signs of cancer. Anything that can be done to support GPs in diagnosing cancer earlier is worth pursuing.’ And Sara Hiom, Cancer Research UK’s director of early diagnosis, said: ‘This study provides a useful insight into how seeing the same doctor could impact the time to cancer diagnosis. Any delay in getting cancer diagnosed has the potential to impact the success of treatment, so it’s vital we do everything possible to help GPs refer patients with potential cancer symptoms without delay.’","Bowel cancer patients who saw normal GP  diagnosed week later than others, study shows .

"The life of a 16-year-old girl stabbed to death at a Connecticut school a year ago on the day of prom was celebrated Saturday by hundreds of people with a road race, fried food and live music. Wearing shirts in Maren Sanchez's favorite color of purple, the crowd filled a baseball field behind Milford's Jonathan Law High School, where she was attacked and killed in a hallway on April 25, 2014. A classmate, Christopher Plaskon, has been charged with murder. After a week of somber remembrances at the school, her classmates and event organizers said the idea was to remember Sanchez on the anniversary of her death as she would have wanted, with smiles and joy. Remembrance: Friends embrace and remember slain student Maren Sanchez on Saturday, April 25, 2015 . Plans: Maren Sanchez, pictured in the dress she had planned to wear to prom, was excited about the dance which was due to attend with her new boyfriend last year . 'I did it': Chris Plaskon is being charged with murder as an adult over the stabbing of Sanchez . 'I don't think there's anything sad about this,' said Darby Hudd, a 17-year-old friend of the slain teen. 'It's such a celebration.' The slaying stunned people around Connecticut and especially in this shoreline city, where Sanchez is remembered as an outgoing person, active in drama and other school activities, who had a kind word for anyone she met. The event included a kickball tournament, bounce houses and a dunk tank, with proceeds benefiting a scholarship program created by Sanchez's mother. The day was bittersweet, with some exchanging long hugs, but organizers said they agreed with Sanchez's mother, Donna Cimarelli, that the community did not need another vigil. 'We've cried a lot in this town. If you knew Maren, she would have embraced an event like this,' said Elena Garet, whose daughter was friends with the teenager. Tragic: This May 2, 2014, file photo shows a girl stopping at a memorial for Maren Sanchez outside Jonathan Law High School, in Milford, Connecticut . Live music: Jonathan Law senior Rachel Escobar and Steve Gonza, of the band Ink, practice a piece of original music written for Maren Sanchez . Mourning friends: Jonathan Law High School senior Jarrod Butts and Jamie Loma, left, and Jill Bendlak, right, remember Maren Sanchez on Saturday . 'Maren was a girl who brought people together.' The classmate accused of attacking Sanchez with a knife, Christopher Plaskon, has pleaded not guilty. His attorney has said he intends to use an insanity defense. Police have said they were looking into whether the attack was related to Sanchez's refusal to be Plaskon's date to their junior prom. Fran Thompson, the high school principal, said students and faculty are still recovering from the loss of the beloved girl. Over the last week, he said, the school held memorial events and students have been tweeting favorite memories of Sanchez and examples of people showing kindness toward others. All in purple: Students hold hands and remember Maren Sanchez on Saturday, April 25, 2015, while listening to live music during the 'Peace Love & Music From Maren' event . 'This whole year has really changed us a lot,' he said. 'I think it's made us more aware of the importance to remember the good in people, to take a moment and put things in perspective.' The 16-year-old Connecticut student accused of killing Sanchez who turned down his offer to go to prom, told police after the attack: 'I did it,' court documents show. Christopher Plaskon has been charged with murder as an adult over the death of Maren Sanchez, a friend who was killed last year in a hallway of Jonathan Law High School in Milford.","The life of 16-year-old Maren Sanchez stabbed to death a year ago on the day of prom was celebrated on Saturday by hundreds of people .

"There'll be no need to queue up at the gates of Buckingham Palace and crane your neck to discover the sex of the new royal baby. In fact, all you'll need is access to the internet. When Prince George's brother or sister makes their entrance to the world, their arrival will be announced first on Twitter according to a report in The Sunday Times. News of the royal delivery will then also be posted on the traditional easel behind the gates of Buckingham Palace, just like Prince George and Prince William before him - or her. Scroll down for video . When Prince George was born in July 2013 his birth was first announced in an emailed press release... ...before being displayed on the traditional easel inside the gates of Buckingham Palace . When Prince George was born in July 2013 his birth was first announced to journalists in an emailed press release. A formal notice signed by the doctors who delivered him was then taken by police escort to Buckingham Palace  and displayed at the gates to retain 'the theatre' of a genuine royal occasion. A palace spokesman said at the time: 'We wanted to retain some of the theatre of the notice. It is quite important to us that this is done properly and with the degree of dignity that the event demands. This is the birth of a child who will be in line to the throne. It is a rare occasion and it is nice to be able to do it with some historical precedence.' Clarence House also tweeted the news, and the British Monarchy's Facebook page was also updated. Royal sources say the only difference between the birth of Prince George and his brother or sister will be that there will be less ceremony around the delivery of the piece of paper from the Lindo Wing of St Mary's to Buckingham Palace. The signed document is expected to be taken out of a side door and delivered to the palace in an unmarked vehicle. And it's not the first time the Duke and Duchess have chosen Twitter to deliver news. When the couple got engaged in October 2010 the announcement was first made on Twitter the following month. The birth of Prince William was first announced on an easel outside Buckingham Palace in 1982 . Prince William's birth announcement was signed by the doctors who delivered him . With the Duchess due to give birth any day, one gambler has bet £10,000 that she will give birth to a girl. The man, in his late 30s and from Manchester, will collect more than £15,000 in winnings, which includes his original bet, if the royal baby is a princess. Bookmakers Ladbrokes said the anonymous punter normally gambles on horse racing and football, and this is his first bet on the Royal Family. The Duchess in March at one of her last public appearances before the birth of her new baby . The man said: 'I'm not really bothered by the royals, but I'd just had a big win and my missus reckons it's a girl, so that's a good enough reason for me.' Ladbrokes set the odds of the baby being a girl at 8/15 and 11/8 for a boy. William and Kate's fourth wedding anniversary on Wednesday April 29 is now one of the favourite arrival dates at 4/1. Alice remains the favourite girls' name at 5/4, while Charlotte is 5/1. Arthur is the favourite boys' name at 12/1 and James has odds of 20/1. As the wait for the royal baby continues, Prince Harry has a rapidly reducing window of opportunity to meet his new niece or nephew before he returns overseas. He flew back to the UK to attend the London Marathon after commemorating the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign in Turkey. He chatted to St John Ambulance volunteers and handed out medals to winners of the elite races. Harry is scheduled to return to Australia tomorrow. David Cameron has defended William and Kate for opting to use private health services rather than the NHS. Asked if he was disappointed the Royal Family did not use the NHS, Mr Cameron told Murnaghan on Sky News today: 'I think it's a total matter of choice for people - what they use and where they have their babies. 'All I hope and pray for is there'll be happy, healthy news for that wonderful couple and for the whole country.' He added: 'The NHS is superb and I've seen that in my own life in so many different ways but I believe in choice, I believe in people being able to do what they want to do, and as I say I've only got one thought about the royal baby which is a happy and healthy arrival.' The baby will officially be overdue if Kate has not given birth by May 1, and even Kate herself has said the baby is due mid to late April. Parking restrictions outside the Lindo Wing run out after April 30. Some believe labour is influenced by the lunar cycle and the arrival of a full moon, and the next full moon is on May 4. The suggestion is that the moon's gravitational pull affects the amniotic fluid in the same way it affects the water in the sea and rivers. When Kate gave birth last time on July 22, it was the day of a new full moon.","Kate and William to start new royal birth custom .

"Police ignored the sexual abuse of hundreds of young girls because they were too busy chasing Labour crime targets that would earn bonuses for senior staff. Whistleblower Tony Brookes, a former detective who tried to investigate the abuse, said money was diverted away from protecting the children from rape, trafficking and beatings in order to pursue so-called ‘priority crimes’. The offences, which included car crime, were considered crucial for satisfying a target culture introduced by the last Labour government. Now it has emerged the same targets were also linked to performance-related pay for top officers at South Yorkshire Police. Scroll down for video . Police ignored the sexual abuse of hundreds of young girls because they were too busy chasing Labour crime targets that would earn bonuses for senior staff (picture posed by model) It meant that, while young girls suffered heinous abuse at the hands of sex gangs in Sheffield and Rotherham, top brass could have had a perverse incentive to instruct their staff to look elsewhere. The targets have been scrapped by the Tories amid concern they were harming policing. Tory parliamentary candidate Michael Ellis, a former member of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘Labour’s grossly irresponsible obsession with targets led to a perverted sense of priorities whereby senior officers could get bonuses for prioritising car crime while hundreds of young girls were being abused with impunity.’ The first details of the scandal emerged earlier this year when papers from South Yorkshire Police, relating to child abuse in Sheffield, were leaked to the BBC. The documents and the testimony of former officers suggested the force failed to pursue a number of child sexual exploitation inquiries and ignored intelligence that girls as young as 12 were being raped. A copy of a document from the force’s intelligence database detailed more than 200 girls suspected of being sexually exploited. It listed more than 320 men accused of carrying out abuse, mainly between 2007 and 2010. Allegations included rapes, traffickings, child abduction and threats to scald girls by holding kettles of boiling water over them. The alleged victims were aged between 12 and 15 while their abusers included Iraqi Kurds, white British, black British, and men of Pakistani heritage. The dossier by Professor Alexis Jay (pictured) into the Rotherham scandal described how South Yorkshire Police were ‘more focused on dealing with offences such as burglary and vehicle crime’ than child abuse . In most cases, the files suggest there is no evidence police took any action. In 2007, after an investigation led to two Iraqi Kurds being convicted of abuse, officers asked for resources to mount a much wider investigation in Sheffield. Mr Brookes said he asked for £24,000 and was given £16,000. But after spending only half that amount he was told the entire budget had gone. He says the other £8,000 was diverted to spend chasing ‘district priorities, to investigate robbery, burglary and car crime’. These priorities were tied to Home Office targets introduced by Labour in 2002. In Rotherham, the dossier into the scandal there by Professor Alexis Jay described how senior and middle managers at South Yorkshire Police were ‘more focused on dealing with offences such as burglary and vehicle crime’ than tackling child abuse. At least 1,400 girls in the town were left to be abused by Asian men between 1997 and 2013 because the authorities were also too scared to admit there was a race issue, according to her report published in September. A second report by government adviser Louise Casey concluded the establishment in Rotherham ignored child sexual exploitation due to ‘misplaced political correctness’. And Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary found senior South Yorkshire officers prioritised burglary and car crime over victims of abuse. Labour’s crime targets meant forces were aware that chief constables could get the sack if performance was repeatedly inadequate. The link to performance-related pay that has emerged meant senior officers could pocket bonuses worth thousands for catching criminals or reducing the incidence of so-called priority offences. This system has also been scrapped by the Tories. South Yorkshire Police said: ‘Chief officer bonuses were ratified as part of a process overseen by police authorities.’","Police were too busy chasing Labour crime targets to protect young girls .

"A top television producer is suing his ex-wife for more than £300,000, claiming that she lied to him about being the father of her son. Chris Lewis, 68, has brought the unusual court case against 48-year-old former wife Nicola over the child he helped raise as his own for 17 years. In court documents he claims Mrs Lewis had sex with another man only a few months into their marriage, but did not tell him. She had a child – Charlie, now 19 – as a result but led him to believe the boy was his, he argues. Suing ex-wife: Chris Lewis, 68 (left) has accused his former partner Nicola, 48 (right) of duping him about the paternity of her son Charlie . DNA tests now prove that Charlie is not his biological son, he says, and as a result of the deception he suffered loss and damages – and wants compensation totalling £322,400. The claim, made in documents before the High Court in London, says that the pair married in October 1994 and that Mrs Lewis gave birth to Charlie in March 1996. The couple separated in May 1999. Although Charlie subsequently lived with his mother, Mr Lewis says he ‘would see him regularly and make financial contributions towards his maintenance and advancement’. He claims that his ex-wife continued to lead him to believe that he was the boy’s biological father and he was recorded as such on the birth certificate. He was discussed as being the father in the course of the couple’s divorce, with Mrs Lewis signing ‘statements of truth maintaining that was the case’. Everything changed in April 2013, however, shortly after Charlie’s 17th birthday, when both he and Mr Lewis had DNA tests. They are said to have proven beyond doubt that Mr Lewis was not the boy’s father. The court documents claim that Mrs Lewis’s repeated assertions that her ex-husband was the father of her child ‘were made fraudulently’ with her ‘knowing them to be false or not caring whether they were true or false’. Mr Lewis’s lawyers say that Mrs Lewis ‘had sexual intercourse with David Alderson or an unknown person which resulted in the conception of Charlie in or around May or June 1995’. High-profile contract: Mr Lewis's company, Chris Lewis Media, provided coverage of the Equestrian events at the London Olympics and the TV producer brought Charlie to the venue during the games . They add: ‘On no occasion during the parties’ marriage did Mrs Lewis inform Mr Lewis that she had had sexual intercourse with another person/persons. ‘She knew that Mr Lewis was not the biological father of Charlie, or was reckless as to whether he was the biological father, or did not believe he was the biological father. ‘By reason of her deceit and misrepresentations, Mr Lewis has suffered loss and damage, and claims damages plus interest.’ Mr Lewis was for decades one of the BBC’s leading sports producers, masterminding footage of every Olympic Games since 1972 as well as working on coverage of ten football World Cups. Since leaving the BBC in 2006, he has specialised in equestrian sports. He is understood to have taken Charlie to equestrian events at the London 2012 Olympics, which his TV company Chris Lewis Media was filming, a few months before he discovered he was not the boy’s father. Speaking about the court case, Mr Lewis, of Twickenham, South West London, said: ‘It’s been a very hurtful time for all parties.’ Mrs Lewis lives in a £1.2million house in Shepperton, Surrey, and is a company director of a fireplace shop. She told the Daily Mail last night: ‘I haven’t even looked at the document from court, and I can’t say anything because it’s in the hands of my solicitors.’ David Alderson, 59, of Cobham, Surrey, who is alleged to be a former lover of Mrs Lewis and the possible father of her child, was unavailable for comment last night.","Chris Lewis, 68, of London, is suing his ex-wife Nicola, 48, for deception .

"'This is Darko. I think I know the location of $20million worth of stolen art - I hope you have WhatsApp.' It's a line that wouldn't sound out of place in a heist movie. But that was the anonymous call that helped art sleuth Christopher Marinello, 53, track down nine paintings including works by Chagall and Rivera stolen from an LA mansion. 'I got this tip-off from a shadowy figure in Slovenia called Darko,' said the London-based founder of Art Recovery International. Scroll down for video . Art detective Christopher Marinello has tracked down £250million worth of stolen art including this 1920 Henri Matisse painting Le Jardin . 'He sent me images of the paintings via WhatsApp and we set up a sting operation with the LAPD and recovered nine of paintings which were stolen in broad daylight six years ago.' The art detective is no stranger to high profile cases – having been central to the recovery of a £1billion Nazi-looted hoard found in a squalid Munich flat in 2012. He currently represents the heirs of renowned art dealer Paul Rosenberg in their bid to recover Henri Matisse's 1921 Femme Assise. It was discovered amongst other priceless works in a flat owned by Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of Nazi art dealer Hildebrand, and has been valued at around £60million. He is representing the heirs of art dealer Paul Rosenberg in their bid to recover Henri Matisse's 1921 Femme Assise (left) which was found in a squalid Munich apartment along with this Marc Chagall painting (right) 'The painting was found covered by a layer of grime. There was a milky white film on it as it had been sitting flat, unstretched amongst rotting food,' said Mr Marinello. 'It didn't even have a frame, but there is no doubt that it is the original Matisse. It has been tested by a number of experts and the Rosenberg family has an incredibly detailed archive. 'It should clean up nicely and we were able to determine it has not been directly touched since Matisse completed it.' The reclusive eccentric died in May last year and left the collection dubbed the 'greatest find of the post-war era' to Kunstmuseum Bern. The museum announced that it would accept the immense trove of art amassed by a Nazi-era art dealer, but would ensure any looted art was returned to the rightful owners. And just yesterday it emerged that Germany has signed an agreement to return Matisse's Femme Assise to the Rosenberg heirs. In the past two decades, Mr Marinello has tracked down £250million worth of stolen art including priceless works by Picasso, Renoir and Matisse. The founder of Art Recovery International examines evidence relating to Matisse's Le Jardin with head curator Lars Bystrom . He tracked down nine paintings including Les Paysans by Marc Chagall (pictured) stolen from an LA mansion . One of his most recent cases saw him recover El Greco's 1944 'Portrait of a Gentleman', which was seized from Julius Priester's collection by the Gestapo in Vienna. Mr Priester, a prominent art collector, had fled to Paris with his wife Camilla six years before, when Austria was annexed into Germany as part of the Anschluss in 1938. Last month Mr Marinello also tracked down two sculptures which were stolen with weeks of each other from Hirschl and Adler Gallery in New York 32 years ago. Paul Manship's 'Central Figure of Day' was taken during an exhibition in December 1983 and just three weeks later 'Figure of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney' by Prince Paul Troubetzkoy disappeared from the same show. Another of his most high-profile successes was the recovery of Matisse's Le Jardin after it was stolen from the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm by a burglar armed with a sledgehammer. More than 1,400 artworks were found in a squalid Munich flat owned by Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of Nazi art dealer Hildebrand . Criminals are both nemeses and friends to the detective and if you spot him sitting in a Starbucks, the chances are he's about to sit down with an art thief. 'I've met with a criminal who's been holding onto some very valuable artwork for over 30 years several times at a cafe in Paris,' said Mr Marinello. 'I often receive and exchange stolen works in pubs and cafes. In fact if you see me sitting alone in a Starbucks, there is a high likelihood I'm not just having a cup of coffee. I prefer meeting in public places, as it can get interesting. 'I deal with criminals if I have the permission of the authorities. If the theft happened 25 years ago, the police aren't as interested and in those cases I'm given permission to handle the case myself.' Before he became the public face of the company, he used to work undercover and once set up a sting operation to catch a man trying to illegally obtain a Van Gogh picture worth £2million. He has also recovered a multi-million pound Devo painting from the middle of the street in Manhattan from a celebrity who unwittingly came into possession of the stolen artwork. 'I was meeting a well-known celebrity at the corner of a street in New York and suddenly a beige Mercedes Benz pulled up and the window rolled down. Out came a Devo painting rolled up in a tube inside a black plastic bag. 'That is definitely one of the more unusual places I have exchanged artwork.' Finding the missing art in the first place is a major undertaking as Mr Marinello and his team often locate stolen works before law enforcement. To do this, they have developed Art Claim, the world's most technologically advanced database for stolen, looted and missing works of art, antiquity and cultural property. Once a missing artwork is entered into the database, they use image recognition software to scour catalogues at Sotheby's, Bonham's, eBay and other auction sites until they find a match. 'It all starts with Art Claim. Anyone who has a theft whether it's a museum or holocaust victim should report the theft, then we search art fairs, online sellers, and auction catalogues. 'There is a huge risk in buying a stolen work as the legal fees can be back breaking. The publicity alone can be hugely damaging to a high net-worth collector. 'People spend hundreds of thousands and do absolutely nothing to check the provenance. You need to know in advance what you're buying.' Mr Marinello believes art theft is on the rise and said it is now the third highest-grossing criminal trade, behind guns and drugs. Cornelius Gurlitt's father Hildebrand (right), was commissioned to obtain artworks on behalf of Adolf Hitler (left) and bought works confiscated from Jewish families . 'It is worse than ever. The economic downturn over the past few years, security cuts at museums and wars have all contributed to the fact that cultural property theft is on the rise.' But Hollywood-style art heists with James Bond-style equipment and elaborate getaways are not the only way that priceless works disappear. 'Art is stolen in every way imaginable, but it is not always a well thought-out endeavor. 'Some thieves just see a work and think 'I can just put this in my bag and get out of here'. 'What they don't realise is that these works are not at all easy to sell on. Once an artwork is on our database - as this one is - we will be searching art markets all over the world for it. 'Art can also be lost in transport and there is also insider theft. Of course there are also movie-style elaborate break-ins. Methods are getting creative, but we are trying to stay one step ahead.' 'Thieves are always going to be thieves. Art thieves are common thugs. There's no romance there. The same people who'd steal your wallet would steal artwork. 'The Internet has made it easier track but it's easier for the criminals as well.'","Christopher Marinello has tracked down £250million worth of stolen art .

"A night of violence gave way to a day of mourning Sunday for a man who died after sustaining serious injuries while in the custody of Baltimore police. Over several hours on Sunday afternoon, a steady stream of mourners filed into the Vaughn Green East funeral home for a wake for Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old black man who died a week after an encounter with police left him with grave spinal injuries. Mourners passed by Gray's silk-draped, white coffin where he lay dressed in a white shirt, black pants, white sneakers and an all-white Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap. Scroll down for video .

Above the lid to the coffin was a floral arrangement and inside the lid was a pillow with a screen-printed picture of Gray flanked by doves and the quote, 'Peace, Y'all' at the bottom edge. Mourners also gathered outside. Some held up signs that read, 'We remember Freddie' and 'Our Hearts Are With The Gray Family.' Melissa McDonald, 36, who said she was Gray's cousin, wore a shirt with 'Freddie Forever' printed on the back. She described her cousin as a nonviolent person. 'He didn't deserve to die the way he did,' she said. A number of mourners like Tina Covington, 46, said they didn't know the family but came to express their condolences. Covington said she has a son near Freddie Gray's age. Gray was detained on April 12 after he ran away from police. He asked for an inhaler as he screamed in pain during the arrest and requested medical attention, but was denied . Gray, who was arrested for carrying a switchblade knife, died a week after the incident from a severed spine . 'It hits home. It really does. It's a reality check,' said Covington, whose son is 27. Covington said that 'there is something going on in the police department that needs to change.' Gray's funeral is planned for Monday. At a church service earlier Sunday, Pastor Jamal Bryant told churchgoers, including members of Gray's family, at Empowerment Temple AME Church that 'somebody is going to have to pay' for Gray's death. Bryant told churchgoers that if 'you're black in America your life is always under threat.'

Some 34 people were arrested, according to Baltimore Police Department, and six police officers sustained minor injuries. J.M. Giordano, a photo editor at Baltimore's City Paper, said Baltimore police beat him as he covered one of the protests in west Baltimore. A video posted to the newspaper's website Sunday shows at least two police officers in riot gear hitting and kicking Giordano as the person filming screams, 'He's a photographer! He's press!' Sait Serkan Gurbuz, a photographer with Reuters, said police detained him as he was shooting photographs of the scuffle. He declined to comment further. A statement from Reuters said police also cited Gurbuz for failure to obey orders. 'We hope that the department will dismiss the citation and, going forward, respect the First Amendment right of the press to lawfully take images in the public interest,' Reuters said. Gray's wake was held a day after protests in Baltimore turned violent. Above, a man is kicked as he attempts to get up after being knocked down, following a march to City Hall on Saturday . Barricade: Police stand in helmets near Pratt Street after a march to City Hall for Freddie Gray, Saturday, April 25, 2015 in Baltimore . Roughly 1,200 protesters gathered at City Hall on Saturday afternoon, officials said, to protest Gray's death, which has prompted near-daily demonstrations since he died April 19. Gray was arrested one week before that when officers chased him through a West Baltimore neighborhood and dragged him into a police van. However, a smaller group splintered off and looted a convenience store and smashed storefront windows. A protester tossed a flaming metal garbage can toward police officers in riot gear trying to push back the crowd. Earlier, a group of protesters smashed windows of at least three police cars. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a long-time congressman representing Baltimore's 7th District, told CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday that there is deep frustration over the case. 'Mr. Gray died a week ago. And I think the thing that upset so many people was the fact that here's a young man. We still don't know exactly why he was arrested,' Cummings said. 'We do know that he was hollering out for aid. He was not given aid after being arrested. ... A lot of people are very, very frustrated as to trying to figure out what happened here, and it's very upsetting.'

Police acknowledged Friday that Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested — before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt, a violation of the Police Department's policy. Gray was arrested after he made eye contact with officers and ran away, police said. Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into the van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police have said. Gray asked for medical help several times, beginning before he was placed in the van. After a 30-minute ride that included three stops, paramedics were called. Authorities have not explained how or when Gray's spine was injured.","A wake was held for Freddie Gray at Vaughn Green East funeral home in Baltimore, Maryland Sunday afternoon .

"Last week, a handful of British tech fanatics took delivery of the first highly sought-after Apple watches. But it’s only one example of a new generation of watches designed to do far more than just tell the time. And while these smartwatches might sound as if they’re just for tech-savvy geeks, whether you’re a fitness fanatic, want to track your sleep and calorie intake or simply like the idea of checking your emails on your wrist, there’s a watch that could make your life easier. Life & Style investigates . . . BEST FOR BEGINNERS . Pebble watch, from £99, getpebble.com . The Pebble was one of the earliest smartwatches, and since it launched in 2013, more than a million have been sold. It’s easy to see why. It keeps things basic — there are no buttons or whizzy features and you can’t make calls or browse the internet (you have a phone and computer for that). Instead, once connected wirelessly to your phone, you can see who is calling, texting or emailing, without having to get your phone out — though you will need your phone to reply. The battery charge lasts longer than other smartwatches — up to seven days — partly because it uses a low-energy screen (similar to a Kindle) that is readable in daylight). BEST FOR EASY READING . Neptune Pine, £67.95, amazon.co.uk . If you don’t want to squint to see the screen, this smartwatch is the one for you. It has a mammoth 2.4 in face, making it about twice the size of most smartwatch screens and roughly half the size of an iPhone 4 screen. This high-resolution option doesn’t just make reading messages easier, it also means you get a full keyboard, which makes typing easier, too. The device pops out of its strap so you can take advantage of the two cameras. There’s one on the back and, for video calls or selfies, there’s a front-facing camera. Both have a flash. With GPS, pedometer and compass, it can also track your activity and calories burned. BEST FOR RETRO FANS . Withings Activité, £319.99, selfridges.com . Designed in Paris and made in Switzerland, this claims to combine cutting-edge technology with traditional European styling. With ticking hands protected by a scratch-proof glass and a French fine calf leather strap, it looks every inch an elegant, conventional timepiece. But underneath, clever sensors track your sleep patterns and monitor every step you take, communicating wirelessly with your phone. Wear it at night and it can act as the most discreet of alarm clocks via a silent vibration alert. Replaceable battery. BEST FOR FITNESS FANATICS . Basis Peak, £169, amazon.co.uk . Marketed as the ‘ultimate fitness and sleep tracker’, the Basis Peak incorporates what you’d expect of a fitness watch — water resistance, up to four days battery charge life and a movement sensor — but it has much more besides. It tracks your heart rate and has sensors for skin temperature and sweat levels. It can log sleep duration and quality, and communicates wirelessly with your mobile so you can see a full breakdown of how many calories you’ve burned. It adjusts weekly goals based on your performance. BEST PHONE-FREE SOLUTION . Samsung Gear S, £329, samsung.com . This is the watch that is so smart you can ditch your phone. It comes with a slot for a SIM card so it doesn’t need to piggy-back off another device and — like the Apple watch — has a choice of straps and a face that can be customised. Bluetooth connectivity means you can hook it up to a wireless headset with a microphone and make a phone call without having to shout into your wrist. You can listen to music — with 4GB of memory, there’s space for 1,000 songs. It also lets you browse maps and websites and the 2 in curved screen even has space for a tiny keyboard, though you can use voice commands instead. BEST FOR FAMILIARITY . Kairos T-Band HD, £165, kairoswatches.com . Many of us have watches that are treasured family heirlooms or expensive gifts that we don’t want to jettison just because new technology has rendered them obsolete. This clever invention means you can have the best of both worlds. Rather than being a smartwatch, it’s a smartstrap that can be ordered to fit almost any watch. It looks like a simple black band when it’s switched off, but when it’s activated, the LED panels embedded in it light up to display notifications, such as heart rate, alerts of incoming calls and messages.","Last week the Apple watch went on sale to British tech fanatics .

"Rail firms came under fire this weekend for planning a series of fare hikes of up to 87 per cent just ten days after the general election - despite the main party leaders pledging to freeze prices. The Prime Minister has requested First Great Western (FGW) 'urgently review' its decision to almost double some fares on the route between London and the Cotswolds - which passes through his Witney constituency. Mr Cameron has promised to freeze fares in real terms for the whole of the next parliament, while Labour has also pledged to bring in a 'cap' on price hikes. Scroll down for video . Sent letter: Prime Minister David Cameron has written to First Great Western to request it 'urgently reviews' plans to increase fares on trains running through his Witney constituency . Passengers travelling from Charlbury, the Oxfordshire station nearest to his constituency home, can currently purchase an off-peak return to London costing £33.30. This allows them to leave at 9.42am, outside the morning peak, but return on one of the four services that go from London during the evening peak period. But from May 17, these customers will be forced to pay £62.40 if they want to come home on one of these trains - an 87 per cent increase. The planned changes have angered Mr Cameron's constituents - prompting him to personally intervene. 1. First Great Western . Line: London to Hereford . Potential increase: 87% . 2. Virgin . Line: Stafford to Liverpool . Potential increase: 24.5% . 3. London Midlands . Line: Crewe to Northampton . Potential increase: 23% . The Prime Minister's spokesman told The Sunday Times: 'Mr Cameron has written to First Great Western and asked them to urgently review their decision.' Train companies have three windows every year in which they can increase 'unregulated' fares, which make up around half of their total revenue. Unregulated fares can include journeys such as off-peak leisure and advance-purchase tickets. First Great Western has insisted the reason for the change is to bring the north Cotswolds route in line with its other services. The firm is also offering some customers a cheaper option in advanced single tickets, potentially allowing them to buy a return for £20 if they book ahead. Other sharp price hikes to be introduced include an off-peak first-class single from Crewe to Northampton on London Midlands, which will rise from £30 to £37, according to trainsplit.com - a website that provides passengers with cheaper ticket options. The cost of an anytime return between Stafford and Liverpool, travelling with Virgin, will leap from £26.50 to £33 - a 24.5 per cent hike. Biggest hike: Passengers travelling with the rail firm between London and the Cotswolds could face increases of up to 87 per cent come May 17 . And an anytime first-class day return on Virgin from Manchester to Stoke will go up 22 per cent - rising from £29 to £35.30. Virgin has said the 'vast majority' of its price hikes affected 'Virgin Trains-only fares' - which are at least 20 per cent cheaper than tickets offered by rival firms. It added: 'Our overall fare increase this year on the west coast is just 1.65 per cent, well below the industry average.' Speaking to Mark Hookham of The Sunday Times, Mike Richardson, of trainsplit.com, said: 'Passengers might very well be surprised at these fare increases when both the main parties have talked about price freeezes. According to Which? Hundreds of 'anytime' and 'off-peak' returns rose by 40 per cent in January. Its research found rail fare increases on tickets that passengers buy on the day and on rural routes. Defended rise: Virgin has said the 'vast majority' of its price hikes affected 'Virgin Trains-only fares' - which are at least 20 per cent cheaper than tickets offered by rival firms .","PM has written to First Great Western asking for 'urgent review' of fare hike .

"As the bright, smiling face of morning TV in the Noughties Fern Britton shocked fans when she admitted to struggling with crippling depression. The mother-of-four had her first experience of depression as a child and has suffered attacks throughout her adult life. Things were so difficult at one point that she planned to crash her car into a brick wall. And in an interview with The Telegraph on Saturday the 57-year-old revealed how close she came to suicide one day after her divorce from first husband Clive Jones. Scroll down for video . Presenter Fern Britton, who suffers from depression, has revealed how close she came to suicide following her divorce from first husband Clive Jones . The presenter and author, who has been married to her second husband TV chef Phil Vickery, 53, for fifteen years, claims she knew the marriage was never right, but remembers the time after the divorce being particularly bleak. Fern, who had three children with  Clive, twins Harry and Jack, 21, and Grace, 18, and has another daughter, Winifred, 13, with Phil, said: 'I remember very clearly, when they were all little and sitting around the table, all shiny-faced and having their supper, and I'd think: ""Right, you've got everything you want. Lovely! Now I'm just going to pop upstairs and kill myself."" ' Meeting Phil whilst working on Ready, Steady, Cook was something of a salvation for the blonde, who finally came off anti-depressants last year but admits she is fully expecting to go back on them when she has another episode. Fern and husband Phil Vickery will celebrate their 15th wedding anniversary next month . The couple met on the TV food show Ready, Steady, Cook . At least now she has learned to recognise the signs, telling Good Housekeeping this month: 'I haven’t had an episode for a long time. I’m cross that it’s been there and that it lurks around, but I’ve started to understand it more. I reached a stage where I knew when it was coming, hurtling towards me, and I thought, don’t run away, just stand there, brace yourself, and let it happen. Because I knew it would pass. People who are going through their first or second episode don’t trust that it will pass – but it really will.' Today, as she promotes her sixth novel 'A Good Catch' Fern is happy, positive and looking forward to a bright - and Botox-free - future. Phil, 53, and Fern, 57, have four children between them . The author has declared that she has no interest in cosmetic surgery, deciding instead to grow older gracefully . She has declared that she has no interest in cosmetic surgery, deciding instead to grow older gracefully, telling Bryony Gordon: 'I know I'm never going to look the way I did when I was 25, but I know I could look very odd. So this is what 57 is, and this is what 57 looks like. 'I'm going to stop looking back and only look forward. I've got. what, 25 years left? I'm going to enjoy them. I'm going to cycle until I am 70. I'm not going to get Botox or have things done. I'm going to show my children that this is what humans do: we get older.' The keen cyclist, who starts a three-week cycle from John O'Groats to Land's End to raise money for Genesis Research Trust next week, insists that being fit is more important to her than looking younger, saying: 'My bosoms are dropping? Blah, that's life! I am vain about being as fit as I can be – not about my wrinkles. I’ve had that conversation with myself about, should I do Botox, should I do this, should I do that – and I’ve talked myself out of it. I’d prefer to be the woman I should be.
