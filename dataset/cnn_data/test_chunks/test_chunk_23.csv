"Just like humans learning to talk, puppies can sometimes take a while to learn to bark. At least, that seemed to be the case for one young Shibu Inu, who caused hilarity with a somewhat chatty display at an American Kennel Club centre. The pup was filmed squeaking and squawking after meeting a young husky dog and attempting to bark at its new companion. Captured on video, the puppies are held in the air by their respective handlers and one of the dogs makes a high-pitched whining sound. Opening its mouth, the Shibu Inu then begins vocalising with a yappy bark before the husky – leaning back in its handler’s arm – whines. People standing by laugh and put their hands to their mouths as a staff member turns to address and pacify the dog. The puppy Shibu Inu and husky feature opposite one another while conversing at an American Kennel Club centre . Falling quiet for a second, the Shibu Inu pipes up once more – louder than before – causing the husky to respond. As the dogs continue to converse, the video maker asks with a giggle: ‘What is that noise?’ But it is barely audible over the sounds of the intense barking, whining and yapping. Later in the video the excited Shibu Inu begins running in its owner's arms in its attempts to get closer to the husky. Passers-by laugh and film the two dogs as they begin yapping, whining and barking at one another . And people in the video can be seen laughing while mimicking the dog’s erratic and entirely humorous actions. The video concludes with the husky losing interest slightly and chewing on its handler’s sleeve. Before the same handler speaks to the Shibu Inu and gives it a rub, causing it to momentarily settle down. A staff member from the American Kennel Club centre attempts to pacify the puppy by giving it a rub . Canine vocalisation usually begins when a puppy is around two-to-three-weeks-old and generally consists of grunts and whines. At seven-to-eight-weeks-old, the vocalisation will develop into stronger sounding barks, although some dogs wait as long as 16 weeks before even making an attempt.","The Shibu Inu puppy has the impromptu chat with a husky .

"Selfie sticks and extreme sports are not designed to go together, as a snowboarder in Japan proved. While enjoying the slopes in the country’s Chiisagata District, the man can be seen decked out in purple holding a matching selfie stick at arm’s length. Recording himself from behind, the man begins his descent of the mountain and a skier can be seen just in front of him. Weaving down the slope, the snowboarder initially appears to make a success of the video and he even causes the snow to spray in the air while turning. Picking up the speed, the man heads in the direction of the chairlifts before moving away again – adjusting his selfie stick to capture himself from the front in the process. But as the confident snowboarder adjusts the camera, he is oblivious to the chairlift swinging into view behind. The snowboarder, in a bright purple jacket, is using a selfie stick to film himself in action . The show-off stops to clear some snow off the screen of the camera, not realising what is about to happen . It is later explained online that there was too much snow and that the chairlift was therefore lower to the ground than it would normally be. As the snowboarder in the purple jacket turns to his companion and appears to talk, the empty chairlift deals him a heavy blow to the head. And the final indignity sees the boarder fall to the ground while still filming himself. The snowboarder can be heard making a scream as he holds the back of his head and falls to the floor. Realising his mistake, the snowboarder concludes the video by shuffling himself out of the way and sitting beside the chairlift as another passes safely by. The empty chairlift appears out of nowhere and clatters the snowboarder over the head . And the final indignity sees the snowboarder fall to the ground while still filming himself .","The man records himself descending mountain with fellow skier .

"A group of daring drift trike riders have captured some amaznig footage as they zipped down the world’s steepest residential road on tricycles. Harley Jolly, Tyson Barr and Nic Roy – known collectively as Slide Christchurch – videoed themselves descending New Zealand's Dunedin’s Baldwin Street on three-wheeled vehicles known as 'slide trikes'.

"This is the moment a college athlete's victory turned to ashes in his hands after he slowed down to celebrate his win and got overtaken. Tanguy Pepiot, a steeplechase runner for the University of Oregon, had a clear lead on his rival Meron Simon, who competes for the University of Washington. But at a track meet Saturday in Eugene, Oregon, a crowd of more than 3,000 people saw the distance evaporate after Pepiot raised his hands in pre-emptive joy, with less than 100m to go. Tanguy Pepiot celebrated his victory (left) before missing out to his rival on the finishing line (right) Pepiot (right) is pictured raising his hands to excite the crowd - as Meron Simon (left) tears toward him . The gesture seemed to sap some of his momentum, opening the way for Simon to speed towards the finish line, and beat him by a tenth of a second. The home crowd roared as Simon powered ahead - seemingly in an attempt to warn French-born Pepiot. But the warning came too late, and Simon flashed past, leaving Pepiot, who is in his senior year, to collapse, defeated. Simon's time, 8:57.86, exceeded his personal record by around 15 seconds. Speaking to the Eugene Register-Guard after the contest, a newly-victorious Simon said: 'I thought he had me. Simon edges past Meriot as the pair approach the line, eventually beating him by a tenth of a second . After celebrating his triumph, Simon headed back to help Pepiot up after he collapsed to the ground in defeat . 'I thought he was just so far ahead. Then I heard the crowd get crazy, and he started throwing his hands up. 'I was like, ""I don’t think he knows I’m coming"". I just went to the line and just raced.' After a justified victory celebration of his own, Simon doubled back to console his close rival. Not long after, a defeated Pepiot told columnist Austin Meek: 'I think it was the first time it happened to me. I'll make sure it's the last time.' Meron (left) ran his best ever time in the 3,000m steeplechase, while Pepiot has pledged not to get cocky again .","University of Oregon's Tanguy Pepiot had strong lead over Meron Simon .

"Top marks for Saskia, the girlfriend of an Arsenal fan who aced a written exam on all things Gunners to save their relationship and whose mostly correct responses have gone viral. Saskia, 17, whose username is @saskiaisabxlla, posted excerpts of the exam on Monday with the message ‘Boyfriend made me take an @Arsenal exam.’ For Saskia (surname withheld), the stakes were high before she scored 43.5 out of a possible 50 points, or 87 per cent. By the grading system of her boyfriend, who didn’t want to be identified, that constitutes an A. Saskia, 17, aced the 'Arsenal exam' given by her boyfriend with a score of 43.5 out of 50 or 87 per cent . ‘Well done, Saskia. As a result, I will not be dumping you [lucky you],’ he wrote in red pen on the cover of the test along with some feedback. The post has since been retweeted 9,600 times, almost five times for each of her 1,900 or so followers, with widespread congratulations coming from Gunners fans. ‘Could have performed better in Q17,’ a question in which she was asked to explain ‘why Alexis Sanchez is better than Eden Hazard.’ Her responses included ‘Sanchez is buff’ and that ‘he scores a lot of goals’. A derogatory comment about Hazard, the newly crowned PFA Player of the Year, got extra marks. She told Sportsmail: 'After the Arsenal vs Chelsea game the previous Sunday, he told me ""I might make make an Arsenal exam for you"". At first I thought he was joking but then I thought it would be funny to do it. 'Over the time that we have been together I managed to adopt his interest and learnt a lot about football in the process. So the following day I took it under his watch to make sure I didn't cheat. He marked it based on his own grade boundaries and I did better than he expected. 'I tweeted it the same evening, but we never expected it to get this far. I've had mixed reception but most of it was positive, some even calling him a ""legend"". He said that our relationship was on the line but he was bluffing and used it as a tool to motivate me. 'A few took it too seriously but at the end of the day it was just something that we did together for fun and was meant to be humorous and lighthearted.' Saskia correctly identified the Arsenal away strip although she didn't recall the score of the 2014 FA Cup final . Club loyalty was an important part of the exam and Saskia knew  the score when it came to Sanchez v Hazard . Saskia’s recall of last year’s FA Cup final was also tested, but she mustn’t have been paying attention that day when the Gunners beat Hull 3-2 (not 2-0) and Aaron Ramsey scored the winner (not Olivier Giroud). After correctly identifying a yellow Gunners shirt as the away strip, Saskia was asked to name the entire Arsenal starting XI with their positions for 22 points. She faltered only in calling Mesut Ozil a defender, Danny Welbeck a midfielder instead of a striker (harsh marking) and leaving out Laurent Koscielny altogether. Alexis Sanchez 'is buff,' says Saskia in one answer; although she thought Mesut Ozil was a defender . In her boyfriend’s feedback he advised Saskia to ‘Learn all player positions’ and how she is supposed to feel about North London rivals Tottenham. ‘I salute your boyfriend! And you deserve a medal for being such a sport!’ tweeted Sajan Gupta (‏@Maverick_3).","Twitter user Saskia, 17, posted 'Arsenal exam' result on social media .

A woman in China showed her strength by using her legs to lift a group of people. The footage captured at a birthday party in Sichuan Province shows a woman lying on her back on a stage. Placed across her outstretched legs is a plank of wood and clinging to either side of it are two women who are about to become human weights. The woman holds two people on a plank of wood and starts lifting them up and down with her legs . Three men stand and assist the women before stepping back and preparing to enjoy the show. Suddenly music begins playing and the woman starts pumping her legs up and down as the two volunteers struggle to hold on. The woman shows amazing strength by remaining in the position for some time before she begins twirling the plank of wood – removing a leg in between rotations.

"It's crunch time this weekend at the top of the Premier League as second-placed Arsenal host table toppers Chelsea - and it appears one star of the former's team cannot wait for the ever-nearing kick-off. Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil can now countdown the minutes until the 4pm encounter on Sunday with his brand new Apple Watch. The 26-year-old was the beneficiary of the timepiece - which ranges in price from £299 to £13,500 - as he visited an Apple store on Thursday afternoon. Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil (right) took to Instagram to show off his new Apple Watch on Thursday . Ozil compared his watch to TV character Michael Knight in the hit action show Knight Rider . Ozil took to Instagram to share his joy at his latest gift, comparing his gadget to former TV character Michael Knight from the hit action show Knight Rider. Accompanied with the caption: 'Excited about my new cool gadget!

The midfielder, who has scored four goals in 25 matches for the Gunners in all competitions this season, is expected to start for Arsene Wenger's side at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Arsenal trail the Blues by 10 points with six league games remaining - but have been boosted by the return of Jack Wilshere. Wilshere was on the bench in their FA Cup semi-final win over Reading at Wembley on April 18 after five months out through injury. And club legend Ray Parlour believes that the 23-year-old’s fitness record is the one thing holding him back from reaching his undoubted potential in the Arsenal midfield. ‘I think he’s the future of the club,’ said Parlour. ‘I think if he stays fit, he’s a quality player, there’s no doubt about that.

Look at Abou Diaby. Diaby’s a terrific player. But look at him, the injuries the last few years. ‘The big burning question is can Wilshere have a full season without being injured for a long period, like he hasn’t had for the last three or four seasons.’ Wilshere, the England international, is pictured in training for Arsenal at London Colney last week .","Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil was given an Apple Watch on Thursday .

"Chris Smalling has signed a three-year contract extension at Manchester United worth in the region of £80,000-a-week after turning his career around at Old Trafford. The 25-year-old England centre-back had been linked with a move to Arsenal after struggling to hold down a first-team place at United and being branded ‘stupid’ by manager Louis van Gaal for his sending-off in the Manchester derby at the Etihad earlier this season. Smalling was also guilty of several off-the-field indiscretions, including being pictured going to a fancy-dress party as a suicide bomber last year. Chris Smalling (left) signs his new Manchester United contract alongside club boss Louis van Gaal . Smalling celebrates scoring United's fourth goal during their 4-2 Premier League win against Manchester City . But the defender has matured under Van Gaal and become a regular starter in the Dutchman’s team this season. He was due to be out of contract next summer but has now committed himself to United until 2019. Van Gaal said: ‘I am delighted he has signed a new contract. Chris has improved and developed immensely during the short time that I have been at the club and has become an integral part of the first-team squad. ‘He always conducts himself in a very professional manner and it is also pleasing that he has scored some important goals this season too.’ Smalling, who cost United £10million from Fulham in 2010, has made 147 appearances and won two Premier League titles. Four of his nine goals for the club have come this season, including one in the Old Trafford derby earlier this month as United beat City 4-2. The 25-year-old has become a regular for Van Gaal after struggling for a first time place earlier this season . He said: ‘I am so proud to play for such a great club. We have developed as a team over the course of the season under Louis van Gaal and we are now playing as a complete unit. ‘This is a very exciting time to be at Manchester United. We are all determined to get back to where we belong and competing at the highest level.’ Smalling has established himself as a permanent member of England's squad during the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign and that boils down to his vast improvement under Van Gaal. Smalling shakes hands with Dutch boss Van Gaal after signing his new long-term deal . Smalling has made 147 appearances for United and won two Premier League titles along the way . With a top four finish and Champions League qualification close to being secured, the 25-year-old can look forward to more European adventures as his development continues. After the disappointment of last season, Van Gaal has instilled a level of confidence into his players and Smalling has thrived under his tenure since the turn of the year. The former Fulham man is keeping big summer signing Marcos Rojo out of the side at and that's testament to his improvements after a difficult start to the season. Smalling is expected to keep his place in United's starting eleven for the visit to Everton, as the Red Devils look to get back to winning ways after defeat at Chelsea.

"Pele and Franz Beckenbauer were reunited on Friday to light up the Empire State Building in New York Cosmos green ahead of the start of the new season. As has become tradition, the top of the iconic building in New York has turned green for the weekend to celebrate the start of Cosmos' North American Soccer League season, and the occasion was marked by two very special guests. Beckenbauer and Pele are two of the greatest footballers ever to have lived, and the pair played for New York Cosmos together in the late 1970s. As the former noted, they were pioneers at the time, bringing football to a territory that had rarely seen the game before. Franz Beckenbauer (left) and Pele (centre) were reunited in New York on Friday afternoon . The pair played for New York Cosmos in the 1970s, before the club went bankrupt in the following years . Speaking at the ceremony on Friday, Beckenbauer joked to Pele: 'Your English is better than 30 or 40 years ago when we played together. 'I told you once you were one of the reasons I signed for the New York Cosmos in the year of 1977. Pele, he came in 1975, and I think we were pioneers at the time because no-one here in the country played soccer.' Brazilian legend Pele, now 74, also had his say as the pair flicked the switch to turn on the lights. Pele (right) runs with the ball, while team-mate Beckenbauer watches on in the background . Ahead of the new season starting this weekend, the pair turned the Empire State Building green to celebrate . Pele and Beckenbauer joined hands at the top, and spoke of their pride at returning to New York . 'I thank God for this moment, for this help. And Beckenbauer, now my partner, is going to suffer together because the New York Cosmos come back but now we just stay on the bench. Congratulations, good luck to you.' Following success with Pele and Beckenbauer in the 70s, Cosmos went bankrupt and stopped playing in the 1980s, only returning in 2010 with Pele as the club's honorary president. They play in the second division of American soccer, kicking off their season with a match against Tampa Bay Rowdies on Saturday. Pele was asked whether he'd prefer Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, and the Brazil legend chose Messi . Pele, regularly voted the best player of all time, says Ronaldo is 'more forward, more of a scorer' When lists of the greatest ever footballers are released, both Beckenbauer and Pele are familiar sights in the top 10. Nowadays, Messi v Ronaldo is the popular debate, and the Brazilian legend has had his say on modern football's messiahs. 'It's not that I like one of Messi or Cristiano more, when people ask me, I always say that you cannot compare them,' he told Al Primer Toque. 'Cristiano is a great player, more forward, more of a scorer. Messi is a player who makes goals but also creates chances as a weapon in behind. 'The two would be very important, but if I had to choose one it would be Messi.'","New York Cosmos will begin their North American Soccer League season this weekend with a match against Tampa Bay Rowdies .

"With house prices soaring, it's not easy finding somewhere to live. And this community has thrown in the towel. Meet Seattle's rolling neighborhood of RVs, where each unassuming vehicle is a capsule home. The unusual format has been captured in a series of photographs by visual journalist Anna Erickson. Meet Bud Dodson, 57, and welcome to his home: An RV in Seattle's SoDo where he watches over the parking lot in exchange for a spot . No place like home: John Warden, 52, has turned his $200 vehicle into his home after his apartment burned down years ago . There are around 30 drivers that float in and out of this parking lot in the SoDo (South of Downtown) area of the city in Washington State. One might not notice them in the mornings as hundreds of workers in the nearby factories, such as Starbucks, park up and rush into work. But on the weekends, as the rabble flocks back to their beds, this unique group remains. John Worden, 52, has been living in his vehicle for years since his apartment burned down and he was left homeless. He told Anna his car cost $200, and doesn't drive very well. But for a home, it's just about enough. Though plan on the outside, it is a Pandora's Box inside, Anna tells DailyMail.com. 'It was scattered with trinkets that he had been collecting over the years,' she explained, 'and a pile of beer cans that he was saving to turn in for money.' For work, he panhandles while helping people find parking spaces at Safeco Field stadium, where he used to be a cook. People come and go for work in the factories nearby, but on the weekend it is just the RV-dwellers that area left . Daily life: Here Bud can be seen preparing himself a barbecue on the gravel outside his capsule home, one of about 30 in the community . Eclectic: While Bud's RV is organized and functional, John's is full of trinkets and belongings dating back years . Alongside him - most of the time - is Bud Dodson, 57. While some are forced to move about regularly, Dodson, a maintenance man, looks after the parking lot in exchange for a semi-permanent spot. His home has its own unique stamp on it. 'He had really made the RV his home and taken good care of it,' Anna described. 'It was more functional [than John's] and a cleaner space with a bed, kitchen and bathroom.' Whether organized or eclectic, however, each one is home. 'None of them seem to want to move on,' Anna said. 'It's not perfect but they seem pretty content. Move in, move out: Some have agreements to stay, but others have to keep driving around to find a spot . John works as a panhandler at Safeco Fields stadium, where he used to work as a cook . He is content with his life in between the usual confines of society . Personal: To many this may just seem like a parking lot but for these men it is a very personal space . 'Bud is very grateful, he said the parking lot owner is just such a nice guy to let him live like this.' She came across them when she stopped to ask a seemingly homeless man for directions. 'We got talking,' she said, 'and he mentioned that he lived nearby in an RV. I went round to look and there was a whole bunch of them.' Curious, she spent about two months returning to the spot, meeting with the community and building their trust. 'These RVs are their homes so it's a very personal thing,' she explained.","Around 30 people live a floating life in Seattle's SoDo (South of Downtown) area in their RVs .

"A flaw in robots designed to perform surgery has been found that lets them be easily hacked, according to researchers. The experts were able to take control of a so-called telerobot during surgery by exploiting a simple programming trick. This enabled them to change the speed of the arms of the robot and change their orientation, making it impossible for the machines to carry out a procedure as directed. Researchers at the University of Washington studied the telerobot Raven II (shown). They found that robots designed for surgery could be 'easily' hacked in to. This is because they are operated over public networks which allowed the researchers to access them and stop them working . The research was carried out by scientists at the University of Washington by toying with a product from their own university - the Raven II teleoperated robotical surgeon. Teleoperation means an operator can use the robot remotely, through a control console. The first telesurgery took place in 2001 with a surgeon in New York successfully removing the gall bladder of a patient in France, more than 3,730 miles (6,000km) away. The communications ran over a dedicated fiber provided by a telecommunications company. But this is an expensive option since such fibers can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Since then, surgeons have carried out remote operations and begun to experiment with ordinary communications links over the web, which are significantly cheaper. Although there are no recorded incidents in which the communications infrastructure has caused problems during a telesurgery operation, there are still questions over security and privacy, said the experts. Source: MIT Technology Review . In the case of Raven II, a remote operator users two long and thin arms to perform complex procedures where otherwise their hands might not be capable. While this experiment was performed in a controlled environment and not on the operating table, the researchers said it's clear more stringent security measures are needed. Raven II runs on a single PC, and communicates with a control console using a standard communications protocol known as Interoperable Telesurgery Protocol. But rather than take place over a secure private network, this takes place over public networks. ‘Due to the open and uncontrollable nature of communication networks, it becomes easy for malicious entities to jam, disrupt, or take over the communication between a robot and a surgeon,’ said the researchers. In their test, the experts performed various types of cyberattack to see how easily it could be disrupted. This included changing the commands sent by an operator to the robot, modifying signals or hijacking - completely taking over - the robot. And they were also able to ‘easily stop the robot from ever being properly reset, thus effectively making a surgical procedure impossible.’ While this experiment was performed in a controlled environment and not on the operating table (stock image pictured), the researchers said it is clear more stringent security measures are needed . During the experiment, an operator was asked to move blocks onto different pegs (shown) with the robot, but when the 'hackers' took control, the task proved difficult - or impossible . The researchers note that while their test applies only to Raven II, other surgical robots that use similar teleoperation were likely also at risk. ‘Some of these attacks could have easily been prevented by using well-established and readily-available security mechanisms, including encryption and authentication,’ the researchers note. We believe that presented concerns are not unique to teleoperated surgery, but are common to all teleoperated robots. ‘Because of the wide variety of physical and digital capabilities these systems wield, telerobotic security needs to become front-and-centre.’ The findings are published in the paper: To Make a Robot Secure: An Experimental Analysis of Cyber Security Threats Against Teleoperated Surgical Robots on arXiv.","Researchers at the University of Washington studied so-called telerobots .

"REJECTION PROOF . by Jia Jiang . (Random House, £13.99) Who likes rejection? Whether you are being rejected by a lover, an employer or a barman who serves a newly arrived regular customer before you, it’s galling. And in every case there’s nothing we can do about it. Nothing that doesn’t carry a long prison sentence, anyway. It would take someone exceptionally optimistic and uncynical to propose an alternative thesis, and Jia Jiang is both of those. Born into a family of teachers, Jia Jiang was so determined to become an entrepreneur that, as a child in China, he dug a hole in the garden, intending to reach America by the shortest route. He eventually made the journey by conventional means, and found a good life there. Wife, children, several degrees, job in middle management. But he wasn’t happy. He wanted to take risks, start his own company. It doesn't matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected and in each and every case there’s nothing we can do about it (picture posed by model) The problem was he inevitably encountered rejection, mainly from potential backers for his project (another iPhone app no one could possibly need or want). And each time, rejection felt like the end of the world. A successful entrepreneur needed to be more robust than this. So, having possibly read one self-help book too many, Jia Jiang decided to embark on his own rejection-proofing quest. Instead of avoiding rejection, he would spend 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected, film them and put them up on his blog. All of which seemed to me, at first glance, rather artificial. There have been any number of ‘quest’ books, in which humorous writers have gone round Ireland with a fridge, for example, less for the sake of doing it than to write a book about it. But Jia Jiang isn’t a humorous writer. He may adopt a light-hearted tone, but his quest was deadly serious. On day one, he went up to a security guard and asked if he could borrow $100. The security guard said no, and Jia almost broke into a run to get away. Watching the video later, he said he looked like the man in Munch’s The Scream. On day two, he went into a burger joint and, noticing a sign on the soft drinks machine saying ‘Free refill’, asked the cashier for a burger refill. The cashier said no. But as he continued his quest, Jia realised there were ways and ways of asking. Show confidence, inject a little bit of humour, be willing to negotiate and you might not get exactly what you want, but you might get something. So he walked into Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and asked for a set of five iced doughnuts, interlocking in the manner of the Olympic symbol. The woman behind the counter looked thoughtful. ‘When are you looking for these?’ she asked. ‘In the next . . . 15 minutes?’ ‘Let me see what I can do,’ she said. And did it. You can see what happened next on YouTube. And so develops a surprisingly entertaining study of rejection in all its many manifestations. People confuse it with failure, but rejection is personal, and we take it personally. The crucial point is that rejection is unavoidable and it’s how we respond to it that matters. Jia Jiang’s extreme positivity can grate at times but his message is sound: rejection is only someone else’s opinion, and it may not be the right one.","It doesn't matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected .

The interior of a manual version of the Audi soft-top can be seen here . BAD .","We've enjoyed some of the highest temperatures of the year this week .
The range starts at £31,995 and the Audi can cost as much as £50,000 .
No matter how good, the new Audi TT still has nothing on the 1999 model .
With the sunshine beaming this week and some of the highest temperatures recorded so far this year, what better moment to splash out on the new third-generation Audi TT Roadster. It goes on sale this month. Just the time to get the roof off on this softtop German sports car, which has established itself as a firm favourite in the 16 years it has been on the road.
I drove the fully stocked four-wheel-drive 2-litre TFSI in S-line quattro trim with 230 bhp, which was adept at whipping around the Cotswolds in style.
Sure-footed and fun to drive with lively acceleration that takes it from rest to 62 mph in just 6.1 seconds up to a top speed electronically limited to 155 mph. CO2 emissions are a fair 154g/km.
Supportively cossetting sports seats leave you sitting comfortably at the wheel.
A nicely tuned exhaust pipe gives the TT Roadster a most satisfying 'brrrm brrrm'.
You won't break the bank at the filling station. Even with the satisfying performance you'll average 43.5mpg, rising to 52.3mpg when cruising and still managing a respectable 33.6 mpg around town.
Great wind-in-the-hair motoring with a top that will come down in ten seconds at speeds of up to 31mph, and a more streamlined body.
It's easy to make a hands-free phone call with the automatic three-layer fabric hood down because microphones are embedded in the safety belt.
Auto-dim LED headlights have been transferred across from the flagship Audi A8 saloon.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Though this version is on an allnew platform, the progression is evolution, not revolution.
The car I drove cost well in excess of £50,000. The range starts from £31,995 for the 2-litre TDi Sport in six-speed manual.
The optional open-top driving package includes head-level heating to keep your bonce from getting chilly, an electrically operated wind deflector, which stops parky draughts whistling behind your neck, and handily heated super sports seats.
No matter how good, nothing will have the jaw-dropping impact on the car market as the original Audi TT of 1999. It was dubbed the 'Bauhaus Bullet' because of its clean, minimalist lines reminiscent of the German art movement of the Twenties and early Thirties.
Hefty prestige price tag. The base price of the car I drove was £41,630. But it was loaded up with extras adding another £13,000 — or the price of a half-decent family runaround.
These include an open-top driving package (£1,000), rotorgrey fine Nappa leather and super-sports seats (£1,390), a comfort and sound package (£1,590), technology package (£1,795), electric front seats (£995), 19 in twin-spoke alloy wheels (£450), metallic paint (£545), and LED headlights (£945)."
"A Canadian tourist who was involved in the death of a Chinese woman at the Great Wall of China has agreed to pay more than £60,000 in compensation to the victim’s family. Cui Hongfang, 73, died in front of horrified family members and holidaymakers after she was knocked over by the 38-year-old Canadian woman. Mrs Hongfang, from Heilongjiang Province in north-eastern China, struck her head in a tragedy that was ruled an accident by police. This photo of Cui Hongfang, 73, was taken shortly before she died at the Great Wall of China . Mrs Hongfang's husband said she fell down the stairs after she was knocked over by a Canadian tourist . The victim’s husband told Chinese media that the tourist was rushing down a steep set of steps on the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall when she bumped into his wife. Mrs Hongfang fell down the steps and died shortly after she struck her head and lost consciousness. Her husband said: ‘The foreigner was moving really fast. She was chasing [someone] and laughing and wanted to go between me and my wife.’ The victim’s family filed a civil lawsuit against the tourist, identified by Chinese media as Debra Fortin, and demanded she be prevented from leaving China after police announced that they would not be laying any criminal charges stemming from the April 8 incident.

Police interviewed the tourist, identified by Chinese media as Debra Fortin, and ruled the death an accident . Relatives even went as far as visiting the hotel where the Canadian was staying and attempting to stop her from returning to Canada, Shanghaiist reported. After two days of pre-trial mediation at a court in Beijing the two sides have agreed on a compensation amount of 600,000 yuan (approximately £63,000 or USD$96,000), to be delivered in 15 days, The Beijing News and Shanghai Daily reported.

"If Wigan Athletic are to be relegated from the Sky Bet Championship, then their new manager Gary Caldwell would want to see them go down kicking and screaming. Martyn Waghorn took that a little too literally against Millwall, his red card for a senseless kick at Dan Harding punished by a Lions side determined to avoid a similar fate. When Waghorn, who played for Millwall on loan from Leicester in 2013, lashed out after failing to win a corner on the hour, it was set up for the hosts to claim three precious points. And they were duly delivered when Jimmy Abdou headed home Harding’s cross with 15 minutes remaining, sending a febrile Den into raptures. Millwall team-mates rush to congratulate substitute Magaye Gueye after he scored their second goal . Lions No 1 David Forde celebrates after Jimmy Abdou came on to break the deadlock with a rare strike . Martyn Waghorn was one of three players sent off - two for Wigan and one for Millwall in the fiesty clash . Millwall: Forde (c); Cummings, Nelson, Beevers, Harding; Upson, Abdou, Williams (Bailey 42), Martin (Gueye 68); O’Brien (Woolford 84), Gregory . Substitutes not used: Archer (GK); Cowan-Hall, Fuller, Taylor-Fletcher . Scorers: Abdou 75; Gueye 90+3 . Booked: Gregory, Martin, Bailey, Beevers . Sent off: Upson . Wigan Athletic: Carson; Boyce, Maguire, Pearce, Bong; Pennant (Chow 81), Perch (c), Kvist (Ojo 90+1), Kim Bo-Kyung, McLean; Fortune (Waghorn 53) Substitutes not used: Al Habsi (GK); McCann, Barnett, Murphy . Booked: Bong, Bo-Kyung . Sent off: Waghorn, Pearson . Referee: Stephen Martin (Staffordshire) In his six seasons at the club, that was only Abdou’s seventh goal. What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn’t a misprint. There was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O’Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall’s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction. The game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm. And a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson. Millwall’s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night. The plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points. Harris had described this match as a ‘Cup Final’ and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell’s men. Wigan's former Arsenal and Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant (left) takes on Dan Harding of Millwall . Millwall's Aiden O'Brien (left) competes with Emmerson Boyce of Wigan during the relegation six-pointer . The Lions manager proudly declared afterwards: ‘That was a Millwall performance, that’s what this club is all about. If the players haven’t learned anything from me before tonight, they certainly have now. ‘I don’t necessarily condone challenges and melees but if you need a spark at The Den, then you have to take care of your own.’ And he couldn’t resist a joke at the expense of Abdou’s scoring record after his first goal in two years. ‘Jimmy Abdou is a great fellow, a great servant to Millwall FC,’ he said. ‘If anyone deserved that goal for his performances since I took over. He has the ability to do that and I’ve been telling him for seven years he can do that. ‘He’s got the ability in the legs, I think his last goal was in training about three and a half years ago!’ With Wigan seven points from safety, Millwall’s approach left manager Gary Caldwell irritated. He said: ‘There was one team out there trying to play football and another trying to rough us up. ‘The game got out of hand second-half, we needed a strong ref in a stadium like this.’ Wigan’s James McClean rattled the outside of the post with a cross-cum-shot that almost caught goalkeeper David Forde out after five minutes, while at the other end, Scott Carson had to race off his line to thwart Aiden O’Brien when he broke clear. But overall the first-half was a poor spectacle, enlivened only by the handbags that engaged the crowd. Wigan's James Perch (right) goes up for a header with Millwall midfielder Shaun Williams . Wigan manager Gary Caldwell looks on nervously as his hopes of survival are dented . Within the first five minutes of the second-half, Millwall created more than their sum total in the first. Former England stopper Carson had to be at his athletic best to turn away an O’Brien shot that seemed destined for the top corner. And when thew red mist descended on Waghorn, there was only one winner. It coincided with Millwall’s best spell in the game and they capitalised when Abdou produced his potentially season-defining header. After Gueye made sure at the end, chants of ‘Super Neil Harris’ echoed around the ground. Is another heroic act from this club legend on the cards?","Millwall won their relegation six-pointer with 2-0 victory over Wigan .

"Benik Afobe’s first-half finish kept Wolves slim dreams of promotion alive and helped push 10-man Wigan to the brink of relegation after a tense clash at the DW Stadium. Afobe popped up unmarked early on to bundle home and the result leaves Wigan on the verge of dropping into English football’s third-tier after a dreadful season. To make matters worse, the Latics will have to face Brentford next weekend without star man James McClean who received his marching orders in injury-time for a second bookable offence. Wolverhampton's Benik Afobe (right) celebrates scoring the winner in a 1-0 defeat of Wigan . The Latics had James McClean sent off for a second bookable offence in jury time . Wigan Athletic: Carson; Pearce, Perch, Maguire; Boyce, Chow (Cowie 79), Kvist (Fortune 56), Bong, Bo-kyung; McClean, Pennant (McKay 68) Subs not used: Al Habsi, Taylor, McCann, Cowie, Barnett .

Booked: Iorfa, Stearman and Dicko . Scorer: Afobe 25 . Referee: J Linington . Attendance: 16,810 . The Latics now have to hope Rotherham fail against Reading on Tuesday and Leeds United next weekend while they win at Griffin Park on the last day of the season. Wigan’s dire position represents a spectacular downfall for the north-west club who lifted the FA Cup just 712 days ago and who spent eight entertaining years in the Premier League between 2005 and 2013. They once seemed to brilliantly punch above their weight in England’s top-flight but they have slipped into despair after using three managers and 42 players across this season. And, worryingly enough for their fans, if they do go down an uncomfortable summer involving an expected player exodus will almost certainly be on the cards. Yet this clash was not all about the home side as Afobe also ensured that Wolves fans can still dream of a Wembley ending to this season – but only just. The stakes for both sides in this clash could hardly have been higher as Kenny Jackett’s visitors needed three points to keep up their late scramble for a play-off spot although that now looks unlikely as they would need three points and a huge goal swing on the last day to make it into the top six. Afobe races past Wigan's Gaetan Bong as the visitors kept their hopes of promotion alive . Wigan defender Emmerson Boyce drops to his knees as the former FA Cup winners head towards the drop . Gary Caldwell, the former Wigan captain parachuted into the managerial hotseat following Malky Mackay’s sacking earlier this month, again called for the club’s fans to meet and greet his squad at the players’ carpark before the match to let them know how much survival meant. A healthy handful did just that but their pleas fell on deaf ears in a clash that just about summed up Wigan’s entire season. They home side dominated the opening moments and looked up for the challenge of beating the odds – and the drop – and McClean should have scored when he swivelled and shot from close range after seven minutes. Caldwell’s influence on Wigan has been immediate and they are playing far better football than witnessed earlier this year under either Uwe Rosler or Mackay. But killer instinct is in short supply – and it showed. Former Stoke star Jermaine Pennant was the next to test Wolves defence as his deflected effort only just went over the bar after 12 minutes but the home side were then undone shortly after with the kind of goal that underlines the chronic defensive frailties that have so affected this term. A Bakary Sako free-kick from the edge of the box was brilliantly met by Afobe who could not miss from three yards out as Wigan’s defence stood and watched. As news filtered around the DW Stadium that Derby were losing at Millwall, and that Wolves were just a point outside the top-six as a consequence, Jackett’s side looked to press home their advantage against a Wigan side that played attractively without any real penetration. However, neither side created any real clear-cut chances and both goalkeepers spent the remainder of the first half as spectators. After the break, Wigan again began fresher as they knew they had 45 minutes to realistically save their season and although McClean, Pennant and Bo-kyung tried to link up and break down Wolves, they again lacked any real cutting edge. Wigan's James Perch and Wigan's Marc-Antoine Fortune head off dejected after the final whistle . Wigan supporters begin to come to terms with the fact that relegation is out of their hands . However, it was the same at both ends with Nouha Dicko and Sako both having little say in the game and although Afobe did find the back of the net after 57 minutes, his handball in the build-up was spotted by the referee who disallowed the effort. With half an hour to go, Wolves should have been 2-0 up but Wigan had keeper Carson to thank for blocking Dicko as he ran through on goal. And Carson was also at his best soon after when Afobe’s corner was superbly flicked goalwards by Dave Edwards but the former England No.1 brilliantly tipped over to keep the Latics in the contest. His team-mates responded to his efforts by launching a late charge at Wolves with James Perch and McClean both looking to surge forward and get on the scoresheet. Both sets of players observe a minute's silence to mark the anniversary of the Bradford stadium fire . Last week, when Wigan threw caution to the wind against Brighton they were rewarded with a late three points and they tried the same again in this match but they could not quite manage it. And when McClean picked up a second yellow in the dying moments , Wigan’s hopes left the field with him. Both these teams can still get what they want out of this season. But only just. And next Saturday will have to be really, truly remarkable if that is to happen.","Wolves hopes of Championship promotion remain after defeat of Wigan .

The law student spent a staggering £5,460 every year on the popular energy drink  since she became hooked in 2009. Scroll down for video . Sarah Weatherill, 31, was so addicted to Red Bull she drank 24 cans a day leaving her lethargic, depressed, suffering heart palpitations and constantly anxious . Her habit was at its worst the following year when she was studying for a law degree and wanted to stay awake to revise for exams. She soon became dependent on the drink and couldn't get out of bed unless she knew she had some in the fridge. She also became lethargic, depressed, had heart palpitations and was constantly feeling anxious as her £105-a-week habit spiralled out of control. She finally decided to do something about the problem after she realised the constant need for the Red Bull was severely damaging her health. And after seeing hypnotherapist earlier this month, she claims she has been cured of her addiction thanks to just one 50-minute session. Her habit had been so dangerous she needed to cut down to eight cans a day in the run up to the hypnosis - as coming off so much caffeine abruptly could have caused a seizure. A 250ml can of Red Bull contains: . 80mg of caffeine - the same amount as in an espresso. 27.5g sucrose and glucose combined - the equivalent of almost seven teaspoons of sugar. 10g Taurine (an amino acid that is thought to boost athletic performance). B vitamins. Ms Weatherill's 24-a-day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day. A 2005 study into caffeine-related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose, suggesting she was taking nearly half the potentially lethal dose. Ms Weatherill, from Coventry, said: 'I was studying for a Higher National Certificate in law in 2005 and used to have the odd Red Bull for a pick me up. 'It is hard to say when it became every day but I remember that by 2009 I was definitely hooked. 'Whenever I felt tired having a Red Bull would be the first thing I would do. 'It was  worst in 2010 when I was doing law exams at university and my children were off school. 'Sometimes I would have exams day after day - and with the stress of revising I was having 24 cans a day. 'I was pulling all-nighters and using the drinks to stay awake. In the end, it got to the point where I just needed Red Bull to function. 'I used to get my shopping delivered and used to have four or five crates and that only lasted for a week - it got out of hand. 'There would be times when I would get palpitations and shakes but I think I just got used to the caffeine.' Red Bull - whose slogan says the drink 'gives you wings' - is made by an Austrian company and is the highest selling energy drink in the world. Miss Weatherill claims she was cured of her addiction in one 50 minutes hypnotherapy session with David Kilmurry (pictured right) This table shows a range of drinks in order of caffeine content and their relation to daily allowances. Ms Weatherill was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day, way above the recommended limit of 400 mg . The drink has been branded safe by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and more than five billion cans were sold in 2013. However, it has been criticised for its high caffeine levels with one 250ml can containing 80mg, similar to one cup of coffee. Ms Weatherill's 24-a-day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of the drug every day. A 2005 study into caffeine-related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose, suggesting she was taking nearly half of a lethal dose. But, incredibly, she claims she was completely cured of her addiction after a single session with cognitive behavioral hypnotherapist David Kilmurry on April 11. Ms Weatherill, who lives with boyfriend Phil Evans, 27, and four children aged between three and 14, added: 'I knew at the start of this year it was a dependency so thought I would give hypnotherapy a go. 'It was a weird process, I felt like I was in there for 15 minutes but it was 50 minutes. 'All I can remember is that it was like a kaleidoscope effect, I remember him saying I didn't need Red Bull.' 'I am convinced I won't have another can. I feel like a different person,' Ms Weatherill said after undergoing hypnotherapy to cure her of her energy drink habit . She added: 'It was like a paralysis because I had an itch, but couldn't move to scratch it. 'It gave me a lot of strength because in the past I have tried to give up but lasted a week and then gone back to the Red Bull. 'I am convinced I won't have another can. I feel like a different person.' Hypnotherapist Mr Kilmurry added: 'Sarah's addiction was very serious. 'Coming off that amount of caffeine and taurine  can lead to seizures, so she gradually reduced her intake before coming to me to make a safe escape. 'Energy drink addicts can also suffer insomnia, depression, anxiety and heart palpitations. 'Luckily Sarah soldiered through and has been amazed at the changes.'","Sarah Weatherill, 31, spent £5, 460 every year on the popular energy drink .

"Former Chelsea star Michael Essien's £75,000 Range Rover Vogue has been stolen from the driveway of his Surrey home. Burglars targeted the property, in Cobham where Chelsea's training ground is based,  and made off with the 4x4. Ghana midfielder Essien, 32, left the Blues for Italian club AC Milan in January 2014 but still owns the property purchased during his time at Stamford Bridge. Former Chelsea midfielder Essien had a Range Rover Vogue stolen from outside his property in Surrey . The road in Cobham, Surrey, where luxury cars were stolen from in an early morning raid .

"Thierry Henry believes Arsenal need to sign four new players this summer if they are to challenge for the Premier League title next season. 'Arsenal need to buy four players, they need that spine,' the Frenchman told Sky Sports. 'They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I’m afraid, they need a top, top-quality striker in order to win this league again.' Here, Sportsmail’s Simon Jones analyses the possible options for Arsenal in key positions. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger will be looking to add to his squad ahead of the 2015-16 Premier League season . GOALKEEPERS . PETR CECH . Chelsea . Cost: £10million . Jose Mourinho says it will cost 'huge money' for Cech who at 32 is still reliable and a calming influence. Paris Saint-Germain remain the front-runners for his signature although Liverpool maintain hope too. The figures and Cech's age would normally act as a deterrent for the cash-conscious Arsene Wenger. However, Cech's experience could settle an often nervy defence and lift the performance levels of those around him. Petr Cech looks set to leave Chelsea after losing his No 1 spot to Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois . BERND LENO . Bayer Leverkusen . Cost: £12million . Arsenal have a keen interest in the 23-year-old German Under 21 international. He already has good experience having made his Champions League debut against Chelsea in 2011 at 19. Arsenal scouts watching his team-mate Lars Bender have been impressed and Leno is interested in a move. His contract runs to 2018 but he said: 'The foreign option is certainly appealing. A new language, a new culture - that I could definitely imagine.' Bernd Leno pulls off a brilliant save during Bayer Leverkusen's 1-1 Bundesliga draw against Cologne . MATTIA PERIN . Genoa . Cost: £16million . Arsenal have pondered the experience of Real Madrid's Iker Casillas, the promise of Mainz's Loris Karius but Mattia Perin at Genoa keeps cropping up on their scouting lists. He is 22 and tipped to become the new Gianluigi Buffon but Arsenal have watched him for three years now. Liverpool have also considered him as have Inter Milan. Another option with Premier League experience and at a similar price who has been discussed is Asmir Begovic of Stoke City. Arsenal have been scouting 22-year-old Genoa goalkeeper Mattia Perin for the past three years . DEFENDERS . ALEKSANDAR DRAGOVIC . Dinamo Kiev . Cost: £12million . Dragovic has been watched several times by Arsenal scouts. The Austria international is the subject of interest from Inter Milan and they are keen to strike a deal at the end of the season. Manchester United and West Ham have also watched Dragovic after first being alerted when he played for Basle alongside Fabian Schar. Arsenal though remain unsure Dragovic is for them. The Gunners have been keeping track of Aleksandar Dragovic but the Austrian is a target for Inter Milan . AYMEN ABDENNOUR . Monaco . Cost: £10million . The 25-year-old Tunisia international has not long extended his contract until 2019 but would like to join Arsenal who have had scouts posted at most Monaco games throughout the season. They are well aware of Abdennour, who has over 30 international caps and has progressed from his time at Toulouse. He is left-sided, has good pace and can pass well. He also had the measure of Olivier Giroud at the Emirates in February. Newcastle and Tottenham have checked on him also. Aymen Abdennour has not long extended his Monaco deal until 2019 but would like to join Arsenal . HECTOR MORENO . Espanyol . Cost: £8million . Arsenal scout Brian McDermott checked on Moreno last January as the Mexico international made his return to fitness from a broken leg he suffered last summer. They have maintained their interest in the 27-year-old who is highly rated by former coach Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham. He is up for sale as Espanyol look to raise funds and has made 23 appearances since December. He was sent off in the derby against Barcelona at the weekend and could prove a cheaper back-up option. Hector Moreno (left) could be leaving Espanyol as the Spanish club look to raise funds this summer . DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDERS . GEOFFREY KONDOGBIA . Monaco . Cost: £20million . Arsenal are back on the trail of Kondogbia after he impressed against them in the Champions League. Liverpool have also watched the 22-year-old Frenchman but Wenger and Champions League football will strengthen Arsenal's hand if they choose to step up interest. Much depends how Francis Coquelin performs between now and the end of the season but Kondogbia is a player of great potential. Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia would give Arsene Wenger an alternative to Francis Coquelin . MORGAN SCHNEIDERLIN . Southampton . Cost: £30million . Like Lars Bender of Bayer Leverkusen and Moussa Sissoko at Newcastle, Schneiderlin is a player who has been long admired by Wenger. He is expected to be the subject of an early summer bid from Arsenal. Southampton want him to stay but have already earmarked players to replace him should he go. Tottenham, Manchester United and Liverpool have also looked at the 25-year-old France international, who is one of the league's best midfielders. Morgan Schneiderlin (centre) has long been admired by Wenger and looks set to leave Southampton . JAMES McCARTHY . Everton . Cost: £30million . Everton do not wish to sell but McCarthy is a player Arsenal like a lot. Tottenham's head of recruitment Paul Mitchell also has the Republic of Ireland international high on his wishlist and the north London neighbours will test Everton's resolve as they formalise summer plans. McCarthy is still only 24 but has plenty of experience. Highly regarded by his team-mates and coaches alike, he can also play a more advanced role if required. James McCarthy celebrates scoring Everton's opening goal against Manchester United on Sunday . CENTRE FORWARDS . MARIO MANDZUKIC . Atletico Madrid . Cost: £20million . Aggressive, skilful and a goalscorer. Mandzukic is a handful on and off the pitch but he would give Arsenal an edge they lack. He fell out with Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich and his relationship with Diego Simeone has been strained. His representatives have already sounded out Premier League clubs and he seems intent on a move to England. Wenger wanted him last summer but the Croat was keen to replace Diego Costa at Atletico. Mario Mandzukic seems intent on a move to England and Wenger wanted the striker last summer . ALEXANDRE LACAZETTE . Lyon . Cost: £25million . Cash-strapped Lyon are doing their best to hike up the price of their star striker and he seems intent on leaving with Manchester City and Liverpool also among clubs to have checked on him this season. He has 28 goals in 32 games, breaking club records, but has struggled against the top sides. Still only 23, Lacazette can play off either wing and act as a foil to a big target man. Fits Arsenal's style and life with Wenger would be a big pull for the ambitious Frenchman. Alexandre Lacazette (right) has scored 28 goals in 32 games for Lyon so far this season . EDINSON CAVANI . Paris Saint-Germain . Cost: £35million . Cavani has been looking for a move away from Paris for the past year and Juventus are very keen. His representatives held talks with Manchester United last year and he was ready to join prior to David Moyes departing. PSG do not wish to sell though and Arsenal have been considering other options such as Napoli's Gonzalo Higuain, Mattia Destro at Roma and Palermo's Paulo Dybala, but he is keen to stay in Italy. Edinson Cavani has been looking for a move away from Paris and has been linked to Arsenal .","Thierry Henry wants Arsenal to sign a 'spine' of top players .

"UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones ran from a crash that hospitalised a pregnant woman - but quickly came back to grab 'a large handful of cash' from the car, witnesses told police. According to police, the accident occurred in southeastern Albuquerque just before noon on Sunday local time when the driver of a rented SUV jumped a red light. The driver, whom an off-duty officer identified as Jones, ran from the scene but then returned for the cash before fleeing again, police said. 'Witnesses stated he shoved the cash into his pants and ran north jumping the fence,' the report said. Officers found a pipe with marijuana in the vehicle as well as MMA and rental car documents in Jones' name, according to the police report. Police were searching for UFC  champion Jon Jones in connection with a hit-and-run accident . Albuquerque police were seeking an arrest warrant for Jones on Monday. They said he would likely face a felony charge of leaving the scene of an accident since the woman broke her arm in the crash. Police said in a news release they'd been unable to reach Jones or his lawyer. However, Jones handed himself in later the same day, with TMZ reporting he was being held at Bernalillo County Metropolitan Detention Center. According to the warrant, the pregnant woman told police she was driving when she was hit by a silver Buick SUV. According to the document, she told authorities after the accident  'I am pregnant and I feel like I am going to pass out. My arm is hurting all the way up and my husband is going to take me to the hospital.' The woman's arm is in a sling and she will get a cast on Tuesday, the warrant said. According to the warrant, she was planning to undergo a Monday ultrasound. The warrant also said the off-duty officer  told responding police he could confirm Jones' identity because 'I watch UFC all the time, I know what Jon Jones looks like.' An agent for Jones, Malki Kawa, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment from Daily Mail Online on Monday. Kawa also did not immediately respond to a message from Associated Press. Jones (21-1) is scheduled to defend his title against Anthony 'Rumble'Johnson at UFC 187 in Las Vegas on May 23, headlining one of the promotion's biggest shows of the year. Police were seeking an arrest warrant for Jones on Monday, saying he would likely face a felony charge . Jones has endured legal problems and questionable behaviour during his time as a UFC champion . 'We are aware that the Albuquerque Police Department is interested in speaking to Jon Jones regarding his possible involvement in a motor vehicle accident,' the UFC said in a Sunday statement. The message continued: 'We are in the process of gathering facts and will reserve further comment until more information is available.' Although he is widely considered the world's best pound-for-pound mixed martial artist, Jones has endured legal problems and questionable behaviour as champion.

"Pictures of Suge Knight showing he had virtually no facial injuries after he was arrested for killing one man and seriously injuring another in his pickup truck have been released. The co-founder of Death Row Records was punched a number of times during the deadly confrontation, but close-ups  taken by detectives show he only had a slight black eye. The images were released along with a number of key pieces of evidence as the court was shown footage of the deadly incident in Compton on January 18 for the first time. Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen reviewed the items before determining Knight, 49, should stand trial on murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges. Scroll down for video . A photo of Suge Knight just after his arrest was released in court along with footage of him plowing into two men in his pickup truck in January . Another photo of the 49-year-old after he was detained was released by the court. Knight has pleaded not guilty to killing Terry Carter and trying to kill Cle 'Bone' Sloan. The close ups were intended to show the injuries he sustained from being punched in the face during the confrontation . Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen ruled Thursday that there was enough evidence for Knight, 49, to stand trial on charges he killed Terry Carter and attempted to kill Sloan during a parking lot confrontation. The images show . The video shows Knight's pickup truck (top left) pulling up to the driveway of the burger stand and Cle 'Bone' Sloan approaching the driver's side window. Sloan then approaches the driver's side window and punches the 49-year-old in response to a flurry of insults. Knight's pickup is seen backing up, throwing Sloan to the ground before the truck drives over his legs and then plows over Terry Carter - who died as a result. Among the other key pieces of evidence shown to the court were images of Knight taken immediately after his arrest. An hour-long interview with Sloan, who survived, describing what happened was also released. Coen ruled Thursday that there was enough evidence for Knight, 49, to stand trial on charges he killed Terry Carter and attempted to kill Sloan during a parking lot confrontation in late January. Knight has pleaded not guilty. His attorney has said Knight was fleeing an ambush by Sloan and others when he hit the men outside a Compton burger stand. The entire incident took approximately 30 seconds. The video, shot by a surveillance camera monitoring the drive-thru at the burger stand, continues until the arrival of a paramedic. The footage is likely to be used by both sides during Knight's trial. The footage, which was played by the prosecutor for the first time, shows Suge Knight's pickup truck (top left) pulling up to the driveway of a burger stand in Compton on January 29 . Just seconds later, there is a confrontation between Knight Cle 'Bone' Sloan and Terry Carter. Knight runs over Sloan's leg and then plows into Carter . Sloan is then seen lying on the ground in the aftermath. A bystander then runs over to help . Los Angeles Superior Court also released an image of the truck the rap mogul was driving when he ran over the two men . Knight's attorney, Matt Fletcher, has said the video appears to show an associate of Sloan's taking a gun off of him after he is run over, and jurors likely will be shown an enhanced version of the video. Knight turned himself in to authorities the morning after the incident. Detectives took pictures of him to try to show he did not have any serious injuries from the attack. Sloan's interview with detectives will also be crucial to the case since he is unlikely to repeat the lucid account of the event and his own actions that he gave investigators. In court on Monday, Sloan repeatedly said he didn't remember the incident and refused to identify Knight as the person who injured him, saying he didn't want . Knight's attorney's say he was trying to flee and ambush. He is pictured on the night of his arrest .

"The Mail is asking you to nominate mothers who have created businesses from scratch, while also caring for their children, for our first ever Mumpreneur Of The Year Award, in association with NatWest everywoman Awards. Today’s nominee is Petra Wetzel, 40, a divorcee who lives in Glasgow with her son, Noah, nine. She set up her own business, the WEST brewery, in 2006... Listening to the Italian businessman on the other end of the line, Petra could see pound signs in front of her eyes. He had heard about the huge popularity of Petra’s bottled beer. Now he wanted to meet to discuss importing it in bulk to Italy. It was a fantastic opportunity. But, as she consulted her diary, Petra — who runs one of Britain’s most successful small breweries, knew what her answer had to be. Petra Wetzel, 40 (pictured), is a divorcee who lives in Glasgow with her son, Noah, nine (pictured). She set up her own business, the WEST brewery, in 2006 . ‘He could only offer me a two-hour slot bang in the middle of my son’s sports day last year,’ recalls Petra. ‘I had to say No. I’m a businesswoman, but I’m a mum first.’ Blonde, attractive and the founder of one of Britain’s most successful small breweries with an annual turnover just shy of £10 million, Petra may well be every man’s dream. But she says with a laugh: ‘I sound like a real catch. But the truth is I’m fiercely independent, stubborn and work long hours. The only man in my life is Noah. He’s my priority and the reason I drive myself so hard.’ As a single mother, running a hugely successful business is a tall order. What makes Petra’s success even more extraordinary is that she started her company when Noah was just a baby — and in the wake of a broken marriage. Petra’s flagship beer, St Mungo lager, is stocked in 100 branches of Waitrose in the UK as well as in branches of Tesco in Scotland. And later this year she is opening a second brewery in Glasgow to cope with demand. The germ of the idea came in 1994 when Petra, who was born in Germany, was having a drink with her father, Herbert, in a pub. ‘I was studying at Glasgow University and Dad had come to visit,’ she recalls. Petra (pictured) was inspired to start her own brewery when her father visited her Glasgow and she realised that the city didn't have its own brewery . He ordered a pint of local lager, took a sip and winced. Then he asked what the best Glasgow lager was and, to my horror, I realised I didn’t know. ‘In Germany, every village and town has a good brewery. It’s something people are proud of and want to show off to visitors. He couldn’t believe that a city like Glasgow didn’t have its own brewery. It got me thinking.’ Twelve years later, Petra opened a small brewery and beer hall/restaurant with her then husband, Gordon, with the help of a loan from her parents. ‘I met Gordon at university and married him in December 2000,’ recalls Petra. ‘We both had first-class business degrees and, naively, I thought that meant we could easily run a business. I was working as a lawyer, so we agreed Gordon would take charge and I would take a back seat.’ WEST Brewing Company opened in March 2006, just eight months after Noah was born. ‘He was conceived on a trip to Chicago, where we’d gone to learn about brewing,’ Petra recalls. ‘I had been told that I could never have children so, although the timing was terrible because of the new business, we were both ecstatic.’ She adds: ‘We had bills to pay, so I was working three days a week just two months after Noah arrived. With my legal job and a newborn, I didn’t have time to think about the business. Besides, I thought it was in safe hands.’ The WEST Brewing Company opened in March 2006, just eight months after Petra's son, Noah was born. She initially started the company with Gordan, her then husband . However, in October 2006, when Noah was just three months old, Petra’s life went into free fall when her marriage fell apart. ‘I was so devastated, I decided to step away from the business. I focused on looking after Noah and my job.’ However, in December 2007, a little over a year after the break-up of their marriage, Petra had another shock: the business was in crisis. ‘Gordon was away when the butcher who supplied our restaurant rang and threatened to set fire to my car,’ she recalls. ‘It turned out the company owed him thousands. ‘When I went round to the company’s office. I filled a black bin liner with our unpaid invoices, went home and spent the night going over them. We had debts up to our eyeballs.’ Many women would have quit. But looking at her son, Petra realised she didn’t have a choice. ‘It was sink or swim. Noah gave me the confidence I needed,’ says Petra. ‘We had ploughed my inheritance into the business. It was all I had. Besides, I knew I’d hit on a great idea. All it needed was graft to make it work. My parents agreed to look after Noah for seven weeks in Germany. The company went into administration. I called in a brilliant firm of accountants and worked flat out on a plan for the future. Petra (pictured with Noah) says her son gave her the confidence she needed to carry on with the business even after the initial struggles . ‘It was tough. Noah went into full-time day care and most nights I would still be at my laptop at 1am. Many times, I sobbed myself to sleep. I felt way out of my depth, but I became good at multi-tasking. ‘I quit my legal job and bought the assets out of the hands of administrators and began building it, single-handedly, into the thriving company it is today. We are now a beer brand as well as a restaurant and beer hall. And our flagship beer, St Mungo lager, is sold worldwide. We are just about to send a consignment to Hong Kong. Of course, I have to make tough choices. I could beat myself up about not being there enough for Noah. I’ve lost count of the number of times he will be in the car and I have to shush him because I’m taking an important call. ‘But feeling guilty is just a waste of energy. Noah knows he’s my priority. We are a very tight unit — particularly as his father now lives in America. We have the most wonderful full-time nanny, Helen, who Noah adores, and I spend every second I’m not working with him. ‘Recently he said: “Mum you are a brilliant Mum and a brilliant Dad.” That meant the world to me. ‘And thanks to the business, we have a great lifestyle. For my 40th birthday I bought us a treat: a speedboat. It’s moored at Loch Lomond and zipping up and down the water at weekends makes a tough working week worthwhile.’","There are more and more mothers setting up thriving small businesses .

Randy Boehning, a 52-year-old who's represented Fargo since 2002, sent messages and a photo of his penis to a 21-year-old gay man in Bismark named Dustin Smith. Smith recognized the staunch conservative and took his story, and explicit photo, to the press. But, while admitting he's gay and uses Grindr, the public official claimed his private life was revealed as part of a fellow lawmaker's retaliation for his vote against a bill that would afford protections to gays. Smith told Forum on Monday that he first recognized Boehning, who he knew by the Grindr handle Top Man!, while reading an April 2 article that pictured all the state's House of Representatives members who voted down an anti-discrimination bill. 'Suddenly it dawned on me: I think I've seen this guy on Grindr!' Smith told the Washington Post on Wednesday. Using the 'an all-male location-based social network' on his phone, Smith retrieved the conversation in question in which Boehning, without solicitation, sent a photo of his penis along with one of his face. 'I just felt like this story had to get out,' Smith said. '[He] voted against a bill for the LGBT community and here he was talking to me on Grindr.' Forum ran their story on Monday, in which Boehning both came out and accused an employee at his workplace for exposing him after he exposed himself. 'That's what gay guys do on gay sites, don't they?' Boehning told Forum. 'That's how things happen on Grindr. It's a gay chat site. It's not the first thing you do on that site. That's what we do, exchange pics on the site.' Top Man! Dustin Smith, a 21-year-old gay man who lives in Bismarck, recognized Boehning as Grindr user Top Man! and took his story to the local press . Boehning went on to claim that, prior to his April 2 vote against the anti-discrimination bill, a capitol employee warned him that a fellow lawmaker who supported the bill vowed Boehning would become a target for retaliation should he vote no. However, Boehning has thus far refused to name that lawmaker. Meanwhile, the only openly gay lawmaker in the state's legislature, Rep. Josh Boschee of Fargo, said he never spoke to Boehning about the vote. Boschee claims he's been told of a Republican staffer who's been in contact with Boehning via Grindr since he was last elected and who warned Boehning 'there could be consequences for the hypocrisy of [his] vote.' Boschee also declined to name any names. As for his coming out, Boehning, who says he's also attracted to women, seemed somewhat relieved. 'The 1,000-pound gorilla has been lifted,' he said. 'I have to confront it at some point.' Blackmailed? Boehning claims he was blackmailed by a Capitol employee just before his most recent vote against a gay rights bill. Weeks later, he was outed .","Dustin Smith, a 21-year-old gay man in Bismarck, received messages and explicit photos from user going by Top Man! on Grindr .

"Sunday, April 26. That is when it becomes real. The second act of Tony McCoy's life. On Saturday he will dismount from the bay gelding Box Office after the 4.25pm at Sandown Park – the Bet365 Handicap Hurdle – and it will begin. Perhaps it will not quite sink in, at first, amid the cheers and roars, the hoopla and a presentation from Ian Wright, an Arsenal hero, as befits McCoy's club allegiance. Yet the following morning, when McCoy awakes an ex-jockey, he will understand there are no more competitive rides, no more races, no more Cheltenhams or Aintrees or even modest little handicap hurdles to separate him from the field. Just entries in record books and the fact he will never have to put his hand in his pocket at any racetrack in Britain or Ireland to remind him of what was. AP McCoy will race at Sandown on Saturday for the last time before he retires after a successful career . To date, McCoy has 4,357 winning memories. Eddie Arcaro had 4,779, including five Kentucky Derbys. He was known as The Master in American racing, comparable in his field to baseball legend Joe DiMaggio and golf's Jack Nicklaus. 'I liked being a celebrity, if I'm being honest,' Arcaro said. 'When a jockey retires he becomes just another little man.' Arcaro was retired 36 years before succumbing to liver cancer in 1997. It cannot be said that McCoy has courted celebrity, or that he will ever be regarded as a little man by racegoers, yet as he scurries to his new life, minus its thrills, spills and the snap of broken bones, one cannot help but ask: why? To be a jockey is to live a life of denial, early nights, early mornings, restraint at the dinner table, water at the bar, long, hot baths to sweat out the weight that, in McCoy's case, lowered his sperm count. His children were born through IVF treatment. Yet not one of McCoy's thoughts on retiring has centred greatly on the inconveniences or even the pain of injury. He doesn't now talk excitedly of lavish lunches or late nights, of never having to look at a fractured vertebrae via x-ray; there is no hint of the social whirl experienced by Sir Alex Ferguson on stepping down at Manchester United. McCoy will host a party at home on Sunday for family, friends and his closest racing colleagues, and the next day travel to the Punchestown festival with JP McManus, as a spectator. The rest of his retirement talk amounts to wishful thinking. McCoy simply reiterates he would still like to be riding. If he could ride in disguise for another three years he would do just that. McCoy (left) and wife Chanelle will host a party at home on Sunday for family and friends . And why would he need a mask? That is the puzzle of McCoy's decision: the fear that appears to be at the heart of it. He is genuinely, unfathomably, unnerved by the thought of staying too long, of not going out a winner. True, Brian Clough was relegated in his final season at Nottingham Forest, Sugar Ray Leonard's last comeback of four ended in an early stoppage, Paul Gascoigne travelled to pitifully obscure outposts trying to cling on to what remained of his professional career. Yet, another year of McCoy? Another year of the man who currently leads the Jump Jockeys Championship by an insurmountable margin? Random misfortune aside, we know full well what would happen if he stayed on another year. He would be champion jockey a 21st time. To put this view into perspective, the gap between McCoy and Tom Scudamore, who is in second place in the jockey's table, is 82 wins, while the gap between Scudamore and third-placed Richard Johnson is two. Between Johnson and Sam Twiston-Davies it is four, between Twiston-Davies and Brian Hughes, 37. There is no margin anywhere comparable to the distance McCoy and the rest. There is no-one on his shoulder, no-one breathing down his neck, no-one gaining on him up the hill. What worries him – that people may think he is not the rider of old – is several years away, at least. Hence his fantasy of racing in disguise, without the burden of history. 'I'd ride forever if I could,' he explained. Ferguson got out of Manchester United at the right time. He could not have foreseen the calamitous fall of David Moyes' first season, but he must have had an inkling that his team might find it hard to retain their title. A businessman, too, Ferguson would have known the commercial cache in leaving a winner – the opportunities in the world of publishing, or at Harvard and beyond. Here was his chance – and who knows when the conditions would be right again? A man of many interests, and past retirement age, he stood down and prepared to enjoy life. It was absolutely the right thing to do. McCoy is unnerved by the thought of staying too long, of not going out a winner . Yet McCoy's farewell is almost troubling. 'When he retired, they should have shot him,' said Jack Charlton of his brother, Bobby. 'I've never seen anybody so unhappy.' Sir Bobby has, thankfully, since made the second life all great sportsmen crave, as an ambassador for Manchester United and the Football Association, and a voice of reason within the boardroom at Old Trafford. McCoy, almost certainly, will find a berth in racing where his expertise will be valued, no doubt with JP McManus. Yet it still won't be Fakenham on a wet Thursday – it won't be the Weatherbys Novice Hurdle at Towcester, in which McCoy piloted his 4,000th winner, Mountain Tunes. For an athlete at the top as McCoy has been for so long, nothing can quite compare to the thrill of competition. For McCoy, any competition. The sheer number of times he took a race on sets him apart. In 2001-02, he rode over 1,000 times in Britain alone and since Richard Dunwoody claimed 160 winners to be crowned champion jump jockey in 1994-95, McCoy has surpassed that total in each of his 20 seasons. There will never be another like him – a fact he wanted to make sure of before retiring. It was important he would go to his grave unmatched. Brian Clough was relegated in his final season as manager at Nottingham Forest . Yet it is that determination, the desire for the victory no matter how small, that cannot be replicated in retirement. Gary Neville is very serious about his media work and won a broadcast award given by the Royal Television Society in March. His bosses at Sky wanted him to make a fuss about it. He refused. He wouldn't even recognise the news on his Twitter page. It was clear he didn't feel this achievement compared to those in his playing career. Then last week, when Salford City – the club he owns along with other members of the Class of 92 – won Northern Premier League Division One North, Neville was all over it. Whatever McCoy's place in the world from here, it cannot compare to the thrill of the chase. That is why punters loved him, why his farewell at Sandown has long been a sell-out. This is a jockey who – on at least two occasions – rode winners that had drifted to 999-1 on Betfair at the midway stage. He was unseated by Family Business at Southwell in 2002 but kept watching the race and, on seeing the other four competitors variously fall or retire, remounted and won. Two years later, on the aptly named Mini Sensation at Exeter, he almost lost touch with the field with a circuit to go, before hitting the front 50 yards out. Mini Sensation had recorded eight straight losses going into that race. Paul Gascoigne (left) travelled to pitifully obscure outposts in the twilight of his career . McCoy's wife, Chanelle, will be pleased her husband no longer risks adding to a roll call of injuries that make the longevity of his time at the top all the more remarkable – and McCoy's father says he no longer enjoys watching him race. Maybe, deep down, even McCoy himself wondered how long he could continue to dodge the big one – the fall that might challenge his champion status. 'One minute you're a world-class athlete, walking down the road, holding your head up, feeling bullet-proof,' said Billy Schwer, former IBO light-welterweight champion, now retired. 'You're Billy the Boxer. Then, in an instant, just Billy.' McCoy has been trying to prepare himself for that moment all week. He turned down rides at Perth to give him the feel of spare time before sundown at Sandown. He is not looking forward to the weekend after, when he feels it will truly hit home. 'A lot of people wanted me to go to Perth,' McCoy said, 'but if I went to Perth I could think 'why not do one more week at Punchestown?' A lot of days I wish I wasn't doing it, that I hadn't said it. But I'm not changing my mind. I'm too stubborn for that.' Legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson got out of Manchester United at the right time . He leaves having transformed his sport, having helped create four-day festivals that capture the imagination like at no time in history. He leaves having dominated for 20 years – a feat unparalleled, setting records that will not be so much as glimpsed at a distance, let alone challenged in his lifetime. And he leaves sounding every bit as certain as Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre did in 2008, bringing the curtain down on a career of similar achievement. 'I've given everything I can possibly give to this organisation,' Favre said. 'I don't think I have anything left to give. It's over. As hard as it is for me to say, it's over. I will wonder if I made the wrong decision. I'm sure on Sundays I will say I could be doing that or I should be doing that. But all good things must come to an end.' The world agreed, and wished him well. The next year, he was back.","AP McCoy finished well ahead of rivals in Jump Jockeys Championship .

"Former super middleweight champion Nigel Benn is back in the ring and the 51-year-old, dubbed the ‘Dark Destroyer’, has certainly still got what it takes. Ilford-born Benn, who now lives in Australia and works as a charity worker, looked as sharp as ever as he joined in a playful pad session with Ricky Hatton at his Manchester gym. Benn landed a series of punches, including one that saw Hatton's glove fly off, as he put the 36-year-old through his paces following his return to England. Earlier this week, Hatton and Benn met up to discuss the possibility of the ‘Hitman' training Conor Benn, Nigel’s son, ahead of the 2016 Olympics in Rio.

The younger Benn will have to go some way before he manages to surpass the accomplishments of his Dad, though, a man remembered as one of the top 10 British boxers of all time. Benn secured 22 straight knockouts in just over two years as a professional and didn't taste defeat till he came up against the underrated Michael Watson. That rare taste of defeat led to the boxer taking a gamble on life in America and he quickly won the WBO middleweight title after stopping Doug De Witt in a brutal encounter. Benn stopped Iran Barkley in just one round in a title defending performance that shocked the world in his next bout as people began to discuss just how far he could go. Barkley had been in the ring with the likes of Roberto Duran and Thomas Hearns, but there was more to come from Benn as he returned to Britain to fight Chris Eubank. The bout against Eubank was a fight that well and truly grabbed the attentions of the British public as both fighters went hell for leather as soon as the bell went. Benn knocked Eubank to the canvas during that fight, the first time Eubank had ever been sent to ground during his career.

"With its gabled, late-Victorian red-brick exterior and oak-panelled interior, Cournswood House could almost be Bletchley Park, the English country house at the heart of the recent Oscar-nominated drama The Imitation Game, about the cracking of Germany's wartime Enigma code. So it is appropriate that at least two of Cournswood's long-term residents have had strong Bletchley connections. The first was wartime Naval cryptographer and Enigma codebreaker Dillwyn Knox, who bought it in 1921 and lived there until his death in 1943. His funeral was attended by many from Bletchley Park, and a memorial stone to Knox can be found bordering the property. Cournswood House is in the south of Buckinghamshire – in ten acres of secluded woodlands in the picturesque village of North Dean . Bletchley connections: Codebreaker Dillwyn Knox, left, who bought it in 1921 and lived there until his death in 1943 and right, Sharon Constancon, who is related to the Leon family who once owned Bletchley Park . And the current owner, businesswoman Sharon Constancon, is related to the Leon family who once owned Bletchley Park. 'I only discovered this when I went on a visit to Bletchley Park with my uncle,' says Sharon. 'The Leon family donated the building to the Government in 1937 for use as a code-breaking centre.' While both are in Buckinghamshire, Cournswood House is in the south of the county – in ten acres of secluded woodlands in the picturesque village of North Dean – while Bletchley Park is in the town of Bletchley in the north, 20 miles away. During the Second World War at Bletchley Park, Dillwyn Knox led the team that made the first breaks into the code Germany was using, and he encouraged Alan Turing – the subject of The Imitation Game – in his work there. Although Knox does not feature in the new movie, he was portrayed by actor Richard Johnson in the 1996 television film Breaking The Code, which starred Derek Jacobi as Turing and Prunella Scales as his wife Sara. The pool is in a glasshouse, where vines thrive in the heated environment. A separate glasshouse houses the Jacuzzi and a herb garden . Cracking mysteries seems to be something Knox enjoyed in his private life too, as novelist Agatha Christie was a good friend and often visited Cournswood. 'I fell in love with Cournswood House the moment I saw it,' says Sharon, who bought it in 2003. 'It's an outstanding property with lots of potential.' Apart from the main house, there are two cottages, offices, a swimming pool, Jacuzzi, gym, and woodland with lakes, Japanese-style bridges, waterfalls and fountains. The pool is in a glasshouse, where vines thrive in the heated environment. 'The grapes are perfect for making chutney,' says Sharon. A separate glasshouse houses the Jacuzzi and a herb garden. Price: £4million . Location: North Dean, Buckinghamshire . Bedrooms: 5 . Unique features: Office suite, indoor swimming pool, two cottages, Jacuzzi, gym, grass tennis court, former home of wartime codebreaker Dillwyn Knox . There are five bedrooms, four bathrooms (two en suite) and five reception rooms. The large drawing room has high ceilings, ornate cornicing and a fireplace with carved wooden mantel and surround. Double doors open on to a triple-tiered terrace, with an open barbecue, that overlooks the lakes and woodlands. In the dining room, solid parquet flooring continues through to the serving room, reached through a pair of oak double doors. The modern kitchen is a chef's delight, with Gaggenau and Miele ovens. In the centre is an island incorporating a breakfast bar and storage units. 'I love entertaining and the kitchen offers everything you could possibly want,' says Sharon. The reception hall features a sweeping staircase to the first floor, where there are the bedrooms and bathrooms as well as two dressing rooms and a TV/cinema room. The master bedroom opens on to a circular balcony with stunning views over the gardens, lakes and woods. In the library, still concealed behind one of the wall panels, is Knox's private safe. One of the property's cottages overlooks the lakes, while the other is on the edge of the woods. 'Both cottages are ideal for short- or long-term lets or for staff, friends or family visits,' says Sharon. At the entrance to the property there are electric gates with majestic stone golden eagles perched on top of pillars. 'I'm moving to downsize,' says Sharon. 'I'll miss the privacy, security and tranquillity, not to mention the wildlife, such as deer, red kites and ducks.' hamptons-int.com, 01494 611313 .","Two of Cournswood House's owners had Bletchley Park connections .

"Police in Houston say a 34-year-old man got behind the wheel of his car while under the influence Sunday, leaving a path of destruction in his wake and killing two people, one of them a 6-year-old boy. Blaine Boudreaux has been charged with intoxication manslaughter, intoxicated assault and failure to stop and render aid involving death in connection to at least three separate DUI collisions that took place within three hours in Houston. Boudreaux, who also has an extensive DUI record in his native Louisiana, was allegedly drunk when he ran a red light on Lockwood Drive at around 6.3opm and slammed his Dodge pickup truck into a Honda Civic. Path of destruction: Blaine Boudreaux (left), 34, has been charged in connection to three separate DUI crashes in Houston that killed 6-year-old Josh Medrano, injured his mother and led to the death of a homeless man . Heartbroken: The family of 6-year-old Joshua Medrano are seen Wednesday leaving the courtroom where Blaine Boudreaux made an appearance on charges stemming from a trio of accidents in Houston. On of the boy's relatives screamed at the suspect: 'I hope you die!' Joshua Medrano, 6, who was a passenger in the sedan, was fatally injured. His mother, Cynthia, was hospitalized with a punctured lung and broken bones. Boudreaux was arrested at the scene after failing a field sobriety test. Three wrecks: The 34-year-old, who has a history of DUIs in Louisiana, is also accused of crashing into another car carrying a woman and a toddler . Several hours earlier, according to police, the 34-year-old man struck and killed 61-year-old vagrant Leonard Batiste walking along Texas 5 Spur near the University of Houston. Investigators say the homeless man was mowed down at around 5.15pm Sunday but his body was not discovered until Monday afternoon. Boudreaux’s entire bumper, complete with his license plate, was found nearby. Blaine Boudreaux also has been linked to a third collision that occurred about two hours before Batiste's death. The two-car crash took place in the 6600 block of Fannin Street and involved a mother and her 2-year-old child, who were taken to a hospital and later released. In that case, Boudreaux was issued a ticket by a police officer and allowed to leave the scene. After slamming into the elderly man on Texas 5 Spur, Boudreaux allegedly dozed off behind the wheel and didn't wake up until another driver honked at him to get his attention. That is when he ran the red light at the intersection of Lockwood and the East Freeway and slammed into Cynthia Medrano's black Honda, killing her son, according to officials. Joseph Rodriguez, the boy's stepfather, said little Joshua wanted to become a firefighter when he grew up. Rodriguez said the officer who stopped Boudreaux after the first accident involving the mother and toddler should have detained him instead of letting the man go. Prosecutor Alison Baimbridge told the Houston Chronicle investigators are now looking into that collision and resulting citation in light of Boudreaux's apparent intoxication about two hours. Cynthia Medrano, pictured here with her family, was driving Sunday evening with her young son in the passenger seat when police say Boudreaux ran a red light and plowed into her Honda Civic . Doomed: Even though the 6-year-old was buckled in, he suffered fatal injuries and died upon arriving at a hospital . When questioned by police after his arrest, Boudreaux allegedly admitted that he had taken anti-depressants and a drug used to treat addiction to opiates before getting behind the wheel of his pickup truck Sunday afternoon. Blaine Boudreaux, a Catholic school dropout who moved to Houston in his late teens, has recently lost his home security business and allowed his pharmacy technician license to lapse, reported the Chronicle. During his arraignment Wednesday morning, prosecutors revealed that the suspect has multiple outstanding warrants for DUIs in Louisiana. In one case, he also had jumped bail. In light of these facts, his bond was set at $100,000 on each of the three counts, reported the station KTRK. Boudreaux’s arraignment was attended by several members of Joshua Medrano's family who sobbed in court and showed Boudreaux the middle finger. One woman cried out 'I hope you die!' as the suspect clad in an orange jumpsuit was being led out of the courtroom.

"The codpieces used in the hit BBC drama Wolf Hall were too small and should have been double the size, according to an expert. This is one of a number of inaccuracy spotted in the big budget adaptation of Hilary Mantel's books and was said to have been done so as not to offend and baffle the shows American audience. Victoria Miller, who has researched the codpiece for her PHD, said those used in the show would have been far too modest for Henry VIII's court. Damien Lewis, pictured left, with a small and modest codpiece, and a Renaissance portrait, right, with a much more noticeable and prominent garment . Homeland star Damian Lewis played Henry VIII in the six-part series on the rapid rise to power of Sir Thomas Cromwell in King Henry's court . 'They're way too small to be accurate – they should be at least double the size,' said the Cambridge academic, according to the Guardian. 'You can kind of see them there, but they aren't really stuffed, and are easily missed – they've really toned them down for a mainstream audience. 'The codpiece was meant to draw the eye to the general region.' Mark Rylance, who played Thomas Cromwell, blamed there diminutive size on a 'directive from our American producers'. 'I wasn't personally disappointed by the codpieces: I'm a little more used to them than other people from being at the Globe for ten years,' Rylance said, according to the Daily Telegraph. 'But I can see for modern audiences, perhaps more in America, they may not know exactly what's going on down there.' In the time of Henry VIII the codpiece was a fashion accessory, which was said to be a symbol of a Tudor man's 'virility'. Damian Lewis, who played Henry VIII, admitted that the codpieces were a source of some 'giggling'  during filming. This is not the first time that the show has come under fire for historical errors. When it first aired, historians criticised the decision to cast Kate Phillips as Henry VIII's third wife Jayne Seymour because she was too pretty. Seymour seen in a portrait by Tudor artist Hans Holbein, is depicted with a noticeably large forehead, double chin, and thin pursed lips. According to Lucy Worsley, 41, chief curator at Historic Royal Palaces, Miss Phillips, 25, has features which are too dainty. Miss Worsley said: 'She's too pretty. I did challenge Peter Kosminsky [the director] about that. He laughed and said, ""I picked her because of her acting, not because of her forehead"".' Historians also pointed out that Montacute House in Somerset, which was used to portray Greenwich Palace, is from the Elizabethan period. Historian Lucy Worsley has  said that Kate Phillips, pictured left, who plays Henry VIII's wife Jane Seymour, portrait pictured right, in BBC drama Wolf Hall is too pretty . Miss Worsley has previously questioned the authenticity of some aspects of the programme, claiming both the original books and now this adaptation have brought the characters firmly into the modern day. She said: 'What Hilary Mantel has done is made these characters people for our times, which is interesting for a historian to watch. They are immensely modern, they won't be saying thee and thou and being all dramatic and over the top. 'I think it will make people think the Tudors were just like us in many ways. That's a massive historical question, in some ways they were and in some ways they weren't.' The programme-makers have revealed the lengths they have gone to to ensure historical accuracy – including an unexpected insistence on straight, white teeth and pristine linen. Mantel said a Tudor drama would be less accurate had it insisted on blackened teeth and filthy courtiers – as it was a time when sugar was yet to become widely available.","Cambridge academic Victoria Miller has been researching the codpiece .

"When Fiorentina's season ends next month, Micah Richards won't be jetting off on his summer holidays. For the moment, summer is cancelled for the defender - at least until he knows where he'll be playing next season. His contract at Manchester City expires at the end of the season, when he becomes a free agent. The next few months will be vital in determining whether Richards can resurrect his once burgeoning career. Micah Richards has found playing time hard to come by during his loan move to Italian side Fiorentina . Richards joined the Serie A side after being frozen out at City - and will be on the move again this summer . He knows it, too, choosing to delay any holidays until his next destination is finalised. Likewise, he's taken the decision to change representation, striking an agreement with Wasserman Media Group - the firm that look after Steven Gerrard. His season-long loan in Florence hasn't been a disaster, but you can hardly call it an overwhelming success. Unable to hold down a regular place in Vincenzo Montella's starting XI this season, Richards has had ample time to reflect on his career so far. Tipped as the future of England's defence, Richards' career has been on steady decline. But at the age of 26-year-old, there's time for Richards to buck that recent trend. Richards celebrates with Yaya Toure and Gael Clichy at his boyhood club, where his contract ends this year . Ricahrds is set on a return to the Premier League, shown here in 2011 skipping past Arsenal's Gervinho . He's enjoyed his time in Italy; he likes the lifestyle. But the defender is almost certain that he wants to return to the Premier League ahead of next season. Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini would sign Richards in a heartbeat. He tried, and failed, to sign him on loan in January. The possibility of a permanent reunion with Mancini, who nurtured Richards' career at Manchester City, this summer is a real one for the defender. But the drive to prove he can still be a force in England is strong. Richards has unfinished business on these shores. Richards will not be short of suitors. Aston Villa, Southampton, Everton and West Ham are showing an interest. On paper, a move for Richards this summer is a no brainer. A Premier League winner, close to 200 top-flight appearances under his belt, still only 26 and available on a free transfer. The Birmingham-born 26 year old was England's first choice right-back as a youngster . You don't get many of those to the pound. The pound, though, isn't something Richards will be too concerned with this summer. Talk to those close to the defender, they'll tell you he simply wants to get back to playing regular football - not once every two or three weeks. Richards, who is currently nursing a slight ankle injury, wants to be a mainstay at his next club - and that will be the determining factor when he makes his decision. His versatility is also likely to be a major selling point. We know Richards as a right-back - but he's developed a penchant for playing as a central defender in recent seasons. Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood is willing to offer the former England man a place at the heart of his defence . And it is at centre-back where Richards sees his long-term career. Sportsmail understands Tim Sherwood would be willing to offer Richards a slot in the heart of his defence next season in an attempt to lure him to Villa Park. But, more than anything else, Richards knows he has to play. Prestige will have nothing to do with his next move. If offered the chance of playing a peripheral role for a high-profile club or a regular position elsewhere, he'll choose the latter. The sooner he makes his decision, the sooner he can get on with booking his summer holidays.","Micah Richards' Manchester City contract ends this summer .

"A young Australian rugby player has died following a freak accident during a match in which he hit his head against an opponent's shoulder. Nicholas Tooth, 25, was playing for the Quirindi Lions against the Narrabri Blue Boars in mid-north NSW on Saturday when he collapsed after hitting his head on an opponent's shoulder during a tackle. He was treated at the ground before being airlifted to Newcastle's John Hunter Hospital in a critical condition but died in hospital late on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Nicholas Tooth, 25, died after sustaining a head injury when he hit his head on an opponent's shoulder in a tackle during a first grade rugby union match on Saturday . The young man was visiting his hometown in the New England region of NSW for the weekend . 'Nick went in to tackle an opponent and his head clashed with the shoulder and he went down,' Quirindi Lions club president Charles Murray told the ABC. 'There was no foul play, nothing untoward about it at all. Sadly it was just a very tragic accident.' Originally from Wallabadah in the New England region of NSW, Mr Tooth, who had been working in the agricultural grain industry, was visiting his home town for the weekend. The young man had been living in Sydney while studying at Sydney University, and tributes have since poured in for the 25-year-old. Australian Rugby Union chief executive Bill Pulver told Daily Mail Australia in a statement that the loss of Mr Tooth was 'incredibly sad'.

"Paige VanZant and Felice Herrig had to be pulled apart as they squared off ahead of their strawweight clash in New Jersey. VanZant, at only 21 and with just five fights behind her, has already ruffled feathers after being one of a select few to sign an individual contract with Reebok. And Herrig was clearly riled during the traditional staredown in Times Square. Felice Herrig and Paige VanZant face off during the  weigh-in . Herrig and VanZant will face each other in the Octagon on Saturday night . VanZant steps on the scale during the UFC Fight Night weigh-in event at the Prudential Center . VanZant fights for the second time under the UFC banner when she takes on Felice Herrig . VanZant and Herrig had to be separated after getting too close during the traditional staredown . At 21, VanZant has been hyped as the UFC's next big thing despite only having fought five times . She said: 'I think I'm a better striker than Paige, a better grappler than Paige, I have a better submission skill set than Paige, I'm stronger than Paige and more athletic than Paige so I believe I'll be able to take the fight wherever I want to. 'I'm glad Paige has a lot of hype around her because I feel when I beat her it will make the victory that much sweeter and feel that much more rewarding and it will make people respect me more.' At only 21 and with just five professional fights to her name, VanZant has enjoyed a spectacular rise since her first bout in 2012. After three wins and a decision defeat, she was signed by the UFC for the newly-formed 115lb division and initially selected to appear on the Ultimate Fighter. But due to her being under 21 at the time, she was unable to take part and instead made her debut against Kailin Curran last November, stopping the 24-year-old in the third and final round. 'It's very surreal,' VanZant said. 'Even the fact I'm part of the UFC is a huge experience. It's a blessing and I don't think it will set in for a very long time. VanZant admitted it feels surreal to be part of the UFC having made her debut aged 20 . VanZant works out in the week of her next fight, against Herrig in New Jersey on Saturday night . VanZant made a winning start to her UFC career, stopping Kailin Curran in the third round . 'We were backstage at one of the other weigh-ins and someone threw it out, would you fight Felice Herrig and I said yeah and took the fight right away. 'I'm very excited about the match-up, stylistically it's a good one for me. 'As of right now, the only thing on my mind is winning this fight. I hope to win every fight the UFC offers me and see where this crazy journey can take me'. VanZant has a realistic chance of becoming the UFC's youngest-ever champion. That record belongs to light-heavyweight Jon Jones who won the title in 2011 aged 23. 'Obviously, that would be huge, and that would be awesome; I try not to think about it and try not to focus on setting records,' she told MMAjunkie. 'I strictly want to beat every opponent I face whether it's for a title or for a small show. The only thing for me is winning my fights and being the best athlete I can be.'

"After weeks of being hounded  for a comment on the expected birth of the new royal baby, Mel Greig has written an open letter to the media, warning of the harmful consequences of always seeking for a new angle on world events. The former 2Day FM co-host, who shot to notoriety in 2012 after a prank call during the Duchess of Cambridge's first pregnancy resulted in the death of the nurse who took the call, penned the letter to ask the media, 'Have we not learnt enough from the royal prank call?'. The 33-year-old said in the letter that with the impending birth of the second child for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, she understood the pressure of needing to find 'a new angle' when providing coverage of news events, offering assurance that she had been in the same position. Scroll down for video . Former Australian radio host Mel Greig has written an open letter to the media, warning of the harmful consequences of always seeking for a new angle on world events . 'I sat there and agreed to prank call a hospital to create a “unique angle” a harmless and stupid idea that sadly ended in tragedy, as we felt obliged to cover the pregnancy and to do it differently,' she wrote in the letter published by The Daily Telegraph. The Duchess of Cambridge is believed to be overdue by five days as she had been due to give birth last Thursday . Greig and fellow 2Day FM co-host Michael Christian posed as the Queen and Prince Charles as part of the prank in 2012 to gain information about the Duchess of Cambridge following the birth of Prince George. Jacintha Saldana was the nurse who took the call at King Edward Hospital in London, taking her life two days later and blaming her decision on the actions of the Australian radio hosts. Greig has since revealed her personal torment over the prank, and was unable to return to her role on the air, saying earlier in the year that she felt 'the world hated [her]' for what had happened. In the letter, Greig asks why the media continues to seek fresh angles for stories after seeing the consequences of her mistake, and asks various media outlets to learn from the tragedy of Ms Saldana's death and to be sensible when it comes to covering the birth of the second royal baby. 'Respect their privacy, stay away from the hospital and think of others when working out what angles to pursue. For anyone that is actually considering trying to repeat our stupidity from 2012, DON’T,' Greig wrote. She declared in the letter that there was no need for a fresh angle on the birth, as the fact that a new baby was being born was sufficient, and that her only response would be to congratulate the parents. The Duchess of Cambridge is believed to be five days overdue, and many fans and media have camped outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where she will give birth. The 33-year-old said that while she thought the media industry was 'wonderful', she said that there needs to be a 'line' that is never crossed when reporting news. Greig goes on to recount the moment when her own family was hounded by someone she knew when her father and her whole street was 'doorknocked' for information following the scandal in 2012. 'I’ve crossed the line too. But the difference is, I’ve learnt from it and I’ll continue to work in the media so I can help others to think before they act. You don’t need to be careless to create great content,' she finished. Jacintha Saldana committed suicide two days after taking the prank call and blamed the radio hosts .

The Duchess of Cambridge's royal’s baby is expected before the end of April - with the due date initially reported as yesterday, but later claimed to actually be as early as Wednesday last week. Either way Kate - who plans to give birth at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London - is now overdue and may have already spoken to doctors about the possibility of being induced. Earlier in the year, Greig spoke to BBC2 Radio and spoke of her continual anguish over her actions in 2012. 'I was in disgust with myself, I had failed as a human being, to be involved in someone's death is horrific and it affected me greatly,' she told BBC2 Radio listeners. While Ms Greig said that she now understands that 'there is more to mental health...it's not normally an event like that that can trigger someone to commit suicide,' she experienced overwhelming guilt at the time. Ms Greig said she had experienced deep depression for a year, and claimed that the event had changed her life permanently. Last year, Ms Greig said that she believed the incident would stay with her forever, but that she has done all she can do now that she has personally apologised to her family.

The new royal baby's big brother Prince George was three days overdue when he was born on July 22, 2013 . 'I don’t know how you completely forgive yourself – someone wrote my name in their suicide note,' she told Sunrise. 'They thought of me before they took their own life and that will stay with me forever but I can move forward from that point I think because I've tried to say sorry.' 'It was really tough but I made that promise to them over a year ago that if they wanted answers I would go to the inquest so I was always going to go,' she said. 'To be able to to look them in the eye and say sorry was incredibly hard but it’s something I felt I needed to do – everyone was very emotionally involved in that room.' Ms Greig now hopes she can try to move on with her life. 'I do have a little bit more closure and I’ve been finding it so hard to move forward and I think a lot of that had a lot to do with not being able to say sorry – just bearing that guilt and that blame,' she said. 'To know that I have done everything I can – I tried to help – I said sorry – I feel that I've redeemed myself as much as I can and I hope they got the answers to find the closure as well.'

Ms Greig said that the incident had changed her forever and that she felt like the 'world hated [her]' When asked how others involved in the prank had been able to put the tragedy behind them, Ms Greig simply replied that people handle situations differently. 'Some people were able to just move on from that – I wasn’t – it deeply affected me for a long time and when you are the face of blame publicly you believe it,' she said. 'As well, knowing Jacintha herself has written my name in that suicide note and blamed me directly – you hold yourself responsible.' Ms Greig spoke of how the incident had taken its toll on her over the past two and a half years. 'It took every bit of strength and every bit of support to get through that but you have a choice you can keep fighting or you can let it just take you over and I wanted to fight - life is so precious,' she said. 'I wanted to try to get better and a part of that was going to the inquest and saying sorry and helping the family out so combined I feel I’ve got everything so I can truly move forward.'","Former 2Day FM host Mel Greig penned an open note to the media .

"The possession police are out in force, and Jose Mourinho is the Premier League’s Most Wanted. The football purists are foaming at the mouth – how can this Portuguese pretender dare to win games without wanting the football? Is this the most negative side to ever win the title? Is this the most terrible team to lift the Champions’ crown? Woah there, just hang on a moment. Jose Mourinho has come under fire for Chelsea's lack of possession during their 1-0 win over Man United . Mourinho and his staff and players celebrate the crucial win over United on Saturday at Stamford Bridge . I’m no fan of the kind of football Chelsea played on Saturday to beat Manchester United. But at the end of the season, they are getting the job done, it’s as simple as that. And who can blame Mourinho for being so cautious? Last season they were seven points clear at the top of the table but fell away after losing at Aston Villa and Crystal Palace – both in the bottom half of the table at the time, and were beaten at home by Sunderland, who were six points adrift in 20th place. And then needing a win to go top of the Premier League with just two games to go, Mourinho watched his side draw 0-0 at home to Norwich, who were about to be relegated. The title that had been in their grasp, was lost. Chelsea’s most impressive result during that run-in was a 2-0 win at Liverpool, a game made famous by Steven Gerrard’s slip. It ended Liverpool’s 16-match unbeaten run and checked their charge to the title. That day Chelsea let Liverpool have 73 per cent possession over the 90 minutes. Chelsea found a way to win without the ball. And Mourinho did the same on Saturday to an in-form Manchester United, who had 70 per cent possession at Stamford Bridge. It’s not my kind of football – I like to see what talented professional players can do with the ball. And so does Louis van Gaal. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1-0 by Chelsea . Steven Gerrard slips against Chelsea at Anfield last season - a game Chelsea won with only 17% possession . Ba scores as Chelsea go on to win at Anfield and effectively end Liverpool's title push last season . The Dutch master might just wonder to himself if things could have been different if he had certain individuals fit. All clubs have injuries, but for that massive game on Saturday, United needed key players in the team. It would have been fascinating to see if Van Gaal’s possession philosophy would have won the day, over the Jose way. Chelsea won the game, and they did it in typical Mourinho fashion – by not wanting possession of the football. Jose has learned a lot from his mistakes of last season. I understand his pragmatism given that Chelsea are so close to sealing the title. But he fell into this negativity way too early in the season, and it led to their abject failure in Europe. Mourinho needs to be more expansive in the Champions League next season – that’s for sure. Andre Schurrle’s goal against Burnley after a sublime pass from Cesc Fabregas was a highlight of the season . But don’t judge this Chelsea side on the Premier League run-in alone: they may not have been consistently sparkling with their style, but they have had some wonderful moments this season. On day one of the season Cesc Fabregas’ sublime disguised pass for Andre Schurrle’s goal at Burnley had us all out of our seats. It wasn’t his only example of genius since August. When fit, Diego Costa’s strength, movement and finishing have been a joy to watch. And then there’s Eden Hazard. The player Mesut Ozil, Angel di Maria, Samir Nasri and Raheem Sterling and others all dream of being. Yes some of those others have medals, but they haven’t shown the same amazing ability as the Chelsea number 10. His balance, his control, his passing and finishing have all been superb all season. Chelsea forward Eden Hazard (left) dribbles with the ball ahead of Manchester Untied's Wayne Rooney (right) Oscar (second left) scores against Swansea as Chelsea run riot at the Liberty Stadium in January . And during this period when Jose Mourinho is being over-cautious, making sure they secure the title they let slip last season, Hazard has lifted the team from a blue sea of negative mediocrity, to one capable of star quality. And back in January, Chelsea gave arguably the best footballing display of the season in the Premier League when they went to Swansea and won 5-0. The one-touch football was special, and the way the three behind Costa drifted around was reminiscent of the total football played by sides born out of Rinus Michels’ Ajax and Holland sides of the 1970s. Chelsea were 4-0 in front at the break, by which time Willian had also hit the bar twice. Jose’s side completely outplayed and outpassed one of the better footballing sides in the division. So don’t be too harsh on Chelsea, on their way to the title it’s hell to watch them right now. But Mourinho’s men have taken us to heaven enough times this season to keep the critics off their backs.","Jose Mourinho under fire after Chelsea only have 30 per cent possession in Saturday's 1-0 win over Manchester United at Stamford Bridge .

"I conducted a poll on my radio show recently, and more than 70 per cent of those who voted believe Manchester United will win the title next season. Is it heart ruling the head among the United faithful? Or is there a genuine belief that serial winner Louis van Gaal is about to re-assert himself at the very top again? Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1-0 by Chelsea . Van Gaal poses for pictures with United fans at the training ground during a day for the club's foundation . Van Gaal (pictured talking to fans) is starting to assert himself at the United after a stuttering start . If he is to take United back to the very top, he’ll need more than Memphis Depay. I’ve already established in this column recently that Van Gaal is a great, and he is a winner. I love the fact he has set himself this huge challenge of resurrecting a fallen giant at the end of his career. The Dutchman knows, however, he will not be judged on his ability to repair the damage done by David Moyes. At the end of his (albeit shorter) Old Trafford stay, his record will need to stand comparison with that of Sir Alex Ferguson. Obviously Van Gaal cannot win the same number of trophies Sir Alex picked up during his 27 year reign, so relatively speaking what does he need to achieve to be considered a success at United? Sir Alex underachieved in Europe: only two Champions League wins in his time – just one more than Liverpool in the same period, and the same number as Jose Mourinho (who won those in significantly fewer years). Van Gaal has also underachieved in this department – his only Champions League win was with Ajax, not Bayern Munich or Barcelona. Van Gaal will be hungry to add to that success which came 20 years ago. He should target Euro success as soon as possible. Domestically, United still don’t quite look like the finished article, despite their impressive run in 2015. But they should at least be challenging for the title next season. So what needs to change for United to reach that level where they are in the mix to win the Premier League and the Champions League? Sir Alex Ferguson celebrates his second Champions League triumph with United in 2008 . Van Gaal celebrates winning the Champions League with Ajax in 1995 - his only triumph in Europe . Keeping David de Gea would be ideal, but Victor Valdes has winning experience and there is a bond between the former Barcelona keeper and the manager after their time together at the Nou Camp. Van Gaal blooded Valdes and then man-managed him superbly. Either keeper is fine, it’s obvious who would be preferred though. United need a quality right back – Nathaniel Clyne has been linked and the Southampton man would be perfect. If Clyne is the right fit, Luke Shaw needs to stay fit. He’s been like a rabbit in the headlights this first season, but he’s dealt with Van Gaal’s brutally honest management style well and put in a fine performance at Chelsea. I’ve said before, Shaw has the potential to be an all-time great at United. At centre half, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling might become the trusted partnership, or wisdom may win the day and United could go and get Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund. He’s a winner and a leader – perfect for United. Luke Shaw (right) has had a difficult start to his United career but impressed against Chelsea . Mats Hummels (left) of Dortmund is a player who has long been linked with a move to United . In midfield, United are strong in my view – Daley Blind and Michael Carrick can fight for that anchor spot, or even play together depending on the opposition. I can’t help thinking that adding another Carrick-type player to the squad might be a wise move for Van Gaal. United fans are seeing the best of Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini in this current period, while Juan Mata and Ashley Young have been big positives this season. Wayne Rooney’s quality and contribution as United captain is never up for debate – for me he should be the closest challenger to Eden Hazard for Player of the Year. Which leaves players like Adnan Januzaj, Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria. Ander Hererra (holding off Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas) has impressed for United in recent weeks . Juan Mata (right) is starting to show his best form after moving from Chelsea last January . Angel di Maria (centre) has struggled this season but to leave him leave would be a massive risk for United . United's on-loan striker Radamel Falcao has struggled for form ever since joining the club last summer . Januzaj has stalled a little bit after bursting onto the scene, but he may yet come good. Van Persie would be brilliant off the bench next season – he’s still capable of scoring important goals. The two South Americans are expensive stellar players, but neither have impressed in their first season in English football. To let both leave would be a gamble – European rivals will pick them up, and if they suddenly re-discover their game, United will look foolish. Keeping both is also a risk, but one worth taking if you add one more world-class attacking player. And that’s why United need to go all out to get Gareth Bale. At times this season United have been so slow in their build up. Bale brings dynamism, goals and energy to a side. He could flourish at United, stepping out of Cristiano Ronaldo’s shadow at Real Madrid. United have already enquired about PSV’s Depay, he has all the skills and end product to be loved at Old Trafford, but United still need that marquee man to humiliate opposing defences at home and abroad. Memphis Depay (left, in action for PSV) is a prime target for United and has the potential to be a great signing . Gareth Bale has the dynamism, goals and energy that United have missed in their side this season . Van Gaal signed a three-year deal. If he wins the Premier League and the Champions League in that time he will be considered a total success at United. It’s a tough ask, but he could win both next season. Given his record of winning titles elsewhere, I certainly wouldn’t rule that out. I suspect the United haters will have to calm themselves down over the next few seasons. Did they really think United would be gone for long?","Man United have shown great promise for the future in recent matches .

"Having presumably grown used to being in the company of one famous Ronaldo, Real Madrid's teen sensation Martin Odegaard on Wednesday appeared to be left starstruck by another. The 16-year-old was pictured with former Brazil international Ronaldo as he paid a visit to the club he spent five years at during his illustrious playing career. Norway international Odegaard took to social media to share the picture of the pair at Real's Valdebebas training complex. Martin Odegaard poses with former Brazil international Ronaldo at the Real Madrid training ground . Odegaard celebrates after scoring for Real Madrid Castilla against Barakaldo in February . Zinedine Zidane (with Odegaard behind him, right) dropped the Norwegian from the Castilla side this month . The young midfielder was clearly in awe of the former World Cup winning striker and simply wrote 'legend' alongside the picture on Instagram. Ronaldo, who scored more than 100 goals for Real and netted an impressive 62 international goals, was visiting his old club ahead of their Champions League quarter-final second-leg clash against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Odegaard opted to join Real Madrid after courting interest from a host of top clubs in Europe, including Manchester United and Liverpool, and signed a long-term £40,000 a week contract with the Champions League winners in January. The former Stromgodset playmaker has trained with Carlo Ancelotti's first team regularly since his arrival, rubbing shoulder's with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. Odegaard is said to be on a different wave length to his Castilla team-mates because he rarely trains with them . The 16-year-old joined Real Madrid for £2.3million in January signing a long-term £40,000 a week contract . But the Norwegian wonderkid has found life tough at the Spanish giants in recent weeks. First team coach in waiting Zinedine Zidane dropped Odegaard from his Castilla side earlier this month after a dramatic downturn in results since his arrival. There have been suggestions that his presence in the side has riled team-mates that feel Odegaard training with the first team three times a week means he lacks cohesion in the B team. Real Madrid are desperate for the Castilla side to win promotion to the second tier of Spanish football and Zidane has to decide whether that goal is more attainable without the young talent.","Brazilian Ronaldo paid a visit to former club Real Madrid on Wednesday .

"A 30-year-old Scouser released by Shrewsbury and Tranmere in recent years was the hero of Scottish football at the weekend. Full back David Raven stabbed home the winner to take Inverness Caledonian Thistle to the Scottish Cup final. You can only be pleased for him – he must have thought his career glory had been and gone when he made a few appearances in the Liverpool first team as a youngster (he played in the infamous 1-0 defeat for Rafa Benitez's Reds at Burnley in 2005 – Djimi Traore's silky back-heeled own goal deciding the game). It's a fantastic moment for Raven, good luck to him in the final. But what can we deduce about the state of Scottish football from the two Hampden Park semi-finals last weekend? David Raven peels away after scoring the winner for Inverness against Celtic in the Scottish Cup semi-final . Raven celebrates with team-mate Ryan Christie as Inverness knocked Celtic out at Hampden . Well with Scotland's top club, Celtic, taking the decision to embarrass themselves publicly by writing to the SFA crying about a penalty they weren't awarded against Inverness, you can see there are problems. I interviewed goal hero Raven and he seemed upset by Celtic's actions: 'For a club that size to write to the SFA is a bit much, it's definitely taken the gloss off it a little bit for me. I'm surprised a club like Celtic have done that – it's a bit of an error of judgment for me. I don't know what they're hoping to get out of it,' he told me. Well done Celtic, your extreme arrogance managed to spoil the highlight of an honest pro's career. You should be ashamed of themselves. Celtic think they are so gigantic they have a divine right to get to the final. Apparently only they can make themselves the victims of bad decisions from officials. Celtic are like the brat of a child, over-indulged by parents, and scoffing too many sweets and not sharing any with the other kids because of some superiority complex which isn't backed up by what's actually going on. And the mismanagement of the Scottish game has left it imbalanced and unattractive. Whichever way you look at it, Scottish football, like an unsafe, stinking high rise on the wrong side of Glasgow, needs wiping out and starting again. Firstly, Celtic need bringing down a peg or two. There is nothing to suggest they are bigger than the game of football, yet they act like they are lords and masters of all around them. Celtic didn't get a penalty – so what? Inverness should have had one when sub keeper Lukasz Zaluska bulldozed into the back of an opponent. As bad losers go, Celtic are just about the worst of the lot. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths complained: 'We were robbed.' The whole of football is laughing in his face! Imagine how Rangers fans felt when the authorities banished their club to the brink of non-league football. Now that's being robbed. None of this reflects well on Scottish football. Josh Meekings (centre) appeared to handle the ball in the box but no penalty was awarded to Celtic . Kris Commons appeals for a penalty after Meeking's apparent hand ball but it was to no avail . Celtic captain Scott Brown appeals to referee Steve McLean - the club have since written to the SFA . Next the game north of the border must do more to attract supporters to matches. For Saturday's game between Hibs and Falkirk there were 30,000 empty seats, while nearly 25,000 were missing for Sunday's tie. Two showpiece games at the country's national stadium should be getting close to sell-out crowds. The two biggest clubs in the country – Celtic and Rangers - regularly have loads of empty seats at home games. Where is the passion for football in Scotland? Has it disappeared completely? Was it the curling craze that did it? Have Rhona Martin and all curlers since the Olympic gold medallist hit her peak become the new heroes rather than iron bruisers like Scott Brown? What about on the pitch: take a look at the three Inverness scorers on Sunday: Raven I've told you about; Greg Tansey I first saw when he was a teenager at Stockport and I was impressed. His career since then has levelled out. He's a good technician, but having been allowed to leave Stevenage last year when they were bottom of League One you'd have to question his all-round ability. And Edward Ofere scored a cracker at Hampden, finding the net for the second successive weekend. But this is a 29-year-old Nigerian striker who has yet to play a competitive international game and has had a Nomadic footballing existence thumbing his way around the minor European leagues so far. It's a great moment for these players and for Inverness, but let's not confuse that with anything remotely resembling high quality football. These are journeymen who have worked hard to earn their big day out. James Dunne was a cup winner in Scotland with St Johnstone last season, this year he's been picking up yellow cards in the bottom half of League Two with Portsmouth. Large swathes of Hampden were empty for both Scottish Cup semi-finals over the weekend . The standard of Scottish football has continued to fall and the game needs to be overhauled . Inverness manager John Hughes, sacked by Hartlepool after relegation to League Two less than two years ago, has moulded these players into a side that sits third in the Scottish Premiership table, and favourites to win the Scottish Cup final. In some ways you have to be impressed, and the Caley fans are loving it right now of course. But the standard is not high, and that's not healthy for Scottish football. With the quality on the pitch lacking, it's no surprise the fans can't be bothered to pay and watch. You sign English League Two players and you'll get League Two crowds. What's needed is a total restructuring: a bigger top division in Scotland for a start. That would ensure the biggest clubs have the best chance of staying there, and it would mean the clubs play each other only twice a season in the league – familiarity has bred boredom with a smaller Scottish Premiership. Beyond the top flight, establish only one division with strict criteria for stadia and salary capping. That way clubs are less likely to suffer financial crisis, but standards are maintained, and the focus is on quality in those top two divisions, rather than the current situation where resources spread far too thinly over four leagues. Somehow a fairer distribution of wealth is needed in Scotland. Pumping all the money into Celtic hasn't led to any success in Europe – in fact Celtic have got worse. So spread the money more evenly, generate competition, and maybe that way Scotland can become strong again. It's not all bad - Falkirk's matchwinner on Saturday Craig Sibbald looks like a decent footballer, yet he can't get in the Scotland Under 21 squad. There are some promising young Scottish players around right now, no doubt about that. But overall Scottish football is in a bad way right now. It's in need of major surgery. Celtic's pathetic letter should fire the SFA into action.

"The police van in which Freddie Gray supposedly sustained his fatal injuries does not come with a bolt sticking out from the back door, Chevrolet has confirmed. Designs from the car maker show that the Chevrolet Express - the vehicle used by the Baltimore Police Department - is smooth on the inside of both cage doors. Chevrolet spokesman Michael Albano confirmed to Daily Mail Online that the standard issue Chevrolet Express Police Transport Van has bolts that are built into the door and don't stick out. Mr Albano said that law enforcement agencies are known to customise their own vehicles and that the Baltimore Police Department may have done so to their fleet. The development raises a number of questions about the official account put out by the force which emerged today in a report of its internal investigation into Gray's death. Scroll down for video . Standard-issue: Pictured above is the Chevrolet Express police van, the vehicle used by Baltimore Police to move around prisoners . No bolts? The design of the standard van does not seem to show anything for Gray to have hit his head on . Smooth: This photograph from earlier in the week shows a Baltimore Police version of the van, which also appears to have no bolts protruding, such as those referenced in a medical report on Gray's death . Inside: This is what the Baltimore van looks like inside - Gray was held in the right-hand side . According to the latest police press conference, these are the stops the van made transporting Freddie Gray . And if the Baltimore Police department has customized its vehicles in an unsafe way, they could open themselves up to lawsuits from civil liberties lawyers. In their report ABC News said that there was 'no evidence' Gray sustained a fatal spine injury during his arrest, which was caught on camera on a street side on April 12. Instead he supposedly broke his neck after falling head-first whilst being transported in one of the Baltimore Police vans, a Chevrolet Express. Gray's 'catastrophic' head injuries were consistent with hitting a bolt 'in the back door of the van', the report said. Fatal fall? The van is pictured above during a previously-undisclosed stop . Dead: Gray is pictured above being arrested by Baltimore officers on the day he severed his spine in custody . According to ABC's sources Gray was standing in the van and was bent over with his hand cuffed behind his back and his head pointing towards the back door. But a review of official diagrams of the Chevrolet Express Police Transport Van by Daily Mail Online raises a number of issues with this. The picture of the vehicle on the cargo specifications shows the two sets of bolts at the very top and very bottom of the door. This means that even if they had stuck out, Gray would have had to have either been thrown 5ft into the air or have his head right on the floor in order for him to have been hurt. The catalog for the van shows a picture from another angle and makes clear that the only things on the back door are a grille to let air in and the door itself - with no bolt sticking out. A picture taken by the Associated Press of the van in which Gray was carried shows that the right hand side door is smooth and does not have a bolt sticking out of it. The left side is not visible. Not on us: A Chevrolet spokesman told Daily Mail Online that their vans don't include protruding bolts - but left open the possibility that Baltimore Police modified their vehicle . Chevrolet routinely modifies a number of its vehicles for law enforcement use, a lucrative market for the company. They have proved popular with the public too and the Chevrolet Express is the same vehicle used by Hillary Clinton as her ‘Scooby Van’ on the Presidential campaign trail. The brochure for the Chevrolet Express Police Transport Van states that it ‘delivers on a grand scale’ and that it seats up to 15 people, including prisoners. There are frontal airbags and head curtain side-impact air bags but only for the front three rows which would be occupied by police. According to Chevrolet, which is owned by General Motors, the vehicle is the ‘unmatched capability you need on the job’. Daily Mail Online has approached the Baltimore Police Department for comment.","Medical examiner's report described how Gray may have injured neck .

"They say every cloud has a silver lining, but not every cloud has an outline like this one.

"Tastes change, of course, but looking at some of the adverts that graced newspapers and magazines in the latter half of the 20th century, it's hard to believe that the advertising brains behind them thought they might actually work. If the ad world's top gunslingers now rely on more modern methods of reaching their audience including hopping across multiple media platforms to reach them, once it was all about a single, thoughtfully-composed image. We've unearthed some of the more comical adverts that were regularly placed in the nation's national newspapers or glossy magazines, all of which hoped to persuade shoppers to part with their hard-earned cash. With wide collars, precision-cut suits and intense expressions, the men in the ads have something of the Don Draper from hit series Mad Men about them...albeit with a decade added on. Scroll down for video . Somebody call the fashion police...although this man's terrible jumper, seen in an advert for Seagram's Extra Dry Gin doesn't seem to have put off the lady holding said alcohol . Could the crease on those trousers be any straighter? An advert for DAKS trousers is a vision of beige, caramel and brown . A tan, blond moustache and a pair of curtains...although this ad fails to notice that the man in the photo isn't actually 'dark', the ad brains behind it are clearly convinced it will sell more Dubonnet, a wine-based aperitif . Like a time capsule from the era, the fashions are perfectly preserved; the men generally seem to be sporting thick moustaches (that many a modern-day hipster might covert) and almost always on their arm is an attractive lady, usually not wearing a great deal. An advert for Seagram's Extra Dry Martini Gin shows a couple sharing a tender moment, the lady caressing a glass of said gin while her partner looks on lovingly, stroking her cheek all the while. While the woman in question is wearing a low-cut top, it's the man in the image that really steals the show; he's wearing a checked shirt with very pointy collar and on top of it a jumper with a pattern that might induce a headache. The look is topped off with a pair of cream trousers, complete with perfectly pressed creases. Enjoy the great outdoors and then relax with a drink (while wearing a nice sweater) seems to be the general message from advertisers in the seventies . The machismo never ends: moustachioed men are seen advertising brands of scotch and whisky . Looking cool! In a 1969 advert for Marks and Spencer, these three dapper chaps are all set for the golf course . Another direct link between physical fitness and alcohol...this time for White Horse Scotch Whiskey. This 1979 ad in Now magazine showed a lean basketball player and a beautiful white horse . A collision of colour: Singer Rod Stewart once advertised Kickers shoes...while wearing some very garish clothes . A dig at the feminists: This advert suggests that drinking vodka might cause a woman to disrobe . Flicking through magazines from the same era, it's hard to distinguish between the male models; they are uniformly brunette with a moustache whether they're advertising Catto's Scotch or Smooth Canadian whisky. Another ad for DAKS trousers, which featured in a magazine in 1975, shows a couple wearing more clothes - this time they're a vision of beige, caramel and brown in tweed jackets. While the lady sports a pleated skirt, the gentleman has a pair of the brand's 'Signature' trousers, which appear to brush the ankle bone and have a very sharp crease mark running up them. Ding dong: These adverts for cosmetics company Avon appeared in the 1960s and show the more elegant female fashions of the era . Very, very successful sweater wearing...if you didn't know how to achieve that, this earlier advert from Lux in 1962 would show you how . There seems to be a large association between alcohol, sport and attractiveness with many of the ads featuring their main protagonist is two poses; 'active' and 'relaxing' afterwards with a glass of something delicious. Occasionally, there is a different face in the mix, one that belongs to a famous person. Take Rod Stewart's colourful ad for footwear brand Kickers. The Scottish crooner, with his trademark spiky hair, can be seen in one ad reclining on a beige sofa, wearing clothes that might hurt somebody's eyes. Skin-tight emerald velour green trousers are teamed with a stripy red, yellow, blue and black knitted jumper. There's a matching pair of leg warmers and a red scarf. The Kickers boots are bright red. Vodka giant Smirnoff teased an audience of feminists with its ad which showed a woman wearing a low-cut dress and the strapline: 'I never even thought of burning my bra until I discovered Smirnoff.' What would the Avon ladies, who appeared in ads throughout the 1960s wearing more demure twin-sets and pearls, make of it all?","Magazine ads from the Seventies haven't stood the test of time .

"Violent protesters in Baltimore, Maryland injured several police officers on Monday, throwing bricks and rocks at the overwhelmed cops hiding behind riot armor.

"What Jason Holder did in Antigua and Marlon Samuels managed here will do much for the culture Phil Simmons is trying to create as new West Indies coach. They will inspire their team-mates with their discipline, character and application, just as Mike Atherton inspired me with the way he batted to save a Test in Johannesburg and in his famous battle with Allan Donald at Trent Bridge. This is an era in which West Indies are losing players to the easier option of the Indian Premier League and it is understandable because of the money that can be made there. Why shouldn’t they cash in? Marlon Samuels (right)  celebrates reaching his century for West Indies in second Test . But Samuels has taken the difficult road. It is all well and good going off and having a bit of a hit and giggle but he will take a lot more satisfaction from the way he has taken on the moving ball in a demanding Test match. These are the types of innings you remember when you retire. He will remember his duel with Ben Stokes, the way he saw off a newish ball and how he took the attack to England on the first evening. He did finally fall to Jimmy Anderson after a loose shot but by that time Samuels had grafted his way to 103. That is what you get in Test cricket. This is far harder than going off towards the end of your career and enjoying an IPL sunset. I never played in an easy Test. There is no easy option during five hard-fought days and that’s why this game gives you far more satisfaction than you will ever get over 50 or 20 overs. It gets me down to hear people saying ‘wasn’t Antigua boring’ or ‘these pitches are just too dead and the cricket is slow’. Just give this time. The Test England won in the dark of Karachi was remembered for years because it was the ultimate conclusion to three hard Tests. The same could happen here. I can see a lot of our England side of 2000 in this West Indies team. We could not become a winning side straight away. West Indies batsman Samuels grafted his way to 103 against England in the second Test . We had to stay in games, instil a bit of pride and discipline before we could think about being positive and that’s what Simmons is trying to do here. The first step is to take Tests into five days and once that is achieved then West Indies can think about moving on and hopefully keeping their best players. The seven days we have had so far in this series may not have satisfied those who prefer their gratification instant but I have enjoyed it. This is not to denigrate Twenty20 or what we saw at the World Cup but there is something fulfilling about seeing a match go to the fifth day as in Antigua, with England bowling 130 overs and trying to find different ways to take 10 wickets. We live in a modern world of instant news where Test cricket seems something of a throwback but there is still great satisfaction to be taken from a slow burner. Ben Stokes was admonished by umpire Steve Davis following clash with Samuels . I find the mental side of Test cricket to be unparalleled. To be Jonathan Trott, for instance, getting a duck in his first innings after waiting to get back in for 18 months. Then he has to spend the best part of two days fielding and sweating on a pair. You can’t replicate that in any other form of the game. Someone like Alastair Cook has to tackle a technical issue, having been found out by opponents, and has the mental battle to overcome it. There is the physical challenge of a bowling attack spending all that time in the heat trying to bowl a side out and then having to go through it all again. In Twenty20 you can have a bit of a slog, edge through the slips for four to get you off and running and then get caught on the boundary which is supposed to happen in the short game. I thoroughly enjoy the different attractions of limited-overs cricket. But Test cricket is what players will be remembered for. Even in the modern world.","Marlon Samuels will inspire team-mates with discipline and application .

New Zealander Philip Lyle Hansen, 56, has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges, including unlawful sexual connection and charges of wounding with intent to injure four women between 1988 and 2011. On Wednesday a Wellington District Court jury continued hearing evidence from a woman, 47, who was in a relationship with Hansen during the 1990s. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the court she never consented to Hansen pulling out her teeth but was too ‘afraid’ to say anything. Crown prosecutor Sally Carter warned the jury that during the trial they would hear evidence about Hansen's ‘fascination or obsession with them [women] not having any teeth’. New Zealander Philip Lyle Hansen, 56, is accused of removing women’s teeth with pliers and a screwdriver during sex . ‘He liked his women without teeth,’ Ms Carter said in her opening address, the New Zealand Herald reports. The court watched a video form 2012 of the woman talking about how Hansen allegedly held her against a car door and removed six of her bottom teeth, using an oily rag to stop the bleeding, during sex. She later had all her teeth removed and replaced with dentures, but when her wisdom teeth started coming through Hansen allegedly removed them with a screwdriver. ‘He had a screwdriver in his hand, he then tilted my head back... after that he had grabbed the screwdriver and started digging at the back of my gums to try and get out these wisdom teeth,’ she said in the video. A woman, 47, has claimed Hansen 'grabbed the screwdriver and started digging at the back of my gums' During cross-examination defence lawyer Mike Antunovic said the woman had let Hansen pull out six teeth from her lower jaw and that Hansen was just trying to help the women, not hurt them. ‘So after he pulled out the first tooth ... the second tooth, the third tooth, the fourth tooth, the fifth tooth, the sixth tooth ... you didn't ask him to stop?’ said Mr Antunovic. ‘No,’ replied the woman, who said she had been drinking that night but was not heavily intoxicated. The lawyer said the woman had not objected to Hansen extracting her teeth with pliers. ‘You opened your mouth to allow him to put the pliers in,’ said Mr Antunovic. ‘I would not just freely open my mouth to a pair of pliers,’ said the woman. Hansen's lawyer said the woman had not objected to Hansen extracting her teeth with pliers . ‘Well, you didn't shut your mouth. You didn't tell him to stop,’ said the lawyer. The woman told the court she couldn't, saying ‘I had no choice’. Mr Antunovic suggested Hansen had been trying to help the woman when he tried to remove her emerging wisdom teeth with a screwdriver after she complained about the problems they were causing her. ‘Do you think Philip was trying to help you, in his own way?’ he said. ‘Not really, no,’ said the woman. Hansen was arrested in December 2012. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Philip Lyle Hansen, 56, has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges .

"A Libyan rapper has released a new music video in which he is seen seen performing his music in front of dramatic scenes of civil war. Calling himself 'Volcano', the 31-year-old musician was filmed wearing hip hop-style clothing as he stands in front of missile launchers and burning buildings in the conflict-ravaged city of Benghazi. Libya's second largest city was seized by the hardline Islamist group Ansar al-Sharia in July last year and intense fighting between the rebels and regime forces over the past few months have reduced much of Benghazi to rubble - apparently an ideal backdrop to Volcano's rap videos. Scroll down for video . Warzone: Calling himself 'Volcano', the 31-year-old musician was filmed wearing hip hop-style clothing as he stands in front of missile launchers and burning buildings in the conflict-ravaged city of Benghazi . Guns: Rapping in Arabic, Volcano is pictured holding a large assault rifle and surrounded by armed fighters . Vehicle: Volcano stands in front of a pick-up truck that has been modified to carry a massive machine gun . Volcano's video begins by showing him making a phone call in a quiet backstreet but soon cuts to amateur footage of explosions and shots of the rapper performing in front of burning buildings. Rapping in Arabic, Volcano is pictured holding a large assault rifle and standing in front of pick-up trucks that have been modified to carry massive machine guns. Seconds later he and a group of armed militants are seen standing in front of a tank in a heavily shelled courtyard as they pose for the camera while artillery vehicles fire their weapons. At one point Volcano - who wears expensive boots, jeans, a baseball jacket, sunglasses and gold chains - gives the thumbs up to the camera while standing in front of the burning rubble of a destroyed building. Elsewhere in the video the rapper wears military-style fatigues, although his well-groomed beard and spotless white trainers make him stand out among the exhausted fighters wearing bullet-proof vests and battered combat gear. Although he appears in the war zone wielding a guns, it is not clear whether Volcano is simply using the civil war backdrop for effect or if he is actually involved in the conflict. It is also unclear whether the fighters he appears alongside are rebels or members of the Libyan National Army.

It is not clear whether Volcano is using the civil war backdrop for effect, or if he is  involved in the conflict . The most senior member of the Gaddafi clan has laid the blame of the migrant shipwreck that killed about 950 people on the western countries which helped overthrow Colonel Gaddafi. Ahmed Gaddaf al-Dam, a former minister and Muammar Gaddafi's cousin, said the 'overwhelming chaos' in Libya 'has become a shame that will haunt the countries that had participated in the destruction of the Libyan armed forces in 2011'. But senior Conservative minister William Hague has defended the government's role in helping to overthrow the dictator, who was well-known for his barbaric treatment of the would-be migrants. About 800 people are believed to have died when a fishing boat carrying migrants overturned off Libyan waters, south of the Italian island of Lampedusa, shortly after midnight on Sunday. And Gaddafi's cousin, who was one of several high-profile regime figures who fled to Egypt during the 2011 revolution, believes the only solution for stability in the Mediterranean is to bring back those who surrounded the country's despotic former ruler in government. Volcano's Facebook page describes him as a Benghazi-based rapper who also studies English translation at Benghazi University - the oldest education establishment in Libya. The lyrics to his song refer to God being 'gone' and - rather than talking about the conflict in Libya - appear about Palestinians living in Gaza. The refrain of the song suggests Volcano keeps up to date with events in the Gaza Strip and Israel via news on Google and Yahoo. Giving his personal interests as 'Libyan rap', Volcano's page also states: 'I hate treason'. The comment is not elaborated on, and it is not clear exactly what he is referring to. The majority of Volcano's music video is filmed on an  HD camera and he appears to be wearing and large and expensive wristwatch throughout - suggesting he could be considerably wealthier than the average resident in Benghazi. The six-minute clip also ends with Volcano watching the video back on a Samsung mobile phone. Between shots of the rapper standing on war-ravaged streets and posing with gun-wielding fighters, Volcano is seen giving a concert in downtown Benghazi. Although the faces of his audience are not seen, the crowd wave their hands in the air as Volcano stands on a makeshift stage . As well as HD shots of Volcano rapping and posing alongside heavily armed fighters, the footage also shows to clips of daily life in Benghazi - such as a father taking his young son shopping. Elsewhere amateur footage of shell attacks are edited in to the video clip. Calm: Volcano's video begins by showing him making a phone call in a quiet backstreet .

Volcano is not the first North African rapper linked to warfare and conflict. Earlier this year Islamic State supporters took to social media to boast about the recruitment of a failed party loving rapper from Tunisia. Maurouane Douiri, better known by his stage name Emino, announced his decision to join ISIS by posting a picture of himself holding a goat, allegedly in Iraq. Emino appears to have abandoned his trademark ushanka hat and is shown wearing a long red and white Arab scarf. Strangely posed holding a small brown and white goat, the once wannabe gangster wrote that he had given his allegiance to the leader of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Emino was one of a dozen Tunisian rappers who were vocal critics of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's regime. Previously the 25 year old used his social media page to proudly show off photos of himself surrounded with a bevy of scantily clad ladies.

It is unclear whether the fighters Volcano poses with are rebels or members of the Libyan National Army . One of the photos shows the rapper being touched and stroked by a group of women, with one of them appears to be drinking from a suspicious looking wine glass. Emino is no trendsetter - at least three other failed rappers have joined ISIS over the last few years. German rapper Denis Cuspert is the best known of the three known rappers to have been part of Islamic State. Known on stage as Deso Dogg, the wannabe gangster traded in his failing career to embrace the extremist group's radical brand of Islam. American failed rapper Douglas McAuthur McCain was reportedly killed fighting for ISIS last August. McCain, who enjoyed smoking marijuana in the park and had previous convictions for disorderly conduct, is thought to have converted to Islam in 2004.","Calling himself 'Volcano' rapper is a 31-year-old from war-torn Benghazi .

"They are the homes provided  to give those less fortunate members of our society a roof over their heads. But with the cost of maintenance and repairs to damaged public housing nearing $13 million a year in NSW alone, the State Government has had enough and is planning to make tenants pay a bond before they move in. Communities Minister Brad Hazzard said it was a 'very likely possibility' the plan would be implemented in the near future. 'The critical argument for it is that at the moment the maintenance costs, including damage from poor tenancy, are in the order of approximately $12-13 million per year,' Mr Hazzard told Daily Mail Australia. A picture from the NSW Department of Family and Community Services shows damage to public housing . Public housing tenants will  pay a bond under a NSW government plan to recoup losses from trashed properties . The state's new Community Services Minister Brad Hazzard said the annual bill for repairs and maintenance on taxpayer-funded housing had hit $12 million . Mr Hazzard added that he was unsure as to why public housing tenants have never been made to pay a bond similar to that paid by private renters . 'I'd like to see at least a reasonable portion of that money saved and put into more public housing. We have very long public housing tenancy waiting lists.' Mr Hazzard, who took over the portfolio after the March election, said he was alerted to the fact public housing tenants don't pay a bond when consulting with workers in the field. He added that introducing a bond was not a new idea or 'rocket science'. 'My job is to make sure I use taxpayers money very wisely and maximise the opportunities for public housing for other people that wait years,' Mr Hazzard said. The Minister said it would most likely be a one month bond, paid off over six months to a year. He said it would be possible to make exceptions in certain circumstance – for example women escaping domestic violence. Mr Hazzard added public housing tenants were already liable for damage but 'they don't have the money'. Pictured is a trashed public housing property in Hornsby, in the northern suburbs of Sydney . Mr Hazzard, who took over the portfolio after the March election, said he was alerted to the issue when consulting with workers in the field . Damage can also be seen to the garage door, and the backyard is piled up with junk . 'Generally it's very hard to retrospectively try to get money from tenants when they've moved out,' he said. 'This is about sending a forward message, a very clear and upfront message, that you will be responsible for the damage.' Ned Cutcher, policy officer at the NSW Tenants' Union, said public housing tenants were already liable if they caused damage to properties. 'Tenants are always liable for the damage they cause, the question of the bond is really just about making sure there's a little bit of money there so landlords can have ready access to money,' Mr Cutcher said. 'I don't think the government should be looking at that in the same way as private landlord, who might struggle to cover costs. 'The government landlord isn't going to find themselves in a situation where they're going to be short of cash.' Mr Cutcher added that damage was often unfairly attributed to tenants. Green mouldy bread and stacks of filthy dishes seen piling up in the kitchen that hasn't been cleaned . Mr Hazzard said the bond would be able to be paid in instalments. 'They may not have the money to pay it in one hit, that's understandable,' he said . 'Some of those photos indicate something else is going on, properties are being vandalised it's not just people not looking after their properties,' he said. 'Tenants are usually very happy to have a social housing property, something they can afford, and it sure beats homelessness so they'll look after it on the whole. 'Problems occur when properties are left vacant for too long, and that's not an issue that can be solved by hitting tenants up for more money.' Mr Cutcher added: 'Households who are entering social housing tenancy are facing a number of challenges, and one of those challenges is necessarily a financial one. 'And to place an additional financial burden on people under those circumstances should be a difficult decision for a minister to make.' Ned Cutcher, policy officer at the NSW Tenants' Union, said public housing tenants were already liable if they caused damage to properties . Mr Cutcher added that damage was often unfairly attributed to tenants, when houses were sometimes vandalised or left vacant for long periods of time . 'Some of those photos indicate something else is going on, properties are being vandalised it's not just people not looking after their properties,' he said .","Public housing tenants will  pay a bond under a NSW government plan .

"Former Treasurer Peter Costello has fired a damaging salvo at the Abbott government just weeks out from its second budget, describing its approach to taxation as a 'morbid joke'. Ever since the government released his tax discussion paper calling for a 'lower, simpler, fairer' system there has been nothing but suggestions for taxes that are higher, more complicated and less economic, the former Liberal treasurer in an opinion piece in the Daily Telegraph. 'Lower, simpler, fairer is looking like a morbid joke,' Mr Costello said on Tuesday, citing a proposed bank deposit tax and a push for a greater contribution from multinational companies. Peter Costello slammed the Abbott government, describing its approach to taxation as a 'morbid joke' Treasurer Joe Hockey was not impressed with the Costello critique, lamenting the fact his Liberal predecessor had more tax revenue to use during the Howard government years . 'The government needs to restart the conversation about getting taxes down, not up.' He also slams Labor and the Greens, saying using the tax system to re-distribute income would trap Australians in poverty. 'The tax system is there to raise government revenue at the lowest cost in the most efficient way doing the least damage to the economy.' Treasurer Joe Hockey was not impressed with the Costello critique, lamenting the fact his Liberal predecessor had more tax revenue to use during the Howard government years. 'If I had the same revenue as he had, then I'd be getting $25 billion extra each year to spend on things,' he told Sky News from New York, pointing to the abolition of the carbon and mining taxes. 'Everyone's entitled to give free advice and frankly, that's what it's worth - it's free advice. The Abbott government is due to deliver its second budget on May 12 . Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg praised Mr Costello as a 'very distinguished' former treasurer, but said the government had reduced the overall tax take and a small business tax cut was on its way . 'I would suggest that people stop looking back to what it was and focus on the challenges of today and tomorrow, no matter who they are.' Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg praised Mr Costello as a 'very distinguished' former treasurer, but said the government had reduced the overall tax take and a small business tax cut was on its way. The coalition was also having to deal with lower commodity prices than the Howard government enjoyed, he told ABC radio. In an opinion piece, Fairfax economics editor Peter Martin argued that Hockey had inherited economic problems created by  superannuation changes Costello introduced when he was treasurer. Mr Martin labelled 2006 budget changes which saw super payouts become tax free for the majority of Australians aged over 60 as 'stupid' and 'expensive'. He quoted economist Saul Eslake who labelled the change 'one of the worst taxation policy decisions of the past 20 years'.","Peter Costello slammed government pledge for 'lower, simpler, fairer' taxes .

"A holidaymaker still has sickness issues, nine months after he first contracted food poisoning on holiday in Egypt. James Houlder and his girlfriend, Vicki Hood, had saved up for months for the sunshine break at the Sonesta Beach Resort in Sharm El Sheikh. But within just hours of arriving at the First Choice resort, which is described as five-star on its website, the couple say they became violently ill with sickness and diarrhoea and were barely able to leave their room. James Houlder fell ill while on holiday with his partner Vicki Hood last summer at the Sonesta Beach Resort in Sharm El Sheikh, and is still suffering nine months on . James, 30, who works for a publishing company, has since developed Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a digestive complaint which he admits can leave him in crippling pain with him sometimes needing the toilet several times an hour. Vicki, 22, claims she too has been plagued by sickness including a kidney infection. The couple, who live just outside Norwich, had booked the break last summer and envisaged 10 days sunning themselves on the beach and scuba diving in the famous Red Sea. But instead James said: 'On the first night we got there in time for the end of dinner and that's where it all started to go wrong. The next morning, after breakfast, we started to become violently ill. We had to take it in turns to use the bathroom. 'When we finally felt better a few days later we decided to eat at one of the resort's a la carte restaurants. We thought it would be safer than the buffet but it just made us ill all over again. Mr Houlder took a photo of a piece of mouldy bread while he was on holiday in Sharm El Sheikh . 'We were both so ill we were crying. It was dreadful, the worst holiday ever. 'The rooms were dated and dirty and the staff were rude. 'It was like a holiday coming home.' James claims they asked to get earlier return flights but were told it would cost them hundreds of pounds. After investing around £1,500 already in the all-inclusive deal, he says they were forced to sit it out in the blistering heat. And once at home James told how the health problems continued with IBS still causing him to take time off or away from work nine months on. He said: 'It's sporadic, it's not something that happens all the time, but equally it can come on without warning. One minute I'm fine and the next I can be in agony. 'The other day I had to stop twice on the way to work to go to the toilet and it's only a 20-minute drive. 'I've been in situations where I've been going many times an hour and trying to hide it. It's awful and embarrassing.' James says he was offered a £50 'goodwill voucher' but no apology from First Choice and has now instructed law firm Slater and Gordon to launch a civil case against the travel company, part of the TUI Group. A spokesperson for First Choice told MailOnline Travel: 'First Choice is sorry to hear of the couple’s experience during their holiday in Egypt. 'Our ultimate priority is the health, safety and comfort of all our customers and we operate stringent health and hygiene procedures in line with industry standards. 'As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.' The Sonesta Beach Resort in Sharm El Sheikh will provide bad memories for James Houlder . Richard Duxbury, a specialist travel lawyer from Slater and Gordon, representing Mr Houlder, said: 'Mr Houlder and his partner paid a substantial amount of money to go on what they thought would be a relaxing getaway. 'Instead the holiday was ruined by entirely unacceptable hygiene standards which have left both of them still suffering the effects several months after returning home.' MailOnline Travel has also contacted Sonesta Beach Resort, and is awaiting a response. James Houlder says numerous meals at the Sonesta Beach Resort made him and his partner sick . Alex Comley fell ill during a family holiday to the Sonesta Beach Resort in Egypt . EasyJet pilot Alex Comley, 33, from Bracknell, Berks, booked a 10-day break to Sonesta Beach Resort in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt last July with tour operator Thomson Holidays with his wife Louise, 36, and two-year-old son Sebastian. However, the all-inclusive trip, which cost nearly £2,000, was ruined only four days after they arrived when Alex was struck down by Salmonella at their four-star resort. He claims his illness became so serious that after returning home he needed medical treatment and was unable to return to work for EasyJet for more than a month. He said: 'We were all very excited about the trip abroad as it was the first family holiday since my son Sebastian was born. 'We had planned on doing so many 'firsts' and really wanted Sebastian to have a wonderful time on his holiday and enjoy spending some real quality time together as a family. However the holiday turned into a nightmare.' On the fourth day he woke up with crippling stomach pains and was in agony for the rest of the holiday, suffering with vomiting and diarrhoea. 'I have never been so unwell. I couldn't be away from the toilet for any extended periods as I was so ill so I was basically trapped in a hotel room for nearly the entire time. 'I had only eaten in the hotel as it was an all-inclusive holiday, so I must have eaten something there to cause the problems.' An appointment with the doctor on his return home apparently confirmed that he had contracted a serious strain of salmonella food poisoning and couldn't return to his job for more than four weeks. Alex, who says he hasn't received an apology from the firm, has instructed law firm Slater & Gordon to launch a legal case against Thomson Holidays. The case is ongoing. In a statement, Thomson Holidays said: 'We are sorry to hear of Mr Comley's experience during his trip to Egypt. As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further. 'The ultimate priority for Thomson is the health, safety and comfort of all our customers.

"How Neanderthals met their demise remains a long standing mystery for historians. One theory is that early modern humans 'bullied' their Neanderthal cousins to the point of extinction because they had better tools to survive. But a new study of ancient stone tools contradicts this theory by suggesting human weapons were no better than those created by Neanderthals. The researchers studied stone tools that were used by people in the Early Ahmarian culture and the Protoaurignacian culture, living in south and west Europe and west Asia around 40,000 years ago. They found the human tools (pictured) were no more effective than Neanderthal-created tools of the same era . Researchers say the discovery means we may need to rethink the reasons humans survived Neanderthals - and that we may not have behaved as differently as we thought. Traditionally, scientists believed that innovation in weapons enabled humans to spread out of Africa to Europe. But the new study by Nagoya University and the University of Tokyo in Japan argues Neanderthals were just as well-equipped as their human counterparts. 'We're not so special, I don't think we survived Neanderthals simply because of technological competence,' said Dr Seiji Kadowaki, first author of the study from Nagoya University, Japan. On the left is a map of the Levant showing the locations of the Early Ahmarian-related sites analysed in this study. Neanderthals (reconstruction right) may not have been as dim-witted as first believe, claims the study . The Early Ahmarian culture used small stone points as tips for hunting weapons like throwing spears. Researchers previously considered these to be an important innovation - one that helped the humans migrate from west Asia to Europe, where Neanderthals were living . Early modern humans expanded the geographic area they inhabited out of Africa during a period of time 55,000-40,000 years ago. The researchers studied stone tools that were used by people in the Early Ahmarian culture and the Protoaurignacian culture, living in south and west Europe and west Asia around 40,000 years ago. They used small stone points as tips for hunting weapons like throwing spears. Researchers previously considered these to be an important innovation - one that helped the humans migrate from west Asia to Europe, where Neanderthals were living. They are often depicted as dim-witted evolutionary losers, but Neanderthals were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains.. Instead, it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors, scientists believe. An analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years strips away some of the myths surrounding Neanderthals and reveals they were more advanced and sophisticated than has widely been thought. Many researchers believe the differences between the two human species are not enough on their own to account for the demise of the Neanderthals. Neanderthals have been found to make stone tools and even made jewellery. Eight talons taken from a white-tailed eagle found at Neanderthal site in Krapina in Croatia were used to create a necklace or bracelet 130,000 years ago. However, the new research reveals a timeline that doesn't support this theory. If the innovation had led to the migration, evidence would show the stone points moving in the same direction as the humans. But the study showed the possibility that the stone points appeared in Europe 3,000 years earlier than in the Levant, a historical area in west Asia. 'We looked at the basic timeline revealed by similar stone points, and it shows that humans were using them in Europe before they appeared in the Levant - the opposite of what we'd expect if the innovation had led to the humans' migration from Africa to Europe,' said Dr Kadowaki. 'Our new findings mean that the research community now needs to reconsider the assumption that our ancestors moved to Europe and succeeded where Neanderthals failed because of cultural and technological innovations brought from Africa or west Asia.' They believe the timings imply several new scenarios about the migration of modern humans into Europe. For example, they are likely to have migrated to Europe much earlier, and developed the tools there. 'We're very excited about our new model. We think the causes of human evolution are more complicated than just being about technology. 'Now that we've re-examined the traditional model about the northern migration route to Europe, we are planning to re-evaluate the model on the southern migration route - from East Africa to South Asia' said Dr Kadowaki.","Japanese researchers studied ancient stone weapons created by humans .

"The scene looks as though there has been a disaster. In what was likened to a ‘military operation’ a pair of cranes struggle to retrieve a ‘casualty’ from a house, while fire engines, police, a medical team and other officials stand by. The immediate area is screened from the public gaze with tarpaulin. Roads are cordoned off. No traffic can get to nearby schools. For seven hours, there is a state of ‘mayhem’. Yet it was no sudden catastrophic incident, as some witnesses imagined. This was simply what it took to remove a 22-year-old woman who weighs 55st from her home. Scroll down for video . Obese Georgia Davis, 22, who weighs 55 stone, had to be lifted out of her home in Aberdare, south Wales, by a crane so emergency services could take her to hospital . The seven-hour operation involved two cranes, seven police cars, two fire engines and 11 medics . Georgia Davis is an extreme manifestation of the obesity epidemic afflicting young people in Britain. She is 5ft 6in tall but exists on a 13,000-calorie-a-day binge of takeaways and junk food which has rendered her immobile. The source of her income to finance her intake is unclear. ‘Britain’s fattest woman’, as she has been described, eats to excess because she wants to and has done so since the age of five. Periodically, her bloated body can take it no more and she has to be removed to hospital for treatment. That is what happened in the village of Cwmaman, on the edge of Aberdare, on Wednesday. It is the second time in three years the emergency services have been summoned to free her from her self-inflicted prison. On the first occasion they had to demolish part of her parents’ house. Since then she has been given a specially adapted ground-floor flat with French doors opening onto the street. This was to allow easier access for the next inevitable medical emergency. And so it came to pass. Largely bedridden for the past fortnight because of water retention, Georgia developed a ‘severe infection’ which required hospital treatment. But she had become too big and weak to move. Calling the ambulance meant a major logistical operation which must have cost thousands of pounds in manpower and equipment hire . he first crane proved not strong enough to lift the patient. A larger crane had to be summoned which necessitated closing half-a-mile of the main road for an hour . For other individuals, this would at worst have been a question of calling an ambulance. In Georgia’s extraordinary case it meant a major logistical operation which must have cost thousands of pounds in manpower and equipment hire. Her extraction began a little after 9am. Three nurses from the local hospital and a paramedic arrived outside Georgia’s block of flats in a convoy of cars. They were to prepare her for the move. Soon afterwards, the medical team was joined by a fire officer, whose job it was to assess the dimensions and route of the removal. He decided the special French doors would have to be entirely removed. The first police officers and an ambulance arrived at 10am, according to neighbours. At 11.30am, two fire tenders pulled up followed by a mobile crane, an essential piece of equipment when lifting a 55st woman on a reinforced stretcher. At midday, three police cars arrived. They would be joined in the afternoon by another four. One resident reported: ‘It’s absolute chaos, there’s 999 vehicles everywhere and dozens of emergency service workers. All the roads are shut.’ And still the operation had not begun. At 2.30pm, the critical care medical team arrived in an SUV. By the time the first attempt to remove Georgia began an hour later, there were more than a dozen emergency vehicles outside the flats and in the car park at the back. Soon, a serious problem became apparent. The first crane proved not strong enough to lift the patient. A larger crane had to be summoned which necessitated closing half-a-mile of the main road for an hour. By the time it arrived, eyewitnesses estimated the number of specialists in attendance to be as many as 40. You may wonder why and what else was happening elsewhere in South Wales that might have more usefully held their attention. One neighbour said: ‘I thought the flats were on fire, there were so many vehicles. The road was totally blocked, it was absolute mayhem.’ Largely bedridden for the past fortnight because of water retention, Georgia (pictured left and right) developed a ‘severe infection’ which required hospital treatment. But she had become too big and weak to move . Georgia blamed her initial bingeing on ‘comfort eating’ following the death of her father from emphysema when she was little . Georgia was finally removed seven hours after the procedure began. She was taken in a reinforced ambulance to Royal Glamorgan hospital, where she is expected to remain for weeks. It was claimed that she had recently begun eating salads in order to lose weight. But as one neighbour, Anita Coolney, reportedly pointed out: ‘Georgia may be having salads, but she is having takeaways too. I’ve seen them being delivered. What’s the good of having salad for lunch if you have an 18in pizza for tea?’ Another was reported to have said: ‘I can’t eat as much in a week as she eats in a day. It’s disgusting.’ A spokesman for Cwm Taf University Health Board said: ‘We can confirm that the fire service was brought in to assist us with access to a property in order to safely transport a patient into hospital.’ South Wales Police, South Wales Fire and Rescue Service all refused to comment on the cost of the operation. Social landlord RCT homes, which owns Georgia’s flat, also refused to comment. Her mother Lesley, who has weighed as much as 31st, must also take a good deal of the blame. She had fed baby Georgia condensed milk and potatoes instead of baby food . A spokesman for the Welsh Ambulance Service said: ‘We attended a joint operation with colleagues from Cwm Taf University Health Board, South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, the Emergency Medical Retrieval and Transfer Service, and South Wales Police to assist in the transportation of a patient to hospital. ‘This involved nine personnel from Welsh Ambulance Service and two from EMRTS. The operation started with preparation on site at 9.15am and our staff left the scene at 4pm.’ Georgia first came to national attention in 2008 when, aged 15, she had a 64in waist and weighed 33st. She also had Type 2 diabetes. She said: ‘I know it’s partly my fault. But it’s so hard to stop eating. It’s like a drug. Some people choose heroin but I’ve chosen food and it’s killing me. It’s as if I can hear Greggs [the bakers] calling me.’ She blamed her initial bingeing on ‘comfort eating’ following the death of her father from emphysema when she was little. At seven she weighed 11st. As a teenager her daily intake included multi-packs of crisps, litre bottles of fizzy drinks, chips and sausages. She was banned from her school canteen for over-eating. She had stopped attending PE lessons long before. At home, she watched television, surfed the internet and, of course, ate. And ate. Her mother Lesley, who has weighed as much as 31st, must also take a good deal of the blame. She had fed baby Georgia condensed milk and potatoes instead of baby food. Georgia was sent to a ‘fat camp’ in the U.S. after doctors warned she would die if she didn’t lose 20st. In nine months there she lost 14st 6lb as she took regular exercise and existed on 1,500 calories a day. But she was welcomed home with fish and chips and within 20 months was back up to 40st. Crisis point was reached in 2012, by which time the 19-year-old was eating seven kebabs in one sitting and had reached a weight of 63st. It is the second time in three years the emergency services have been summoned to free her from her self-inflicted prison. She also had to be rescued from her home in 2012 in a similar operation . During that incident, a 40-strong team of emergency service personnel and engineers laboured for eight hours to remove her from her bedroom at the housing association home she shared with her mother and stepfather . A 40-strong team of emergency service personnel and engineers laboured for eight hours to remove her from her bedroom at the housing association home she shared with her mother and stepfather. Georgia had collapsed with breathing problems and chest pains. The rescuers had to demolish the top half of the semi and build a scaffold in order to support a ramp to the pavement. Roof supports had to be inserted and she was lifted onto a special stretcher using a crane. Again a reinforced ambulance took her to hospital. The operation, including repairs, was costed at £100,000. Such scenes will be repeated if more is not done to tackle obesity, say campaigners. One in three children in the UK is overweight, while one in five is obese. Teenage girls form the majority of the one million or so obese under-18s. National Obesity Forum spokesman Tam Fry said: ‘It is a military operation. It will be an equivalent cost, which the NHS has to pay. ‘There will be many more Georgia Davises who we don’t know about because they are stuck in their houses and cannot get out without being winched out. ‘The NHS has to introduce screening for children and adults and if we don’t do that we are going to find more of this in the future.’ Additional reporting by BEN WILKINSON .","55stone Georgia Davis, 22, was lifted from her home in 7-hour operation .

"Joko Widodo's chief political rival reportedly promised to publicly support the Indonesian president if he granted clemency to Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. Former Indonesian army general Prabowo Subianto twice privately assured Mr Joko there would be no political consequences if the Bali Nine ringleaders and others on death row were reprieved, The West Australian reported. It's understood Mr Prabowo penned a letter to Mr Joko at the weekend in which he said that if the president were to 'postpone the executions indefinitely', he would come out in support of the decision. Scroll down for video . Indonesian President Joko Widodo (left) ignored reassurances from his chief political rival Prabowo Subianto (right) that he would support a decision to grant clemency to Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . Former Indonesian army general Prabowo Subianto twice privately assured Mr Joko there would be no political consequences if the Bali Nine ringleaders and others on death row were reprieved . Independent senator Nick Xenophon said he was told earlier in the year by human rights advocates that Mr Prabowo - who narrowly lost the presidential elections to Mr Joko in October - was 'very sympathetic' to clemency. As well, he could see that the executions of Chan and Sukumaran could damage relations between Australia and Indonesia. 'I was advised at the time that it would be a bad idea to approach him, so I didn't,' Senator Xenophon told ABC radio. 'One view was that it would enrage President Widodo and make matters worse, and I guess we'll never know.' This comes after a senior Indonesian government official praised the firing squad that executed Bali Nine pair and six other convicted drug traffickers. ABC News reports that Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for their work. 'All shots were done perfectly. These executions were carried out smoothly and in order - much better than the first round of executions in January,' he said. Indonesian president Joko Widodo failed to return Australian PM Tony Abbott's phone calls about the Bali Nine in March . Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo (right) applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for the good job that they did . Mr Prasetyo declared it was necessary to fight drug crime in the country, as he dismissed Australia's withdrawal of its ambassador as a 'momentary reaction'. He visited Nusakambangan on Wednesday, hours after Bali Nine pair were executed with other drug offenders. 'I would like to say that an execution is not a pleasant thing. It is not a fun job,' he said. 'But we must do it in order to save the nation from the danger of drugs. We are not making enemies of counties from where those executed came. What we are fighting against is drug-related crimes. 'Therefore, I would like to offer my condolences, on the execution of those who were on the death row, to their families, to their home countries. 'Once again, we are not against the countries, but we are fighting a war against the horrible drug crimes that threaten our nation's survival.' Mr Prasetyo (second right) said that 'all the shots were done perfectly' at the execution . The Indonesian attorney-general believed that Wednesday morning's execution was much better than one carried out in January . Mr Prasetyo shrugged off diplomatic backlash from Australia after Prime Minister Tony Abbott slammed the executions  as 'cruel and unnecessary' and announced he would withdraw Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson. 'The Netherlands have done the same thing in the past. Brazil has done the same thing,' he said. 'I think this is just a momentary reaction, and this will be settled within the diplomatic sphere.' Indonesia's Vice President Jusuf Kalla said withdrawing an ambassador was a normal diplomatic protest. 'Within a month or two, they will come back. That's the signal of protest, we did that too,' he said, referring to the time Indonesia withdrew its ambassador to Australia in 2013 over a phone tapping scandal. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will withdraw its ambassador to Indonesia in an unprecedented diplomatic response to the executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan . Rest in peace: Myuran Sukumaran (foreground) and Andrew Chan (back) were executed . Prasetyo said the executions would serve as a warning to others. 'This is a warning for others, don't even try to commit these drug crimes, to think a thousand times, that Indonesia will be strict, will be harsh on drug crimes,' he told reporters in Cilacap. 'The result of the second execution was better, more orderly and more perfect than the last,' he said, referring to executions carried out in January and noting the bodies were treated more 'humanely' this time. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo raised his nation's sovereignty when asked about Australia withdrawing its ambassador. 'Our sovereignty must be respected,' he told reporters. 'We're ready to respect the sovereignty of other countries as well.' Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson will return to Australia at the end of this week . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (left) said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect' Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, is widely regarded as weak. He has ignored international pressure to cease executions of foreign drug convicts .","Joko Widodo's chief political rival promised to support clemency .

"The earthquake disaster in Nepal has highlighted how Earth's land masses are already in the process of forming a new supercontinent. That's according to one researcher who travelled to the country to study how the Indian and Eurasian plates are moving together. And using new techniques, researchers can now start examining the changes due to take place over the next tens of millions of years like never before. Earth's continents are slowly moving together (left), and in 50 to 200 million years they are expected to form a new supercontinent called Amasia (right). In 2012 a study suggested this may be centered on the North Pole. Recent evidence is revealing how this will compare to the ancient supercontinents Rodinia and Pangaea . The idea that Earth is set to form a new supercontinent - dubbed Amasia - is not new. But, as reported by Peter Spinks from the Sydney Morning Herald, Curtin University geologist Dr Zheng-Xiang Li travelled to Nepal to study the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. The idea that Earth is set to form a new supercontinent - dubbed Amasia - is not new. But new techniques are allowing experts to study the changes in unprececdented ways. Where exactly this supercontinent will form, however, has been the cause of some debate. While some had suspected it would be centered around Africa, a study by Yale University in 2012 suggested that the North Pole would actually be the centre point. North and South America will crunch together, with the Caribbean Sea and Arctic Ocean disappearing, while Asia will join the Americas, according to the study. They said the changes would occur in 50 to 200 million years. Despite already being attached to Eurasia, the Indian plate is continuing to move North at a few centimetres per year - causing tectonic activity. But other continents are also moving towards each other. The Pacific Ocean is narrowing at a few centimetres per year, which will ultimately cause America to collide with Eurasia, while Australia is also moving towards Asia by 2.8 inches (7cm) a year and will join Amasia. ‘It would take at least tens of millions more years - perhaps several hundred million years - before the new supercontinent is fully formed,’ Dr Li told the SMH. Using new techniques - namely high-resolution seismic tomography, geographical information systems and increased computing power - scientists are able to track these changes in unprecedented ways. For example, they can compare them to previous supercontinents Rodinia and Pangaea, which formed one billion and 300 million years ago respectively. ‘These advances have allowed us to link present-day plate tectonics on Earth's surface to dynamic processes deep in the mantle - and to link these to ancient records of geology,’ Dr Li said. Many of Earth's land masses are continuing to move into each other. The Pacific Ocean is narrowing at a few centimetres per year, which will ultimately cause America to collide with Eurasia, while Australia is also moving towards Asia by 2.8 inches (7cm) a year and will join Amasia . This map shows how Nepal is situated near the border of India and Asia, where two tectonic plates are moving into one another. The Indian plate is continuing to move North at a few centimetres per year - causing tectonic activity, which in turn can lead to tremors and devastating earthquakes . The UN says 8 million people have been affected by the weekend earthquake in Nepal that killed nearly 4,400 people and 1.4 million people are in need of food assistance. Jamie McGoldrick, UN resident coordinator in Kathmandu, told reporters that of those affected two million people are in the 11 worst-hit districts. The challenge of supplying to small villages at high altitudes and in rough terrain ""is quite significant, he said. After flying by helicopter over Dhulikhel town, on the north side of the Kathmandu valley, he estimated about 40% of the houses were damaged, but destruction was erratic. Where exactly this supercontinent will form, however, has been the cause of some debate. While some had suspected it would be centered around Africa, a study by Yale University in 2012 suggested that the North Pole would actually be the centre point. North and South America will crunch together, with the Caribbean Sea and Arctic Ocean disappearing, while Asia will join the Americas, according to the study. They said the changes would occur in 50 to 200 million years. The most recent supercontinent, Pangea (which is Greek for ‘All Lands’), formed about 300 million years ago with Africa at its centre. It began breaking apart into the seven continents of today with the birth of the Atlantic Ocean about 100 million years later. Researchers said the earthquake in Nepal highlighted how dangerous shifting tectonic plates can be. Pictured, Nepalese people walk among the debris of houses after the quake in Bhaktapur. The death toll in Nepal following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake is continuing to rise and could hit 10,000 . This series of graphics shows how our land masses have separated from Pangaea into the distinct continents we have today. Using new techniques - namely high-resolution seismic tomography, geographical information systems and increased computing power - scientists are tracking the changes in better detail . Researchers believe Pangea is the third or fourth supercontinent in Earth’s history. Its immediate predecessors were Rodinia - which formed around 1 billion years ago - and Nuna, which formed 1.8 billion years ago. The idea of continental drift was introduced by German scientist Alfred Wegener in 1912 to explain how the shape of Earth’s countries looked suspiciously like jigsaw pieces that would fit together. The Earth’s surface is formed from seven major and several minor tectonic plates that wander around at speeds varying from a few millimetres to two centimetres a year, the same pace that a human nail grows. It’s the friction caused by plates grinding against each other that causes earthquakes.","Peter Spinks from the Sydney Morning Herald reported on Amasia .

"Tesla founder Elon Musk has unveiled a 'revolutionary' $3,000 (£1,980) battery which he claims can run an entire home for eight hours. Musk introduced the Powerwall device at a press conference in California last night and said the technology could 'change the world'. The device, which could be in homes by the end of summer, will be able to store electricity at night when it is cheaper. Scroll down for video . Tesla has unveiled a $3,000 (£1,980) home battery that can power an entire house for eight hours. Powerwall is three feet wide and four feet tall, weighs 220lbs, and can be installed on an outside or inside wall. The left images shows the 10kWh version while on the right is the 7kWh device . The technology powers up overnight when electricity rates are cheaper. Users can then switch the battery on during the day to use the home during the day. Powerwall can be used as back up power in the case of an emergency, or be used to hold power from renewable energy sources. The 'daily use' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt-hours, which is around a quarter of a home's daily usage. The  average U.S. home uses 10,908 kilowatt-hours of energy per year, or just short of 30 per day. Home battery packs could disrupt the utility market. In 2013, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for investor-owned electric companies, issued a report warning about disruption. 'One can imagine a day when battery storage technology or micro turbines could allow customers to be electric grid independent,' the report said. It would then discharge this cheap electricity during the day in quantities large enough to be useful to homes and businesses. The  Powerwall is around three feet wide and four feet tall, weighs 220lbs, and can be installed either on an outside or inside wall of a home. The 'daily use' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt-hours, which is around a quarter of a home's daily usage. Department of Energy figures state that the average U.S. home uses 10,908 kilowatt-hours of energy per year, or just short of 30 per day. According to that figure, a single, fully-charged Powerwall device would be able to meet a quarter of a home's energy needs on any given day. However, it would likely last far less time than eight hours during the mornings and evenings, when homes use the vast majority of their electricity. Musk said that the devices can be stacked together to provide more energy. The system would let homeowners with solar panels or other sources of renewable energy easily store their energy at home, rather than the current model whereby they sell power back to energy suppliers as it is produced, then buy it again during peak times. It could also let savvy consumers take advantage of power companies' lower rates during the night and use the cheaper, stored energy during peak periods. According to tech site Mashable, Musk told attendees at the event: 'Our goal is to fundamentally change the way the world uses energy. Pictured is a utility-scale version of Powerwall that can be used by businesses and scaled up for more power . The 'daily use' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt-hours, which is around a quarter of a home's daily usage . Tesla also unveiled the 'Powerpack', which is the big brother of the Powerwall. It describes it as an 'infinitely scalable system' that can work for businesses, in industrial applications, and public utility companies. It comes in 100 kWh battery blocks that can scale from 500 kWH all the way up to 10 MWh. 'Our goal here is to change the way the world uses energy at an extreme scale,' it said. 'It sounds crazy, but we want to change the entire energy infrastructure of the world to zero carbon.' As well as the daily-use model, Tesla will also launch a 10 kilowatt-hour backup battery, designed to tide homes over during power blackouts, such as those caused by storms. Marketing material for the device, published late Thursday on Tesla's website, says: 'Powerwall is a home battery that charges using electricity generated from solar panels, or when utility rates are low, and powers your home in the evening. 'It also fortifies your home against power outages by providing a backup electricity supply. 'Automated, compact and simple to install, Powerwall offers independence from the utility grid and the security of an emergency backup.' Musk said that he hopes to sell hundreds of millions of the devices, which he touted as a vast improvement over currently-available models. In the past he has said such early batteries 'suck'. He later added that the entire showcase had been powered by a huge array of Powerwall batteries. Pictured is the 'powerpack'.

The latest announcement builds on previous Tesla products, principally its range of cars. Last year, Tesla Motors unveiled plans for a 'Gigafactory' designed to help the firm ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars, and now homes. Tesla said the factory will cut current battery production costs by up to 30 per cent, and will be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. Elsewhere, Mr Musk is already the chairman of SolarCity - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and Tesla's home battery could be an extension of this. These batteries 3ft tall (0.9 metres), and can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app. Tesla would not comment on whether the new batteries will work in the same way. Home battery packs could disrupt the utility market. In 2013, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for investor-owned electric companies, issued a report warning about disruption. Powerwall charges using electricity generated from solar panels, or when utility rates are low, and powers your home in the evening . 'One can imagine a day when battery storage technology or micro turbines could allow customers to be electric grid independent,' the report said. Deutsche Bank estimates sales of stationary battery storage systems for homes and commercial uses could yield as much as $4.5 billion in revenue for Tesla. Analysts expect Tesla will build stationary storage systems around the same basic batteries it will produce for its vehicles at a large factory the company is building in Nevada. Stationary storage systems could be part of a fossil-fuel free lifestyle in which an individual has solar panels on the roof, generating electricity that can power home appliances and recharge batteries in a Tesla Model S sedan parked in the garage. Government subsidies and a dramatic drop in the price of lithium ion batteries are drawing more companies into the home electricity storage business. Tesla has so far received $1.1 million from California's Self-Generation Incentive Program. Tesla has received or is poised to receive state funding for about 600 storage projects in California, according to data from the state. Though valued at just $200 million in 2012, the energy storage industry is expected to grow to $19 billion by 2017, according to research firm IHS CERA. In Tesla's view, such storage systems could become part of a fossil-fuel-free lifestyle in which people can have solar panels on their roof generating electricity to power their home and recharge their electric car batteries .","Musk unveiled Powerwall device at press conference in California .

"What Alastair Cook did here, particularly in the first hour of his innings, was spot-on. That has to be his template from now on and if he carries on the way he has played here in Grenada, those hundreds will come again. This was really encouraging for the England captain but ultimately hugely frustrating because he couldn’t push on to that all-important hundred. Cook’s problem has been opponents stopping him scoring in areas where he has always been prolific. He has struggled when he has looked to make runs with shots that he rarely employed before. Alastair Cook's innings into day three in Grenada was spot on, particularly the first hour of it . Cook worked his way to an encouraging 50 but frustratingly was out playing Shannon Gabriel on for 76 . Yet it is nonsense to say a batsman who has hit 25 Test hundreds cannot drive the ball. Of course he can. The key for him is not to play the drive too early, when the ball is moving around and his balance at the crease is not quite right. Perhaps it has been playing too much one-day cricket, perhaps it has just been the pressure to score big runs again, but Cook has been searching for the ball far too early. Here he left the ball outside off stump and made the bowlers come to him, which took a lot of mental strength and composure. The drag-on was always going to be a danger on this pitch but Cook was right to try to play that shot because the cut is one of his big strengths. His eyes lit up when he was bowled a short, wide one by Shannon Gabriel. But the ball just lacked pace, Cook was through the shot too early, the angle from round the wicket tucked him up and the inside edge came into play. He cannot admonish himself for playing at the delivery. Boy, do I admire Cook’s fortitude and the concentration he showed on that sluggish pitch with an incredibly slow outfield. The England captain hits behind square on the onside as Jermaine Blackwood ducks for cover . Cook left the ball outside off stump and made the bowlers come to him, but drove when the option arose . He is stronger mentally than anyone he will face, so he just has to carry on showing the same discipline. The bowlers will become bored before he does. The fact is, 76 here was pretty much worth a hundred in these day-three conditions, but sadly for Cook that is not how the record books will show it. The England captain was aided by the fact the ball did not swing much for West Indies, because it is the moving delivery that has caused him so many problems. It is to Cook’s credit that he has not looked under pressure in this second Test and his recent statistics — four scores of 70-plus in his last seven Test innings — are absolutely fine for a normal human being. The problem for him is that until the age of 28 he wasn’t normal; he was an absolute run machine. Cook's off stump is rattled after a wide delivery from Gabriel found the inside edge . The skipper shows his frustration as his impressive innings to this point is cut short . Gabriel celebrates after Cook's eyes lit but the ball just lacked pace and he was through the shot too early . West Indies celebrate the breakthrough  but Cook cannot admonish himself for playing at the delivery . Cook just has to put that one key statistic to bed and finally reach three figures, then move on with such a big summer ahead. His inability to do so means we are still talking about how long it’s been since his last Test century but there were good signs here. Meanwhile, Jonathan Trott still looked a little frenetic at the start of his innings, certainly for those first 10 to 15 runs when he was searching for the ball and driving when he did not need to. Jonathan Trott drives during his first innings of 59, which started day three somewhat frenetically . Cook congratulates a smiling Trott after his fellow opener reached his 50 milestone in the morning session . Yet as his innings progressed, he looked calmer and it was significant when he started walking off towards square leg between deliveries. He was in his little bubble again and it showed me that he was back. Trott has obviously been through a heck of a lot, has looked anxious and wants to prove the point that he belongs back with England and that he can open the batting in Tests. The more he played, the more he looked like Jonathan Trott. Trott looked calmer as his innings went on but Devendra Bishoo found his edge before he could go on with it . Trott leaves the field at St George's - on St George's Day - after an opening partnership of 125 runs .","Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott put on an opening partnership of 125 .

Toya Graham, a single mother-of-six, was caught on camera whacking her 16-year-old son Michael, pulling off his ski mask and chasing him down the street as rioters clashed with police, looted stores and burned down buildings and cars. The riots broke out following the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray earlier this month who died of a spinal cord injury after being taken into custody by Baltimore police. Her actions have drawn praise from moms across the country along with the Baltimore police chief who said: 'I wish there were more parents out there who took charge of their kids tonight.' Miss Graham told CBS on Wednesday that she 'just lost it' when she saw Michael at Monday's riots carrying a rock and walking towards police officers. She said: 'I recognized those baggy sweatpants and we made eye contact. I was saying ''how dare you do this?''' Scroll down for video . Single mother-of-six Toya Graham spoke on Wednesday about dragging her teenage son home from the Baltimore riots, adding that when she saw the video clip, she thought: 'My pastor is going to kill me' Graham went down to where the riots were taking place after hearing schools had been let out early. She said she recognized her son's baggy sweatpants and 'lost it' Graham, a single mother-of-six, has drawn praise across the country, for getting her rioting son in check . Her son immediately lost his tough-guy swagger as his mother pulled the ski mask from his head, clipped him around the ears and yelled: ''Are you for real? Really? This is what you want to do? 'I told you I'd come down here. Didn't I? Didn't I?' She poignantly added: 'That's my only son and at the end of the day, I don't want him to be a Freddie Gray. I cant imagine what Freddie Gray's mother is going through. I don't want to lose my son to the streets. 'Is he a perfect boy? No he's not. But he's mine.' And despite her concerns about what her pastor would think, he had nothing but praise for the mother of six on Wednesday. Pastor Jamal Bryant told Inside Edition that Toya was 'Mom of the Century'. She said: 'I wish all of the parents of Baltimore would take on her spirit and go pull your children out of the streets.' Miss Graham's actions saw her grabbing headlines across the U.S. as Baltimore erupted into a second night of riots on Tuesday. She was even trending on Twitter with the hashtag, #momoftheyear, as social media users asked how to send her gifts ahead of Mother's Day. However Graham said on Wednesday: 'I don't feel like a hero. My intention was to get my son and have him be safe. I knew the whole thing was not safe.' She said the night before the riots, her son told her that a lot of high school students were planing to meet up at Mondawmin Mall on Monday afternoon, the day of Freddie Gray's funeral. She warned him not to go to the mall. The mom was at a doctor's appointment with her eldest daughter the next day when she heard that schools had been let out early and people were gathering at the mall, which is also a main transportation hub in the area. She left the doctor's office immediately to go find her son. Graham told CBS: 'There was a mass of police and helicopters. I ran over to the police and asked ''where are the children that have to take this bus route?'' They were throwing bricks at the police.' She recognized her son even though he was wearing a black ski mask over much of his face. He was also carrying a rock. When he saw her coming, his first instinct was to run away. She said: 'He knew he was in trouble. At that point, I just lost it. I was shocked, I was angry, because you never want to see your child out there doing that.' Mother and son got home and turned on the TV so they could continue to watch coverage of the riots. Michael Graham pictured on Facebook with his mom and a younger family member. The mom said her teenage son has been in trouble before 'but knows right from wrong' As they watched what was happening outside their home, Michael's Facebook feed began to fill up with people who had seen the video of his mom reeling him in. Many people wrote that Michael shouldn't be mad at his mom, but rather 'give her a hug'. Graham explained her fury at seeing her son caught up in police violence also came from a place of deep worry as a parent. She said: 'A lot of his friends have been killed. I just want to keep him in the house, but that's not really going to work. 'He's been in trouble before. He knows right from wrong but he's just like other teens, he doesn't have the perfect relationship with the police in Baltimore.' However, the mother said that none of this excused violence towards the police officers. 'You will not be throwing rocks and stones at police officers. Whose to say they don't have to come and protect me from something?' she added. However Graham, who is also a grandmother, admitted that she understood some of the frustration being felt towards the police department in her Baltimore community. At some point, I understand the frustration that our community is having,' she said. 'We haven't received any information on what happened to this young guy [Freddie Gray]. From looking at it from the news point of view, it seemed like he was harmed. 'And if he hadn't been harmed, we, the people of Baltimore city, we feel like we have the right to know.' According to Toya Graham's Facebook profile, she went to high school about ten minutes away from where Freddie Gray was arrested on April 12. In an Instagram video from two months ago, Michael posed in a very similar outfit with face mask and dark clothing to what he was wearing on Monday . The Baltimore native was described as an assistant manager at an alcohol and drug treatment center that offered inpatient and outpatient treatment as well as manages crisis and halfway housing. However on Wednesday, she told CBS that she had recently lost a job and had moved home. She said that her son had witnessed her have a tough time. 'He sees me struggle,' she said. 'It's just me and my children. I don't go out. The only thing I do is church.' Graham laughed when she said the first thing that ran through her head when she saw herself on TV, was 'my pastor is going to have a fit!' Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts mentioned Graham's heroics when he spoke at a press conference shortly before midnight on Monday. Batts said: 'In one scene you had a mother who grabbed a child who had a hood on his head and started smacking him on the head because she was so embarrassed. 'I wish there were more parents out there who took charge of their kids tonight.' He later added: 'Take control of your kids. This is our city, let's make a difference.' Graham, who said she sometimes has to 'shield' her son from the violence outside her home, has seen what can happen on the streets of Baltimore first-hand. In August of 2014, she was at her home when at least three shots were fired and a man was killed outside on the street on her block in the middle of the night. The concerned mother checked on her children before heading outside to try to help the victim. The man died before he could be taken to the hospital and Graham was so shaken, she couldn't even go to work the next day, according to ABC 2. She said at the time: 'Soon we're not even going to be able to walk out of our doors. That was somebody's child, and it's real overwhelming that somebody takes somebody's life like that and he was just left there.' Toya Graham (pictured left in 2014) was at her Baltimore home when at least three shots were fired and a man was killed on the street. Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts (right) praised her during a press conference on Monday . One woman said: 'Baltimore doesn't need the National Guard - they need more parents like this one!' The encounter between mother and son on the Baltimore street was captured by WMAR. The video did not fly under the radar on social media either and many Twitter users began re-posting it and saying the woman was the 'Mom of the Year'. After Graham was identified on Tuesday, even more people began offering up their congratulation and appreciation for what she had done. One person wrote: 'The mother of the year is Toya Graham - she is now my hero - I love her - she is awesome - she parents - LOVE HER.' Someone else said: '#Toyagraham my respect to the mother who tried to stop her son from joining the #baltimoreriotss. As I often say 'off with his hoodie'' Another Twitter user added: 'Mother's Day is May 10th, someone better do something for Toya Graham!' Blows rained down on the son's head as he struggled to get away while a large crowd looked on . One Twitter user said: 'Mother's Day is May 10th, someone better do something for Toya Graham'","Toya Graham, a single mother-of-six, said she 'just lost it' when she saw her 16-year-old son Michael at Monday's riots carrying a rock .

"Iran's Revolutionary Guards 'harassed' a US-flagged commercial ship just days before it seized a vessel carrying cargo and 34 sailors, it has emerged. The two incidents have raised concerns about the security of shipping lanes in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steven Warren said. News of the first incident was revealed by the Pentagon after Iranian guards seized MV Maersk Tigris this week, by firing warning shots across the vessel's bows. ranian patrol vessels fired warning shots across the bridge of the Marshall Islands-flagged cargo vessel the Maersk Tigris Tuesday morning and seized it for trespassing just days after it had 'harassed' another ship . In the April 24 incident, four Iranian patrol boats with the country's elite Revolutionary Guards 'harassed a US-flagged merchant ship called the Maersk Kensington' as it moved along an established shipping route, said Mr Warren. The Iranian vessels 'followed her for approximately 15 to 20 minutes in actions the ship master of the Kensington interpreted as aggressive,' he said. The American military was not involved in the incident and the Kensington's captain later filed a report with the US Navy describing the event. Just four days later, Iranian boats forced a Marshall Islands-flagged ship, the Maersk Tigris, to Iran's Larak Island after firing warning shots across the bows and boarding the vessel. Iran has said it seized control of the container ship due to a commercial dispute with Denmark's giant Maersk group, which chartered the vessel to ferry cargo in the region. When it was intercepted, the Tigris was traveling on an international shipping route within Iran's territorial waters. 'It's difficult to know exactly why the Iranians are behaving this way,' Warren said. 'We call on them to respect all of the internationally established rules of freedom of navigation, the law of the sea to which they are a signatory and other established protocols,' he said. The 52,600-ton container ship was built in 2014 and is managed by Singapore-based Rickmers Ship Management . Iranian sources have seized the cargo ship and claim they had a legal order following a dispute . In a statement, the Iranian Port and Maritime Organisation said the Maersk Tigris was intercepted 'upon a legal order' and transferred to Shahid Bahonar port in southern Iran. Officials claimed the order was issued following a 'long running commercial dispute' with Maersk. The ruling was 'based on a lawsuit by a private company called Pars Talayieh Oil Product company (Golden Pars Oil Products) against Maersk ship company,' it said. They said the ship can only be released following a judicial ruling. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, speaking at New York University, said a lawsuit was filed against the ship's owners between 15 and 16 years ago over an undelivered cargo. 'It has gone through court proceedings in Tehran based on what I hear from the lawyer. The final decision by the court is that the ship's owners are supposed to pay damages,' he said. Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television station reported earlier the vessel was US-flagged, but it has since emerged that the cargo ship is registered in the Pacific island nation and had no Americans aboard. The semi-official Iranian news agency Fars also reported that Iran took control of the MV Maersk Tigris for 'trespassing' on its territorial waters. Warren said the cargo ship's master had initially refused an Iranian order to move further into Iranian waters, but after the warning shots were fired the cargo ship complied. The vessel was then boarded by Iranians, but no one has been injured and no Americans are involved. Detained: A map of the vessel's route shows that it abruptly changed course in the Strait of Hormuz this morning and was heading to the Iranian port on Bandfar Abbas . Warren said the cargo ship issued a distress call and US Naval Forces Central Command, based in the area, sent a US destroyer, the USS Farragut, and a P-3 surveillance aircraft to the area of the incident to monitor the situation. 'What they are doing is keeping an eye on things. They are in close enough proximity to the Maersk Tigris that they will be able to respond if a response is required,' he added. As the US government had defense and other ties with the Marshall Islands, US officials were 'in discussion with the Marshall Islands on the way ahead,' he said. 'The Republic of Marshall Islands has requested assistance for the release of the Maersk ship, and again, we're in communication with them about how best to expect that outcome,' State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. But US officials said privately that no military action was imminent. According to the ship-tracking site MarineTraffic.com, the 52,600-ton cargo vessel, which was built last year, departed from Ambarli, Turkey April 8 en route to Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

A map of the vessel's route shows that it abruptly changed course in the Strait of Hormuz this morning and was heading to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. New of the seizure and action against another vessel comes amid heightened tensions in the Gulf, fuelled by the Yemen conflict and high-stakes diplomacy between Washington and Tehran over Iran's nuclear program. In October 2012, Maersk announced a halt to its activities in Iran after Western oil and financial sanctions were slapped on the country over its controversial nuclear program. The ship was operated by Rickmers Ship Management, with head offices in Singapore and Hamburg, and was carrying cargo for Maersk Line, the group's shipping unit which had chartered the vessel. A spokesman for the Danish group said the Maersk Tigris does not belong to the company and it does not employ the crew. The shipping group A.P. Moeller-Maersk also said Wednesday that the crew was safe but it remained tight-lipped about any commercial dispute.","Iran Revolutionary Guards seized MV Maersk Tigris with 34 sailors aboard .

"Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey claims that covert racism still exists in football boardrooms and that the implementing of a Rooney Rule could help raise awareness of the issue. Ramsey, the only black manager in the Premier League, has been vocal on racism in football in the past and supports John Barnes’s assertion that black managers find it difficult to get another job after being sacked. ‘Just because I’m sitting here I’m not going to change my views of many years,’ said Ramsey, who takes his side to West Brom in search of a much-needed three points on Saturday. Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey claims that covert racism still exists in football boardrooms . Ramsey believes that the implementing of a Rooney Rule could help raise awareness of the 'covert' issue . John Barnes’ view that black managers find it hard to get a job after being sacked was backed up by Ramsey . ‘The fact we’re still, at this stage of the game, highlighting that I’m the only black Premier League manager shows that it’s not the norm to have people from ethnic minorities in this position. ‘So until this becomes normal, and it’s not highlighted in such a spectacular fashion, racism will be prominent. ‘Obviously, I’m in a very fortunate position to be the manager of QPR but I hope people won’t look at that as a token gesture. I think I’ve earned my stripes to be in this position. Barnes' last managerial job was at Tranmere in 2009. He lasted four months before being sacked . Ramsey is operating as the only black manager in the Premier League as he looks to keep QPR up . Ramsey was without a job for seven months after leaving his coaching role at Tottenham last season . ‘I think that there are other people who are probably more talented or better suited, from a profile point of view, as many white managers who have got jobs based on their profile and playing experience.’ The 52-year-old manager thinks that discrimination isn’t exclusive to race and that the Rooney Rule — which obliges America’s NFL teams to interview minority candidates for top jobs — might be the solution here. ‘If it doesn’t work out for me here, I think that, as any manager of any race, I think you’re always in a position where it’s difficult to get another job,’ he said. QPR travel to face West Bromwich Albion after disappointingly losing at home to Everton last time out . Aaron Lennon is congratulated by his team-mates at Loftus Road as the QPR players head for the half-way line . ‘As a black man, I think it’s always going to be difficult anyway. I think the Rooney Rule is an important factor as there’s an awareness that something has to be done to affect the way people think in boardrooms. ‘I’m not just talking about race, I’m talking about gender, homophobia and other issues. I think there needs to be more awareness of factors that affect why people get jobs or not.’","QPR manager Chris Ramsey is the Premier League's only black manager .

"Forget friendly competition – it seems that real friends in the fashion world will do all they can in order to help promote each other, including starring in a campaign for a competing label. Versace designer Donatella Versace, 59, is set to appear in a new ad campaign not for her own brand, but for rival design house Givenchy. Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci, 40, revealed the surprising pick for his fall-winter campaign on Instagram yesterday, posting a black and white photo of himself and Donatella, who he described as his ‘ultimate icon’. Double the designer power: Versace designer Donatella Versace appears in a photo with Riccardo Tisci for Givenchy's new ad campaign . 'So proud and honored to introduce my new ultimate icon: Donatella Versace... FW15 Givenchy Family Campaign [sic],' he wrote, while promising that more images from the campaign will be unveiled soon. Donatella re-posted the snap on her own account, captioning it: 'For my talented friend Riccardo. Together we break fashion boundaries today!' 'You made my day unforgettable,' she continued in another post, thanking Riccardo and the shoot's photographers, Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Fashionable friends: Donatella, left, and Riccardo, second from left, are longtime friends; they are pictured here with Franca Sozzani, second from right, and Naomi Campbell, right . Big name in the business: Donatella regularly appears in ads for her own design house, Versace, but this is the first time she is modeling for another designer. Casting Donatella in the campaign is without a doubt an unusual choice - both high-fashion brands attract similar clientele, including celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Zoe Saldana - but the designers have actually been friends for years, since first meeting at a Vogue Italia dinner a decade ago. In fact, Donatella interviewed Riccardo for Interview Magazine in 2011, telling him she found his most recent collection at the time to be 'very beautiful - super sexy' before adding that she would 'wear all of it'. That didn't surprise Riccardo, as the designer explained that he was 'obsessed' with Versace as a child and is still inspired by the brand's designs. 'Donatella, you are so much of a Givenchy woman!' he told her. 'I would really love to see you dressed in Givenchy.' Backstage BFFs: Riccardo posted this photo of himself with Donatella during Paris Haute Couture Week . Both Givenchy and Versace have many celebrity fans; Donatella is pictured here with Versace lovers Kate Hudson, left, and Goldie Hawn, right, at Paris Fashion Week this year . Riccardo has more recently proved that he is a fan of Donatella's work as well. At Paris Haute Couture Week earlier this year, the Givenchy designer posted a picture of the pair together backstage and referred to Donatella as a 'couture queen' in the photo's caption. Now, Donatella is returning the complement by lending her face to his Givenchy ads. 'You are one of the most talented designers there,' she told him in 2011. 'What you and I have in common, Donatella, [is] that careful balance,' he said, referring to their joint ability to push boundaries without becoming vulgar. Now the pair will have Givenchy's fall-winter campaign in common too.","Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci, 40, announced that Donatella, 59, will appear in his new ad campaign .

"David Haye was arrested at Dubai airport and held in a police cell over a £341,000 bounced cheque, it has been reported. Former two-weight world champion Haye, 34, was stopped by officials on his arrival at Dubai International Airport and accused of fraud by writing a cheque as payment for a new property which bounced. The boxer, who has not fought since he defeated Dereck Chisora in July 2012, also handed over his passport to authorities, and has been unable to leave the United Arab Emirates - forcing him to miss a mixed martial arts event in Birmingham at the weekend. Former heavyweight boxing champion David Haye was stopped at Dubai International Airport and questioned over allegations that he wrote a £341,000 cheque which bounced. He is pictured during his trip to Dubai . The cheque, worth 1.8million Emirati Dirham, was intended as a final payment on a newly-built property, as part of a deal with developers Emaar, which is part-owned by the Dubai government. Haye has said the 'bounced' cheque  was down to an administrative error. He told The Sun's Michael Hamilton: 'The cheque was presented to the bank four days before I landed. It was not due to be presented until final completion of my property, which is due in a few weeks. 'This was an administrative error which is being rectified. I explained to the police and presented documents as proof. But I can totally understand these mistakes can happen.' Writing a cheque that later bounces is a crime in Dubai, and can be punishable with jail, a fine, and being ordered to pay the amount. Haye had been due to attend a mixed martial arts event in Birmingham on Saturday but was unable to leave the UAE. Instead he went to a Robbie Williams concert in Abu Dhabi . Police give suspects one month to pay the value of the cheque before taking the case to court. Figures released last June showed that Dubai police dealt with almost 80,000 bounced cheques in 2013-14, worth 9.4billion Dirham, or £1.7bn. According to The Sun, Haye was held at the airport as he arrived for a holiday earlier this month after he was flagged up on a wanted list. He was reportedly taken to Bur Dubai police station, which has a department for bounced cheque suspects, and was released the same day. He surrendered his passport, as did two of his associates. The Foreign Office is understood to have had no involvement in the case. Haye has not been seen in the boxing ring since he defeated Dereck Chisora in July 2012. He is pictured after the fight at Upton Park with the WBA and WBO International Heavyweight Championship belts . During his stay in Dubai, Haye has reportedly been staying at the luxurious Palm Jumeirah development, and has been tweeting photographs of himself enjoying the sunshine, as well as meeting fans. He posted a video to his Instagram account today thanking fans for their concern over an 'administrative issue' as he walked along a beach in the sunshine. In the video, which he captioned 'Don't worry about me too much!!!', he said: 'Thanks for all your worry and concern but don't get too stressed about me, things aren't that bad. 'A little administrative issue has left me in Dubai for a few days longer than anticipated but it's getting smoothed out as we speak and I'll be back - probably in London or Las Vegas soon.' Haye had been due to attend a BAMMA mixed martial arts event in Birmingham on Saturday, where he was to present a live broadcast for channel Spike TV, but was forced to cancel due to his extended stay in Dubai. Instead, his place on the commentary team was taken by WBA super-middleweight champion Carl Froch. In an Instagram message which was also posted to the event's Facebook page, Haye said: 'Sorry I can't be there tonight for BAMMA 20, I'm gutted, I'm stuck here in Dubai but I'll be there on June 13 in Birmingham for BAMMA 21.' 'Enjoy the action tonight, it's going to be great.' While he should have been in Birmingham, Haye instead told his 1.05 million Twitter followers that he had been to a Robbie Williams concert in Abu Dhabi, writing: 'Rluctantly came to @robbiewilliams concert Abu Dhabi, as not my style of music. But I'm a fan now, pure old school!' [sic]. Haye has not been seen in the  ring since he defeated Dereck Chisora in July 2012, while two planned fights against British rival Tyson Fury have fallen through, the second as a result of shoulder surgery. Despite being advised by doctors to give up boxing, he is said to be planning a comeback and hopes to fight again within the next 18 months. Since his last fight he has also appeared in the 12th series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here, finishing third in the television contest in November 2012. MailOnline has contacted Emaar for comment.","David Haye stopped on arrival at Dubai International Airport for a holiday .

"It is always revealing to see how players respond to adversity and Joe Root has reacted magnificently to being left out of last year’s Sydney Test. I can remember players left out when I played having a moan in the dressing room and spouting nonsense about how they did not fit in. What Root has done is have a look at himself, stay quiet and then produce hundred after hundred to ensure he will not be left out in a hurry again. Joe Root showed plenty of grit, as well as talent, in yet another big innings for England . Root has bounced back from a difficult Ashes Tour to prove himself as a quality Test batsman . Around four years ago I remember sitting next to Graham Thorpe on a bus journey and him quietly telling me that the young English batsman to watch out for was Joe Root. He was barely heard of then. How right Thorpe was, for what Root has done since Sydney speaks volumes about the character of the bloke. Do not be fooled by the boyish grin and cheeky demeanour. He is as steely as they come, a fierce competitor who loves playing for England. He tells himself every day that he must enjoy the game but that takes nothing away from the quality of his magnificent performances. His last five hundreds have been in excess of 149, four of them have been unbeaten and in the way he batted with Jimmy Anderson yesterday he showed he has a very good cricket brain. And he hasn’t messed with his form either. It would be easy in his current run to chip up a catch on 40 or give it away as soon as he reaches a hundred, as Marlon Samuels did in the first innings here. I love the way Root goes big. Before his partner was foolishly run out, Root showed maturity to bat with the tail on Friday in Grenada . The young batsman has been superb in his middle-order role, and should not be moved up the batting card . Part of me sees Root as a natural No 3, where England tried him in Australia. He looks like a batsman who could come in and regain the initiative if you lose an early wicket. But why move him when he is going so well at five? Keep him there. Eventually he will captain England and five is a good place to captain from. The only problem in seeing him as a future England captain is that do we want to put our best player in charge when his runs are so important? Look at Alastair Cook and just about every England captain in history. It wears them all down in the end and when the day eventually comes that England need a new leader they will have to think about that. His fabulous form should be enough to see Root left to do what he does best - score runs for England . Alastair Cook (right) has shown the danger of making your best player the captain of the team . I have enjoyed the battle between Ben Stokes and Samuels in this Test and I like the way the Durham lad goes about his cricket. The fact he gave Mitchell Johnson a send-off when he got him out in Australia speaks volumes for him and he’ll never take a backward step. I generally don’t like send-offs. Once a batsman is out you have done your job so why point to the dressing room or swear at someone? But I enjoyed what Samuels did on the third evening. If you are going to do it, make it humorous and non-threatening like that salute. Stokes will have to take it. If you dish it out you have to take it back. Stokes shouldn’t go too far, though. I saw Peter Moores take him to one side for a chat before play yesterday and that might have been to say: ‘Be careful. Don’t lose your passion but don’t do anything stupid.’","Joe Root has been terrific to bounce back from a difficult time in Australia .
Root's 182* in the first innings in Grenada showed he is a steely competitor .
He looks a natural No 3, but England shouldn't move him from current spot .

"Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling is no stranger to the back pages, but he hit the headlines again for all the wrong reasons on Sunday after he was allegedly pictured smoking a shisha pipe. In a photograph revealed by the Sunday Mirror, the 20-year-old is seen taking a drag from the large orange pipe – containing fruit-scented tobacco and smoked through hot coals via a tube – in a picture published in the Sunday Mirror.

The England international (right) played in the Red's FA Cup quarter final win over Blackburn on Wednesday . Sterling, who has 14 caps for England, was snapped on a social media site with the picture captioned ‘1 down 3 to go’, suggesting there was more puffing in store for the youngster that night. It is said that one single shisha session is equal to smoking around 200 cigarettes. Having already irked certain Reds fans for refusing to dedicate his immediate future to Brendan Rodgers’ team after being offered the improved contract offer, he could again cut an unpopular figure for putting his health at risk during the Merseysiders’ run in to fight for a top four place in the Premier League. Sterling (second right) attended the launch of the 2015-16 Liverpool kit at Anfield on Friday afternoon . There was a large turnout for the launch of the new kit, which will be worn throughout the 2015-16 season . On the The British Heart Foundation website it clearly states: ‘Like cigarettes [shisha] contains nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide and heavy metals, such as arsenic and lead.' However Sterling is not the first England international to be caught indulging himself in the increasingly popular fad. Jack Wilshere became embroiled in his third smoking controversy in 15 months after a picture emerged of the Arsenal midfielder holding a shisha pipe at a nightclub in February. The 23-year-old was recovering from ankle surgery after sustaining an injury during a defeat by Manchester United in November last year. Choosing to keep his disciplinary plans private at the time of Wilshere's misdemeanour, Gunners boss Arsene Wenger was clear about his views on players that choose inhale potentially harmful substances. England and Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere (right) was involved in a smoking controversy back in February . 'I disagree completely with that behaviour,' the Frenchman said. 'When you're a football player you are an example and as well you don't do what damages your health. 'When you go out socially [and smoke] you as well damage your reputation as an example.' Depending on the result in the Manchester derby on Sunday afternoon, Sterling and his Liverpool team-mates could close the gap between themselves and fourth placed Manchester City to four points if the Blues fall to their local rivals and if they defeat Newcastle on Monday.","Raheem Sterling was pictured on social media smoking from a shisha pipe .

"For former Ole Miss star Marshall Henderson, revenge is a dish best served cold. The ex-college player was mocked for his alleged drug use by Erin Andrews on Twitter two years ago. But he has had the last laugh, after he jumped on revelations the TV reporter's boyfriend, Los Angeles Kings player Jarret Stoll, was busted in Las Vegas last week, accused of tying to smuggle cocaine and MDMA, or 'molly', into the MGM Grand hotel. He tweeted  the former Dancing With The Stars contestant on Monday saying: 'lol wassup with your boyfriend.' Revenge: Former Ole Miss star Marshall Henderson jumped on the revelations Jarret Stoll (right) was arrested in a drugs bust last week by tweeting to Erin Andrews: 'lol wassup with your boyfriend.' He was suspended in 2013 for allegedly failing a drugs test. Andrews responded to the news then by saying: 'He mocking anyone now?' She was referencing his reputation of being a hothead and badmouthing other players. Henderson responded with the message: 'ima save that and you will be the first person ill mock.' He has waited two years to get his revenge. On Monday TMZ sports reported that the athlete was trying to smuggle over three grams of cocaine and over eight grams of MDMA by hiding them in his board shorts. Stoll was previously in the news for non-sports related reasons back in 2013 when he was rushed to the hospital after having a seizure at his home in Hermosa Beach, California during the offseason, with the Kings later saying they did not know what caused the incident. His reaction came two years after the TV reporter said: 'He mocking anyone now?' after he was suspended for failing a drugs test. He warned the ex-Dancing With The Stars contestant she was in the firing line . After learning of Stoll's arrest, he posted this on Twitter to Andrews - getting his revenge two years on . Stoll, who will make a cameo in the upcoming film version of the popular HBO show Entourage, was booked into the Clark County Detention Center and was listed as having a hearing on Saturday after posting $5,000 bail. The charges include possession of Class 1, 2, 3 and 4 controlled substances, including cocaine and ecstasy. Michael Pariente, a Las Vegas criminal defense lawyer, says that Stoll will likely be offered a plea deal as a first time offender. Speaking with TSN, he said; 'It's pretty much a slap on the wrist. Even if he was going to represent himself they'd make him an offer like this.' This would include a $1,000 fee, an online drug awareness course, and possibly community service. Henderson is currently playing in Baghdad in the Iraqi Super League. His history with cocaine and marijuana use led to him being undrafted by the NBA in 2014.

"Scientists are baffled after discovering a rare deep sea oarfish had washed up on a salt marsh in New Zealand. The serpent like specimen was found by a local man at the entrance of the Otago Harbour, in Dunedin on Thursday. Samples of the bizaree creature, known to swim vertically as well self-amputate its own tail, were sent to see Otago Museum for testing. Department of Conservation service manager David Agnew pictured with a three-metre oarfish which washed up at the entrance of the Otago Harbour on Thursday . Department of Conservation service manager David Agnew told Daily Mail Australia he had never seen anything like it. ‘I was in the area when a local man called me and said he had found a strange looking fish on his morning walk. It was unlike anything I had ever seen.' 'It must have just washed up and it was very fresh. It’s a very weird looking creature. Instead of scales it has this smooth skin, like tinfoil, and if you rubbed it the silver would come onto your hand.' Mr Agnew snapped some images and sent them off to the University of Otago. ‘They got back to me very quickly to say it was an oarfish, which I had never heard of. It’s incredibly rare to see them in New Zealand.’ Samples of the deep sea fish, known to swim vertically as well self-amputate its own tail, were sent to see Otago Museum for testing . The bizarre deep sea creatures are known to swim vertically as well as eating sections of their own tail . The fish, which can grow to eleven metres in length, are are known to eat of sections of their own tail. Scientists have been unable to explain why they self-amputate, but some have proposed it is a form of protection. The frightening appearance of the fish means they have have been associated with various myths, including people mistaking them for sea-serpents. It has even been suggested that the Loch Ness Monster was an oarfish. The frightening appearance of the fish has led to some people mistaking them for mythical sea-serpents . Otago Museum later took tissue and organ samples of the elusive fish in a bid to find out what  caused it to be washed ashore. ‘Oarfish are typically often found hundreds of metres underwater. It’s likely this fish was moved here from a very strong current,’ Mr Agnew said.","The three-metre oarfish washed up on a salt marsh on the Otago Harbour .

"He may not be playing much at Manchester United but Anders Lindegaard certainly has a lot to smile about off the pitch as he enjoyed a spot of sunshine with stunning wife Misse Beqiri. Lindegaard tied the knot with the Swedish model last year in a romantic beach wedding in Mauritius. And the United goalkeeper, who has struggled for minutes throughout his career in Manchester, was keen to remind fans via his Instagram page of his marriage to stunning Beqiri. Manchester United goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard made the most of the English weather with Misse Beqiri . Lindegaard tied the knot with the stunning model last year and the couple have a son together .

"Lance Armstrong has said the World Anti-Doping Agency and others are 'owed an apology' from him for cheating during his cycling career - but noted that the agency's chief rebuffed efforts to meet back in 2013. David Howman, director general of WADA, said this week that he is disappointed Armstrong had not apologised for costly and time-consuming lawsuits before the former cycling champion admitted using performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong initially declined comment on Howman's remark, but on Wednesday provided the AP with a May 2013 email exchange with Howman, who initially indicted he could meet with Armstrong, then backed off under advice from WADA lawyers. Lance Armstrong admits groups such as WADA, USADA and others are owed an apology for his offences . WADA director general David Howman said this week that he was disappointed Armstrong hadn't apologised . 'I can talk at a suitable time and at a suitable place ... What do you suggest?' Howman responded to Armstrong's first inquiry about a meeting. A few days later, after Armstrong recounted his upcoming schedule, Howman broke off the discussion. 'Having reflected upon your request to meet with me, and having taken advice from our lawyers, it is apparent that it is a situation where little, if anything, can be gained from such a meeting,' Howman wrote Armstrong. Howman did not immediately respond Wednesday to requests for comment. Armstrong won the Tour de France every year from 1999-2005. Those titles were stripped after a massive report in 2012 by the US Anti-Doping Agency detailed doping by Armstrong and his US Postal Service teammates. In the email, Howman said he told Armstrong's attorneys months earlier they should meet with USADA. Although the intent of the meeting request with Howman is not relayed in emails, Armstrong said Wednesday he reached out to Howman in hopes of discussing a potential 'truth and reconciliation' effort to confront doping in cycling. Armstrong first declined comment on Howman's remark but then revealed his attempt to meet him in 2013 . Armstrong's agreement to take part in a Tour de France charity ride with former England footballer Geoff Thomas has caused controversy with some in cycling saying his presence at the event is disrespectful . A probe into the sport's doping problems was later conducted by the Cycling Independent Reform Commission, which met twice with Armstrong and issued its report in March. Part of the report detailed Armstrong's efforts to debunk a report by the French newspaper L'Equipe that found his urine samples from the 1999 Tour de France tested positive for EPO, a hormone that helps endurance. The UCI hired Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman to investigate the findings and the probe produced a report that Vrijman claimed exonerated Armstrong and instead blamed WADA and the testing lab. Amstrong holds up seven fingers, one for each of the Tour de France titles that were later stripped from him; and former UCI president Pat McQuaid at the 2012 press conference in Geneva that delivered his fate . The report released last month detailed how Armstrong's lawyers were allowed to help write the report that criticized WADA. Armstrong said he doesn't know if he would have apologised to Howman had they met in 2013, but it would have been a chance to do it in person. 'I was in a different headspace,' Armstrong said. 'There's no doubt that a lot of people like them, like USADA, are owed an apology.' Armstrong said there's been no attempt to meet with Howman since 2013.","WADA director general David Howman said he was disappointed the disgraced former cyclist hadn't yet apologised for drug offences .

"Hein Verbruggen, the controversial former head of international cycling, says he will fight any attempt to remove him as honorary president of the UCI after being criticised by the inquiry into the Lance Armstrong doping scandal. The Independent Commission for Reform in Cycling's (CIRC) report concluded that, under Verbruggen's leadership, the UCI had colluded with Armstrong to cover up allegations the seven-times Tour de France winner had doped. Verbruggen has now written to all UCI board members saying he has put the 'scandalously biased' report - which he also calls a 'character assassination' - into the hands of lawyers. Former head of international cycling Hein Verbruggen is unhappy with the CIRC report verdict . Verbruggen, pictured with Lance Armstrong in March 2003, has sent the CIRC report to Swiss lawyers . He also rejected a call from current UCI president Brian Cookson to resign his honorary presidency. In his letter, a copy of which has been seen by Press Association Sport, Verbruggen says: 'Mr Cookson is in for a surprise if he thinks that I will accept this scandalously biased CIRC report, and the same goes for taking away my honorary title. 'Indeed, the last word about the CIRC report has not yet been written. I would like to make you aware that I am having the report analysed by Swiss lawyers.' The lengthy letter added: 'It has become clear that what I am dealing with here is simply a personal revenge campaign against me by Mr Cookson.' Verbruggen also claims the 2.8million euros cost of the CIRC report has effectively been wasted. After the CIRC report was published in March, Cookson, said he would write to Verbruggen to ask him to step down as honorary president saying he had made 'serious errors of judgment and wrong decisions'. On Monday, Cookson said he would not get dragged into a public war of words with Verbruggen. He said: 'I think Mr Verbruggen's letter speaks for itself. Those who have read the CIRC report will understand where the UCI went wrong in the past, including the conflicts it needlessly got into and which seriously damaged its credibility. I was elected to change the way the UCI conducts itself and I won't be drawn into this kind of public conflict.'","Independent Commission for Reform in Cycling (CIRC) concluded that the UCI colluded with Lance Armstrong to cover up allegations .

"For a player known for his fearsome, fire-breathing nature in the centre of Arsenal’s midfield, who would protect goal like it was a pot of gold, it is fitting that he is preparing to be a football manager at Dragon Park. Patrick Vieira is set to complete his UEFA Pro Licence this summer leaving Manchester City’s Head of the Elite Development equipped for the top job. He has been taking his coaching badges with the Welsh Football Association under their technical director Osian Roberts. Given Manuel Pellegrini’s capitulation at City, the timing of their conclusion could not be better with Vieira itching for a chance to test himself amongst the best. Patrick Vieira has been part of the coaching team at Manchester City since he retired . Vieira worked as Football Development Executive at City before becoming reserve team manager . Vieira is one of the potential candidates in the frame to replace Manuel Pellegrini - if he were to leave . Under Premier League rules, there is nothing stopping Vieira taking charge now as they allow coaches without the full qualifications to take charge for 12 weeks. There is currently no real hurry, but in the coming months City’s top echelons will have some important decisions to make. Vieira’s contract at City is due to expire this summer and he is not prepared to hang around forever waiting for a chance at the helm. City’s teenagers are in awe of the man, having grown up watching him torment the Premier League for a decade at Arsenal and City and across Europe. Vieira played for Manchester City towards the end of his career after spells at Juventus and Inter Milan . Vieira was signed by former manager Roberto Mancini in 2011 . One of their brightest prospects on loan at Lille, Rony Lopes, told Sportsmail in an interview: ’It was like a dream just to meet someone like Vieira. For him to be the coach, it was the best thing in the world. From the first day, he was always very friendly, talking to me a lot, trying to pass on his knowledge and make me grow up as a player and a person. That was he wanted. He is very important to me. He keeps in touch with me, asking how I am.’ After a poor start to his time in charge of City’s young players they have made it to the UEFA Youth League quarter-finals for two successive seasons, enhancing Vieira’s reputation. Young Portuguese player Rony Lopes spoke highly of Vieira . The Frenchman also has allies in the first team, having played with Vincent Kompany and Joe Hart in his one season at the club in 2010/11. When Vieira joined City in a coaching capacity in June 2013 his aim was to see how he progressed in ‘the next few years,’ suggesting he is coming to a decision-making juncture in his career. He chose the Welsh FA and Roberts, who works alongside his deputy Carl Darlington, to complete his badges because the pair are known for developing individual coaches through their personality. Vieira is best remembered for the nine years he spent at Arsenal . Vieira made his name in England at Arsenal where he won seven major honours . Vieira has his own idea of how he wants to manage a side. ‘My coaching style is a combination from my experience of working with Arsene Wenger, Fabio Capello and Jose Mourinho,’ he told Sportsmail in an interview. ‘There is a little bit of all of them, plus my own experience to deliver my message. The relationship with the players is so important. I want to trust them but they must trust me, too. I like it because I want to be close with them. ‘ . In February he added another stellar manager to his list of influences when he spent time at Bayern Munich with Pep Guardiola and his backroom staff. City’s academy director Mark Allen described how he likes his sides to play: ‘We play out from the back, through the thirds, into midfield and then a possession-based game but with fast, attacking play. We want to keep the ball, have full-backs bombing on and work on a very fast recovery. Press, press, press and play again.'","Patrick Vieira set to complete his UEFA Pro Licence this summer .

"Manchester United have been brilliant in the second half of the season but the defeat at Everton was a timely reminder that they still have a long way to go. United played like Sunderland on a bad day – they were that horrendous. Recently I wrote about what United need to take them back to a proper challenge for domestic and European glory. Now it's time to name names. Teams will have bad days, of course. It's no surprise to those of us who can see his quality and importance to United, but without Michael Carrick they look far more beatable. I can't see how Everton score that first goal if Carrick is on the pitch. Louis van Gaal needs some big signings in the summer to turn Manchester United into title contenders . Borussia Dortmund's midfield pair of Ilkay Gundogan (left) and Sven Bender (right) fit the bill . Daley Blind is a poverty-stricken pauper's version of Carrick in that position. The Dutchman is a slower version of the Geordie, which is quite an achievement, and so more reinforcements are needed. That's why it would be a good idea for United to raid Borussia Dortmund. Ilkay Gundogan has already been linked with a move to Old Trafford – it's a no-brainer. This player is physical yet graceful. He can spot a pass and execute it first time. He's dynamic and never hides. Alongside him in that Dortmund midfield is Sven Bender - the German Carrick. These players make relatively few tackles because they anticipate and intercept – they read the game. Daley Blind struggled to cope in Manchester United's midfield during their 3-0 defeat by Everton . David de Gea, Blind and Ashley Young react after conceding a goal in a big defeat by Everton on Sunday . But when Bender tackles, the opponent knows about it – he is a beast. Despite his frame (he's 6ft 1in, slightly shorter than Carrick), he is quick to step into a tackle. Opponents think they have a bit of time on the ball but Bender makes up the ground in a flash to rob them. What I'm saying here is that United may need two players to replace Carrick. And those two fit the bill. Both are winners, both have had years in Dortmund playing some magnificent football. And if Louis van Gaal is raiding Dortmund he might as well sign Armenia's finest Henrikh Mkhitaryan. What a playmaker this guy is – he floats around picking the ball up wherever he can, gets the team into advanced positions and can spot a pass. He can score goals too. Manchester United look far more vulnerable without Michael Carrick in their midfield . Armenian creative threat Henrikh Mkhitaryan has been linked with a move to the Premier League before . Gundogan, like Bender, could be leaving Dortmund this summer along with departing manager Jurgen Klopp . I think he's a more positive version of Juan Mata – look how often the Spaniard gave the ball away at Goodison on Sunday. There's a lot to admire about Mata's game, but he is one of the guilty ones when you look at the reasons for United being ponderous in their build-up. United also need a centre half and another striker – it's a work in progress after the post-Fergie collapse. But the Dortmund trio would bring instant reward for Van Gaal. And it's not just plucking names out of nowhere: the timing is right for them to move on just as manager Jurgen Klopp leaves. There is a way any Manchester United team must play – David Moyes found that out to his cost, and earlier this season Van Gaal listened to the fans' loud and clear disapproval of negative football and passes going backwards too often and changed the way they played. Hoofing it up to Marouane Fellaini has happened – not as often as the critics make out – but with certain players out, Van Gaal has felt that tactic is the best way to get results. Van Gaal knows anything less than a top-four finish is failure. Juan Mata was wasteful in possession against Everton at Goodison Park on Sunday . Mkhitaryan (right) challenges Eintracht Frankfurt's Carlos Zambrano during a Bundesliga game . Marouane Fellaini's rebirth has been a big factor in Manchester United's excellent form over the past weeks . So much has been made of Dortmund's poor season, but even during that time they managed to finish top of their Champions League group above Arsenal. And the second half of the campaign has seen a revival that has led them to the top half when before Christmas relegation looked a possibility. These are not bad players just because of half a season. These are players who, if they successfully bring their A game with them from Germany, could improve United's starting XI massively. If United are going to raid a club for good players, there are some rich pickings at Dortmund. And I haven't even mentioned Mats Hummels.","Defeat by Everton showed that Manchester United have a long way to go .

"There is a rich and mildly amusing irony about Arsenal fans calling Chelsea boring for defending well, when these Gooners still celebrate a side that ground out results just to preserve their unbeaten record in 2003-04. They drew four of their last seven, the lifeless goalless stalemate at home to Birmingham a particular highlight. Instead of giving a shallow critique fuelled by sour grapes on Chelsea's title winners, maybe those fans should focus on the shortcomings of their own players, and in particular Mesut Ozil. Mesut Ozil has been sublime in recent weeks but he didn't do enough against Chelsea on Sunday . The German, celebrating the FA Cup win over Reading, needs to start performing to live up to his £42m tag . I've enjoyed some of Ozil's recent performances, he's been sublime more than spectacular, but he's definitely been a joy to watch. And so as I sat down to watch Arsenal face Chelsea, I felt confident that Ozil could be the difference between the two teams. I also felt that Arsenal could win the game, and win it well. And that if they did win it well, it would put huge pressure on Chelsea in the run-in. I felt there would be a chance that a big result for Arsenal at the Emirates on Sunday might just open the title door for the Gunners. But it wasn't to be. And come the big moment, the big player fluffed his lines. Ozil wasn't terrible but he didn't impact the game enough. While Cesc Fabregas was sending a killer pass only for Oscar to be wiped out by the goalkeeper (how is that not a penalty?), and Willian carved Arsenal up with the pass of the match to gift a great chance to Ramires,  Ozil was tidy, nothing more. Cesc Fabregas outshone Ozil on Sunday as Chelsea showed why they are ahead of Arsenal this season . Fabregas, who left the Emirates pitch with Ozil's shirt, would have been better than the German for Arsenal . Ozil takes on Cesar Azpilicueta in a game where he was fine, but not good enough to change the result . He didn't stand out. He didn't impact the game enough to affect the result. He didn't show any signs of being world class, or worth £42million. And then when he had the chance to be the match winner, Ozil completely missed his kick with the goal gaping right in front of him. Poor technique. In the second half Chelsea played into Ozil's hands. They effectively gave him the ball and asked him what he could do. If he's as good as he's purported to be, he kills off Chelsea with his ability on the ball. But he couldn't create the winning goal. For all of Arsenal's pivotal, meaningful, must-win games in the last two seasons, Ozil has looked average. Even in the FA Cup final last year it was Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey who stood out, while Ozil failed to shine, complaining afterwards he was tired after his first season in English football. He was the most expensive player on the pitch on Sunday and come the end of his Arsenal career he will be judged on his impact. Ozil could go down the same route as Juan Sebastian Veron (left) and Andriy Shevchenko . When Thierry Henry says Arsenal need a new spine of their team, it's time to start listening . A player with a huge reputation signed for such a huge amount has to be more than just sublime. He has to have a major impact in the big games, he has to take the team to another level. Two seasons have gone and Ozil has failed to do that at Arsenal. There are other big signings with big reputations who have flopped in the Premier League – Andriy Shevchenko, Fernando Torres, Juan Sebastian Veron, and we're still waiting for the biggest of them all – Angel di Maria - to show us what he can do. Ozil could be joining that list unless he delivers something amazing next season. When an Arsenal legend like Thierry Henry points out that after all this time Arsene Wenger has constructed a team without a spine – Henry said they need a goalkeeper, a centre half, a defensive midfielder, and a top striker – you have to listen. He's right of course, but the knock-on effect is that the top players Arsenal have in their team need to deliver something extra special. And Ozil has failed to do that. In one of the biggest games of Arsenal's season, Ozil missed his kick when a late opportunity came his way . Arsenal fans are defensive of the Germany midfielder but that is merely a sign of their low expectations . Henry said what all Arsenal fans know, but most refuse to admit – Fabregas would have had a bigger impact in that team this season than Ozil has. There's a lot of goodwill from Arsenal fans towards  Ozil – they want him to be the hero, they want him to be their superstar. And that desperation means some have over-praised his performances. They're hoping it's some kind of twisted self-fulfilling prophecy – if they keep saying Ozil is brilliant, then maybe he will be. Witness this tweet about Ozil from Arsenal fan @girlgooner two weeks ago: 'I still can't believe he plays for my team Arsenal, I think we are very lucky, he's a very special player.' It seems you only have to sign for Arsenal these days to be a legend. That's how well Wenger has managed and manipulated standards and expectations at this once great football club. As for Ozil, he's been good. But he needs to be brilliant.","Mesut Ozil failed to deliver against Chelsea despite a perfect opportunity .

"The boss of supermarket Sainsbury's has been sentenced in his absence to two years in Egyptian jail over the company's disastrous venture into the Middle East 16 years ago. Chief executive Mike Coupe, 53, was convicted of embezzlement last September after former Sansbury's business partner Amr el-Nasharty accused him of trying to illegally seize cheques. Now a court has sentenced him to two years behind bars for the crime, which relates to Sainbury's joint venture with local supermarket chain Edge, owned by Mr el-Nasharty . Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, has been sentenced to two years in an Egyptian jail after a former business partner of the British supermarket claimed Mr Coupe tried to seize money from him . Mr Coupe is believed to have travelled to the Middle Eastern country last Sunday to appeal the conviction, which dates back to a time when he didn't work at the firm, but this was unsuccessful, reports The Times. In 1999, Sainsbury's, then under the stewardship of David Bremner, opened its first store in Cairo, hoping to capitalise on a growing Arabic middle class which was still largely reliant on corner shops for their groceries. Sainsbury's opened its first store in Egypt in Cario in 1999, hoping to capitalise on a growing middle class that were still largely reliant on corner shops for groceries. The company initially spent £10million on 25 per cent share in local firm Edge, owned by businessman Amr el-Nasharty. Six months later they spent another £40million buying an 80 per cent share, and by 2001 had built 100 stores, employing more than 2,500 staff. But, during a Palestinian uprising in the region, Sainbury's found itself added to a 'boycott list' of largely American companies accused of having ties with Israel. It was believed at the time that this could have been the result of shopkeepers fearing for their business who asked local Imams to preach against the chain. This lead to stores being attacked by rioters armed with bricks and bats. When Sainsbury's eventually withdrew from Egypt in 2001, losing £110million, the company blamed a 'deterioration of the trading environment', widely believed to be a reference to the fatwa. Over the course of three years, the company invested nearly £100million opening more than 100 stores across the country, employing 2,500 staff. Despite raking in sales of almost £80million by 2001, the business made an overall loss of almost £35million, due in part to being placed on a religious boycott list over alleged links with Israel. Sainsbury's quit Egypt later that year, losing almost £110million in the process, and selling the business back to Mr el-Nasharty. However, he then filed a suit against Sainsbury's, claiming they had sold him an insolvent business with large tax debts which he could not repay. Sainsbury's countered this claim, alleging that Mr el-Nasharty had paid for the business with cheques that later bounced. Mr el-Nasharty then went on to claim that Mr Coupe travelled to Egypt shortly after being appointed CEO last July and attempted to seize money from him, breaching Egypt's bankruptcy laws. Mr Coupe was automatically convicted of the charge last September after 'failing to attend court hearings', though a spokesman for Sainsbury's said the business was not told these were taking place. The spokesman added that Mr Coupe denies all the allegations against him, which they say has 'nothing to do with Mr Coupe'. Mr Coupe was born in Watford in 1960, the son of a housewife and inventor father who founded his own medical company, he was brought up in West Sussex. He then went on to study physics at Birmingham University before 'stumbling' into supermarket management via a graduate training scheme. He began his career at super-brand Unilever before moving on to Tesco, and then Asda where he was the boss of Justin King, the former Sainsbury's CEO who he succeeded. He was appointed CEO of Sainsbury's last July on an estimated £900,000 salary. He currently lives in a £1million terraced house in York with Jill, his wife of 22 years, and their two daughters. A statement issued by the company said: 'We strongly refute the legal case in Egypt brought against our chief executive Mike Coupe. 'This relates to a historic commercial dispute in which Mr Coupe had no involvement. 'Mike was not even employed by Sainsbury's at the time of the original business deal in 2001 which gave rise to these legal proceedings and has never met the complainant Mr el-Nasharty. Sainsbury's went into business with Amr el-Nasharty in 1999, eventually purchasing 80 per cent of chain Edge in order to open 100 supermarkets across Egypt, with the first being built in Cario (pictured) In 2001 the British chain withdrew from the loss-making Middle Eastern market, selling its shares back to Mr el-Nasharty, who complained the business was insolvent, beginning a 16-year legal fight . 'Mr el-Nasharty has consistently made false claims against Sainsbury's and individuals within the business over the years, all of which have been unsuccessful. 'When Mr el-Nasharty bought the Egyptian business back from us in 2001, he paid us with cheques that bounced. Mr el-Nasharty is now claiming that Mike Coupe was in Egypt in July 2014 and tried to seize these cheques. This is clearly ridiculous. 'Mike Coupe was in London carrying out his normal duties that day. Mike Coupe was tried in absentia by an Egyptian court, without prior notice that he needed to attend, and we are contesting these groundless allegations.' Sainsbury's added that the case was being handled by its legal team and said: 'We do not anticipate it having any material operational or financial impact on the company.' The Times said Mr el-Nasharty had declined to comment. Sainsbury's, the UK's third biggest supermarket, is due to report full-year results next week.","Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe handed two year  jail term by Egyptian court .

"Legendary Barcelona captain Carles Puyol is believed to be training with a view to ending his retirement from football for a lucrative end-of-career spell in Qatar or the United States. Puyol won six La Liga titles and enjoyed three Champions League wins at Barca and is considered to be one of the finest defenders of his generation having been named in UEFA's European team of the year six times across a trophy-laden career. The 36-year-old retired last May after 15 years at his boyhood club having struggled to return from a persistent knee injury, but now reports claim he could be set for a return to playing with New York City or Al-Sadd after returning to training. Barcelona legend Carles Puyol is said to be training ahead of a return to playing in either the US or Qatar . The 36-year-old retired last May after struggling to return from a persistent knee injury that had troubled him . If the reports from Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo prove true, Puyol could join up with Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard in the States or with his former long-term team-mate Xavi, who is expected to move to Qatar with Al-Sadd. The curly-haired centre back had hinted on his retirement that he would consider a return to the game had it not been for the knee injury that plagued the tail-end of his career. 'I don't think I'll be a coach, it's not what I'd like most,' Puyol said in May. 'Maybe I'll change my mind but for now I want to do other things.' Puyol, seen here with Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar al-Baker, could move to the Middle East . Xavi, Puyol's former team-mate, is said to considering a move to Al-Sadd and Puyol could join him there . David Villa is now playing for New York City. Frank Lampard will join him soon and Puyol could be next . The former Barca skipper was named as the club's assistant director of football but he left that role in January when Andoni Zubizarreta, his senior, was fired. Xavi visited Qatar in the last international break ahead of a rumoured move at the end of his Barcelona contract which would see the midfield metronome earn around £7million-a-year, and Puyol could choose a similar route. Alternatively, a New York move would see Puyol join the City Football Group alongside Chelsea legend Lampard and another former team-mate of Puyol's, David Villa.","Former Barcelona centre back Carles Puyol retired in May last year .

"This incredible video shows the stomach-churning moment a man performed surgery on himself at the top of the mountain using items from his first aid kit. The Russian man, who was filming a documentary in snow-covered mountains, found himself injured and unable to continue the ascent. It is believed the man, whose nickname is 'Che', was struck by a huge falling icicle, causing a collection of blood under the skin called a haemotoma. The blood formed a clot which caused a huge swelling and bruising, leaving him in pain and unable to walk. Scroll down for video: VIEWERS MUST BE AWARE THE FOOTAGE CONTAINS EXTREMELY GRAPHIC CONTENT . A Russian hiker performed surgery on himself at the top of some snow-covered mountains using only items in his first aid kit . The man was struck by a falling icicle (he is pictured pointing to it with his stick) which caused a blood clot and a swelling in his leg which left him unable to walk . In order to get back down to the city at the foot of the mountains, he decided to perform surgery on himself while lying in the snow. Speaking in Russian in the video, he said: ‘If you mountain climb, fish or hunt, you must be ready for difficulties and think of safety. 'The insignificant trauma can cause serious problems if you don’t take the right actions.’ Carrying out the operation - with some surgical instruments he had in his backpack - was ‘the most reasonable and effective action’, he said. Viewers must be aware the footage contains extremely graphic content. First, he decides to use snow as an anaesthetic, and rubs it on his leg to numb the injury. Then, he burns a scalpel on a gas torch in order to make it sterile. ‘Now it is possible to start the operation,’ he explains in the video. In the original film, which has been edited by MailOnline, the man is seen making a deep incision into his leg with a scalpel, and blood is seen flowing out. He reaches into the cut with his fingers and scoops out the coagulated blood – almost black in colour – which had formed into a clot. With no sign of pain – or any emotion at all – he says: ‘As you can see here it isn’t necessary for special anaesthesia, snow perfectly coped with this task.’ He cleans away all the clotted blood, until fresh, red blood is seen. He then pours hydrogen peroxide on the wound to clean it, which fizzes and clears away the blood. Hydrogen peroxide is commonly used as an antiseptic. The man decided to perform a procedure to remove the blood clot himself, rubbing snow on his leg as an anaesthetic . He used items in his first aid kit which included a gas lamp, a scalpel, surgical string, a needle holder and a curved needle as well as a hydrogen peroxide antiseptic . ‘We consider that a tiny wound, we will sew it up now,’ he said after wiping the cut clean with a tissue. Using some surgical string, a needle holder and a curved needle, he then sews up the wound, creating large, rustic-looking stitches. Once again, he comments on how remarkably unpainful the whole procedure has been. ‘It is worth noticing that anaesthesia by means of snow is very effective. Pain isn’t felt,’ he tells the camera. Wrapping a bandage around the wound, he stamps his leg on the snow to indicate he can walk again. ‘Operation is finished,’ he declares. He cuts a deep incision in his own leg using a scalpel, which he sterilised by heating it with a gas lamp . Using his own hands he scoops out blood which has coagulated and formed a clot, before sewing the wound up with surgical string . Incredibly, ten days later the seams were removed and the wound healed completely, leaving barely any scar . Two weeks later, he is seen casually sitting on an armchair in the snow, having completely recovered. ‘I didn’t die of gangrene,’ he exclaims, adding that wound did not become infected and there was no need to discharge any pus from it. Incredibly, the seams were removed in ten days and the wound healed completely. The camera pans in on his leg and, amazingly, he was left with barely any scar. While others may have waxed lyrical about their ordeal, his concluding thoughts are that it is essential to have a surgical needle in one’s backpack. ‘It is possible to use a sharp penknife instead of a scalpel and flat nose pliers instead of a needle-holder,’ he said. ‘But unfortunately it is difficult to replace a surgical needle with something else so I advise having it in the first-aid kit.’","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Can Rickie Lambert sue for restraint of trade? Brendan Rodgers has killed off Lambert's career and you've got to feel sorry for the player. You can't blame him for joining Liverpool – why would he turn that down? At the time he was a confident striker – playing regularly in the Premier League and scoring goals for Southampton. He'd just been to a World Cup. Rickie Lambert has scarcely been given a chance since joining Liverpool despite their striking problems . Brendan Rodgers' decision to ignore Lambert, in favour of Mario Balotelli, is completely illogical . This time last year Lambert was about to play at a World Cup for England but his stock has fallen since . For Rodgers to ignore him when they have desperately needed goals is illogical. I'm well aware Lambert isn't Luis Suarez, I know he's not a world-class striker. Lambert missed out on Saturday at West Brom because of a hip injury but it must have been gutting for him to see Mario Balotelli get yet another chance. The England striker played 90 minutes 20 times last season, made 31 starts, and unlike any Liverpool player in the scoring charts this season, easily got into double figures. Contrast that with this campaign when in terms of Premier League minutes on the pitch Lambert has played the equivalent of roughly six-and-a-half games. Lambert has enjoyed the opportunity to score for his boyhood team but he deserves more football . When he has started in the Premier League or Champions League, Lambert and Liverpool have impressed . On his first Premier League start for Liverpool he scored, and when he played 90 minutes in four consecutive games he scored in the first game, Liverpool won the next two, and drew the fourth. And then he was dropped again and hasn't started since. Meanwhile, Balotelli regularly gets more time on the pitch, and regularly fails to deliver. He has to go down as Liverpool's worst-ever signing – at least the club won a trophy when Andy Carroll was at Anfield. How come Balotelli got more time on the pitch at Wembley last weekend than Lambert? And what about Saturday? Balotelli was hopeless yet again. Whether you watch his performance or check the stats, he was useless – not for the first time this season. Ultimately it'd be wrong to suggest Lambert was going to be the man to spearhead Liverpool's charge to the title and a Champions League challenge. But to be so underused in a season when Daniel Sturridge has been missing for so long, and Balotelli has been ineffective, is inexplicable. Balotelli, no matter which way you look at it, has been useless, and Lambert should be picked ahead of him . Balotelli was given more time on the pitch than Lambert in Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Villa . Lambert scored 20 goals for Southampton - he may not be world class, but he is better than the alternatives . Lambert should have joined Aston Villa in January. But he found out about the move just a few hours before the transfer window closed and chose to stay. Rodgers told Lambert that he didn't want him to go. Why say that and then not bother using him? Nobody can ever take away the fact that Lambert has scored for his boyhood club Liverpool in the Premier League and the Champions League. And Lambert is the kind of guy who will treasure those special moments and keep them close to his heart. But he's lost his England place and his reputation as a Premier League striker has been seriously undermined by Rodgers and Liverpool this season.","Rickie Lambert has barely played since joining from Southampton .

"You could soon unlock your phone simply by holding it up to the side of your face. Researchers have created a sensor that can recognise the unique shape of your ear, your palm or any other body part you want to use to access your device. Called Bodyprint, the technology turns a standard touchscreen into a biometric scanner removing the need to specialist hardware such as fingerprint readers or infrared cameras. Scroll down for video . Researchers at Yahoo Labs in California have created a sensor that can recognise the shape of your ear or any other body part you want to access your device (shown) Bodyprint was devised by Christian Holz, Senaka Buthpitiya, and Marius Knaust from the California-based Yahoo Labs. Details of its algorithm are included in their paper, Bodyprint: Biometric User Identification on Mobile Devices Using the Capacitive Touchscreen to Scan Body Parts. The Salt card is designed to end the tiresome task of manually unlocking a smartphone or tablet by automatically making it come to life whenever the user is nearby. The credit card-sized gadget also locks devices again as soon as a user moves out of range at a distance of ten feet (three metres). Salt connects to an app on a user’s Android handset or iPhone via Bluetooth and also tells them if they have strayed too far from their wallet, where the firm suggests the Salt card is stored. The card was created by Illinois-based duo Joel Paglione and Niko Zistakis.. They claim it will save people around 53 hours over a year, based on the belief that the average phone user unlocks their phone 150 times a day. 'Recent mobile phones integrate fingerprint scanners to authenticate users biometrically and replace passwords, making authentication more convenient for users,' explained the researchers. 'However, due to their cost, capacitive fingerprint scanners have been limited to top-of-the-line phones, a result of the required resolution and quality of the sensor.' They continued that while the input resolution of a touchscreen is around six dots per inch (dpi) - meaning it can't capture the level of detail in a fingerprint - the surface area is larger than a more advanced reader. This allows the touch sensor 'to scan users’ body parts, such as ears, fingers, fists, and palms by pressing them against the display.' To accept an incoming call, users would only need to press their ear against the phone. During tests with 12 participants, Bodyprint classified body parts with 99.98 per cent accuracy and identified users with 99.52 per cent accuracy. This accuracy was highest when scanning the ear due to its more unique shape and size. It’s not just ears that could be used for identification – your first, phalanges (in your fingers), palm or just your fingertips could also be used (shown). This means that just gripping the phone could unlock it for you . A video demonstrating the technology revealed Bioprint can also be used to add multiple users to a single device. So, for example, if something required dual identification then both people could provide it. It’s not just ears that could be used for identification - your fist, phalanges (in your fingers), palm or your fingertips could also be used. This means that just gripping the phone could unlock it for you. There's no news yet on when the feature might be made available to manufacturers, but the team says their next step is to continue testing. To accept an incoming call, users would only need to press their ear against the phone (example shown). During tests with 12 participants, Bodyprint classified body parts with 99.98 per cent accuracy and identified users with 99.52 per cent accuracy .","Yahoo Labs in California reveals new method to unlock your phone .

"Never mind John Prescott's 'Two Jags'. Thrifty motorists whose budgets won't stretch to the favourite luxury car of the Labour peer might consider 'two dragons' instead. For Korea's SsangYong is launching a new sports utility vehicle from under £13,000 that promises value for money motoring for drivers who believe in watching their pennies. But SsangYong (Korean for 'two dragons') has given its new sporty five-door family runaround a very European name - Tivoli - after the stylish Italian town near Rome, home to the Villa d'Este, a Unesco world heritage site famed for its Renaissance architecture and garden. SsangYong (Korean for 'two dragons') is launching a value for money sports utility vehicle . Pitched to take on the pumpedup Nissan Juke, the Tivoli SUV is powered by 1.6 litre Euro 6 petrol and diesel engines with six speed manual and automatic transmissions. It arrives in the UK this summer in three trim levels - SE, EX, ELX - with a choice of front-wheel drive or 'intelligent' 4x4 and seven airbags across the range. There's also a five-year unlimited mileage warranty. The entry level SE, from £12,950, is finished in grey cloth trim and includes 16-in alloys, cruise control, a petrol stop/go system, seven airbags and 'smart' steering with normal, comfort and sport modes. The top-of-the-range ELX, from £16,000 to £19,000, comes fully loaded with a choice of the full range of engines and gearboxes plus diamond cut alloy wheels, smart keyless starting, front and rear parking sensors, privacy glass, rear spoiler, automatic headlamps, rain sensing wipers, TomTom navigation system with 7 in touch screen and a rear-view camera. There is a choice of six exterior colours, and even a 'My Tivoli' personalisation programme which allows customers to create their own distinctive car. This includes the styling pack (£400) which gives a choice of five two-tone roof combinations, plus further engine and drivetrain options. As well as offering lots of interior seating and storage space, it aims to offer driver and passengers easy connectivity to their IT devices. SssangYong's UK sales and marketing director Steve Gray expects it to double the firm's annual UK sales from 2,000 to 4,000 a year. UK chief executive Paul Williams says: 'This is a car that will really put SsangYong on the map and change perceptions.' Citroen's Aircross model (above) has protective alloy bumps front and side . Motorists of a certain age may recall those fondly remembered TV adverts from childhood for rufty-tufty Tonka Toys. These were virtually indestructible metal cars - usually 4x4s or trucks with massive wheels. The TV advert informed viewers: 'They build real tough toys, for real tough boys - Tonka!' Well, Citroen seems to have taken its inspiration from them for its Aircross model (above). It even has protective alloy bumps front and side made from honeycomb aluminium castings surrounded by hard rubber. Billed as a big brother to the current Citroen C4 Cactus, it was shown in prototype hybrid form at the Shanghai Motor Show in China. Citroen's global boss, Briton Linda Jackson, says her company has to regain the sort of design flair that created the 2CV: 'If we want stand-out cars, then we have to be bold.' The prototype has a 1.6 litre petrol engine linked to an electric motor combining to create 313bhp. Citroen claims a special boost function will help it accelerate from rest to 62mph in 4.5 seconds. Don't hold your breath. But many do see it as France's answer to Britain's new Land Rover Discovery Sport. Ii is almost time for the next Goodwood Festival of Speed.

"You probably won’t realise they are coming until it’s too late. Tiny robots, the size of an A4 sheet, are being programmed to lift cars that are up to two tonnes in weight. Working together, these creepy machines are able to sneak up unnoticed and silently remove their target from the scene. Tiny robots, the size of an A4 sheet, are being programmed to lift cars that are up to two tons in weight . The robots, collectively called Avert, are the creation of a European consortium led by the Democritus University of Thrace in Greece. A ‘Autonomous Multi-Robot System for Vehicle Extraction and Transportation’ (Avert)  computer first selects a vehicle to be moved after cameras have mapping the area in detail. The Avert system then works by sending a deployment unit to scan the area again and identify new potential obstacles. Once this has been done, bogies deploy from the depolyment unit and are tracked to a target vehicle, where they dock onto the wheels and lift the car. The robots, collectively called Avert, are the creation of a European consortium led by the Democritus University of Thrace in Greece . These bogies are fitted with on-board sensors, including two lasers and a digital camera. The sensors help the Avert tool move the vehicle without human intervention, while avoiding obstacles. While the system may seem creepy, it could have important applications for bomb disposal teams. Researchers envisage the system being used by the police to remove suspicious vehicles, potentially rigged with explosives, from within buildings. ‘Current methods of bomb disruption and neutralisation are hindered in the event that the device is shielded, blocked or for whatever reason cannot be accessed for examination,’ the researcher wrote on their site. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich revealed a terrifying glimpse of the future - a swarm of robot spiders . Intel has shown of a terrifying glimpse of the future - a swarm of robot spiders that can be controlled with a flick of the wrist. At the chip giant's developers forum in China, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich revealed the demonstration to show off the firm's button sized computed and controller wristband. He was able to cause lights on the robots to change shape, and control their movement from the bans. The robots were powered by Curie, a computer the size of a button developed by Intel. 'The Intel Curie module is a tiny hardware product based on the Intel Quark SE system chip, which is the company's first purpose-built system on a chip for wearable devices,' the firm said. It contains Bluetooth low-energy radio, sensors and battery charging technologies. Krzanich said that there's a dedicated sensor hub processor and pattern classification engine that allows it, for example, to identify different sporting activities quickly and precisely. ‘Avert can provide an autonomous capability to remove blocking vehicles which is not currently available.’ Other uses could include removing cars parked in a tight spot or helping vehicles move within a car park without a driver. The team has been working on the technology since 2012 and believes a production model could be ready by next year. They will be showcasing the system at the upcoming International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA2015) on May 26th to 30th in Seattle.

The cargo ship also is delivering a copy of the Banner of Victory, the banner raised over the Reichstag in Berlin by victorious Soviet soldiers in 1945. Russia is planning extensive celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Nasa is now having to rely on a single cargo shipper, SpaceX. Its other supplier, Orbital Sciences, is still grounded following a launch explosion last October at Virginia. The potential loss of an entire load of supplies on Progress is a serious blow to the International Space Station. The cargo ship launched this morning on a Soyuz 2-1A rocket (pictured).  Progress is carrying about 2.5 tons of cargo, including fuel, equipment, oxygen and food, to the space station, which currently has a six-person crew from Russia, the United States and Italy .","Progress M-27M suffered a glitch moments after launch this morning .

"While the 3pm slump has most of us reaching for a chocolate bar, the sugar crash that comes afterwards, and the guilt, can ruin the enjoyment. But chocoholics can now get their fix guilt-free, as a raw foodie has developed healthy spins on all the classic chocolate bars. Taline Gabrielian, 33, of Sydney's Northern Beaches has recreated the entire range of chocolate bar favourites, including Mars Bars, Snickers, Bounty, Twix and Cherry Ripe, and published the recipes through her best-selling food app, Hippie Lane. Scroll down for the recipe . Mars mania: Fans of the Mars Bar can now enjoy the guilt-free version, with raw recipes by Taline Gabrielian . Choc-full of goodness: No need to count calories or sneaky this Mars Bar, it's sugar-free, vegan and dairy-free . With 129,000 Instagram followers and the Hippie Lane app consistently sitting in the top three of 'most popular food and drink' apps on iTunes since its release in January, Gabrielian attributes all her  success to the re-imagining of sweet tooth favourites. 'It was definitely my tactic. I thought the best way to grow the business and inspire a healthy lifestyle was to offer people something they understand, that looks and tastes like the real deal,' the mother of two told Daily Mail Australia. Gabrielian, who began stocking raw treats in local cafes and photographing them, only realised the serious demand for her sweet treats when she reached 80,000 followers within a year. Healthy hippy: Taline Gabrielian said her choc bars satisfy her, even though she grew up on Nutella and Milo . Twix treats: 'I always crave something after dinner, so these Twix bars still give me the same satisfaction' 'They just loved  that I was portraying healthy versions of the chocolates they knew and loved. They were commenting saying ""does it really taste like a Mars Bar?,"" and basically just wanted a piece of the pie,' she said. While her app has 50 recipes in total, the classic top five favourite bars are by far her most popular, according to Gabriel. But she says her mint slice, caramel and choc cheesecake are also go down a treat too. While the chocolates are all classified as raw, vegan, refined sugar-free and dairy-free, Gabriel assured DMA that this in no way means 'fun or taste-free', people are sold by her recipes. Cherry on top: Gabriel recreated the classic cherry ripe bar for those who like a fruity take on chocolate . 'I began competitions early on (on her Instagram) to remake my treats and convince them it's the real deal and the recipes work. And they loved them, saying 'this is the best peppermint slice I've ever tried and knocking on my door wanting more.' Gabriel shares her top substitutes to eat healthy sweet treats... 1. Swap sugar for... rice malt syrup . 'It's derived from brown rice and is milled down until it becomes syrup.' 2. Swap caramel for... nut butters . 'I will mix almond butter with tahini, coconut oil and dates.' 3. Swap flour for... nut meal . 'When making a biscuit base I like to use a mix of walnuts and almond meal' 4. Swap chocolate for... cacao powder . 'I make chocolate by mixing cacao powder, coconut oil and maple syrup.' 5. Swap butter for... coconut oil . As a self-proclaimed chocoholic who grew up on a diet of Milo and Nutella, Gabriel knows what those with a sweet tooth expect, but ever since she converted to healthy versions, she's never looked back. 'I always crave something after lunch or dinner, I get a sugar rush - we all need it. But I still get the same feeling having one of my Twix bars.' 'Once  in blue moon I will try a  normal chocolate bar again and it’s sickly sweet. But once you cut all the bad sweets and find healthy replacements there's no reason to go back.' For Gabriel, her main criterion for all her chocolate bars are that they are beautiful tasting, using simple ingredients,easy to make, familiar to her followers and have a 'feel good' taste factor. New to the raw baking scene? Rest assured, Gabriel said all her recipes are easy - all it requires is stocking up on a pantry of new ingredients. While she admits some of the recommended  swaps like coconut oil, rice malt syrup and cacao can be expensive to begin with, once you have them, they will be on high rotation - so you get your money's worth.

"A man has been arrested for stealing Elton John's iconic heart-shaped glasses from a Memphis museum. Matthew Colvin, 26, was behind bars on Tuesday in Southhaven, Mississippi, and  will be extradited back to Memphis on Wednesday. The Rock 'n' Soul Museum reported on April 21 that an employee discovered the glasses, valued at more than $2,000, had been taken out of a display case during business hours. Scroll down for video . A pair of heart-shaped glasses belonging to Elton John have been found in a mailbox after they were stolen from the Memphis Rock n' Soul Museum in Tennessee last week . Elton John pictured in another pair of heart-shaped glasses in a music video for Don't Go Breaking My Heart (accompanied by Minnie Mouse) Matthew Colvin, 26, was behind bars on Tuesday in Southhaven, Mississippi, and will be extradited back to Memphis on Wednesday . An investigator lifted prints and matched them to Colvin, WMC-TV reported. Police said on Tuesday that investigators called Colvin on Monday and he told them where the glasses were. They were able to retrieve them from a mailbox. Colvin faces up to 12 years in prison for the theft. The glasses were to be put back on display on Wednesday. Flamboyant glasses and outfits have been part of Elton John's signature look. He wore another pair of pink heart-shaped glasses in a music video for Don't Go Breaking My Heart - where he was accompanied by Minnie Mouse instead of Kiki Dee. Museum executive director John Doyle said at the time of the theft that the case showed no signs of being forced open, and that a special screwdriver was needed to open the box. The glasses are on loan to the museum from a private owner, and had been on display for the past few months as part of an exhibit on 60 years of rock. A guitar used by Elvis, a gown worn by Whitney Houston and a Three 6 Mafia hooded sweatshirt were among the other items on display next to the Rocket Man's shades. In the 15 years that it has been open, the Rock n' Soul Museum has not experienced a theft. The glasses were insured for up to $2,000. The director of the Rock n' Soul Museum said the case sustained no damage in the theft which he suspected was done with a special screwdriver .","Matthew Colvin, 26, was behind bars on Tuesday in Southhaven, Mississippi, and will be extradited back to Memphis on Wednesday .

"If you’re fed up with repeatedly typing passwords, hovering your finger on a sensor or staring at your phone waiting for it to scan your face to unlock it, a new device could cure your woes. The Salt card is designed to end the tiresome task of manually unlocking a smartphone or tablet by automatically making it come to life whenever the user is nearby. The credit card-sized gadget also locks devices again as soon as a user moves out of range at a distance of 10 feet (three metres). Scroll down for video . Convenient: The Salt card (pictured) is designed to end the tiresome task of manually unlocking a smartphone or tablet, by automatically unlocking it whenever the user is nearby . Salt connects to an app on a user’s Android handset or iPhone via Bluetooth and also tells them if they have strayed too far from their wallet, where the firm suggests the Salt card is stored. The card was created by Joel Paglione and Niko Zistakis.. They claim it will save people around 53 hours over a year, based on the belief that the average phone user unlocks their phone 150 times a day. The duo, based in Chicago, Illinois, came up with the idea as an increased method of security and a time-saving device and recently raised more than $82,000 (£53,512) on Kickstarter to put it into production. The Salt card is made of durable plastic with a matte finish and is the same height and length as an ordinary credit card. However, it's three times as thick because it has to be big enough to store the battery, which lasts for 18 months. The credit card-sized gadget (illustrated) also locks devices again as soon as a user moves out of range. It connects to an app on a user’s Android handset or iPhone via Bluetooth and also tells them if they have strayed too far from their wallet, where it is suggested the Salt card is stored . The start-up claims that its Salt card is more secure than fingerprint scanners, such as the one in Apple's iPhone 6 handset (pictured) and it can be used with gloves in the winter . Chip maker Qualcomm has unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner - the first biometric sensor using ultrasonic technology. It uses ultrasonic sound waves to capture the ridges, sweat pores and more on the tip of a finger in greater detail than capacitive touch ID sensors seen on the likes of Apple and Samsung devices. This not only makes it more accurate than other sensors, but it will also work even if the user’s hands are wet or have dirt or lotions on it, for example. Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with. Setting up the card is said to be simple, as users only have to enter the unique 12-digit code printed on the front of the card in the iOS or Android app to register it as their own. From then on, their phone automatically unlocks when they move within 10ft (three metres) of it. It does this thanks to a Bluetooth chip that emits a low-frequency signal that can be read by the phone, but doesn't consume the battery, according to the start-up. ‘You don't have to connect it your phone like you normally do with Bluetooth - it basically acts as a beacon and finds your phone, unlocking it,’ Mr Paglione said. The card sends notifications to a user’s phone if they leave their wallet containing the card behind, as well as telling them the last location they had it. In the future it will be possible to change the proximity needed for the card to unlock the phone. ‘So you could set it for 30 feet (9 metres) when you're in your house so you don't have to put in your pin at home, but when you're out you might want it so it only unlocks when the card is in your hand, so you could set it to one foot proximity,’ he explained. It is claimed that the card  will save people around 53 hours over a year, based on the time it takes to type a password into their phone 150 times a day . The card costs $20 (£13) and can be ordered from the company’s website. Mr Paglione, 30, said that as well as being tedious, constantly entering a password can be a security issue because criminals can spot a pattern and there are cameras everywhere. ‘Many people are looking for additional ways to secure their phone and people are always looking for ways to save time,’ he said. However, it may appear that if a user's handbag is stolen with their wallet including the card and their phone inside, Salt may prove less secure than a stanard password. MailOnline has asked the firm is this is the case. Mr Zistakis, an architect by profession, developed a prototype using a Bluetooth headset and then Mr Paglione added his manufacturing expertise to create the product. He conceded: ‘There are other people doing similar things, but the difference is we have put it into a device that can be hidden away and at $20 it's very affordable. ‘The card is waterproof, so you could go swimming with it.’ There are already key fobs that can unlock handsets and many people no longer input a PIN, instead using biometric technology, such as fingerprint scanners and  face scanners, to unlock their smartphones. The iPhone 6, for example, has Touch ID, which enables users to unlock their handset by placing their finger on a button for a couple of seconds, while Fujitsu recently unveiled an iris scanner at Mobile World Congress that uses infrared light to unlock a handset. But the pair of Salt card inventors say that phone unlocking is just the beginning for them and in the future, they hope to develop the idea as a platform for communicating with all sorts of electronic devices. 'One day we'd like the card to communicate with doors, unlocking as you approach them, lights turning on and off or you walk into a restaurant and you won't need to let them know you've arrived, it'll just book you in, Mr Paglione said. There are already key fobs that can unlock handsets and many people no longer input a PIN, instead using biometric technology such as fingerprint scanners and iris scanners (illustrated) to unlock their smartphones . Fujitsu has developed a ‘custom compact and high-output infrared LED’, and a custom infrared camera. These were combined with Fujitsu’s camera controller technology and biometric-authentication technology. It identifies a person by scanning the pattern of their iris. The pattern doesn’t change significantly after the age of two, and it is difficult to injure its surface and difficult to forge. Movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye’s openings larger or smaller, which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina. For its prototype, Fujitsu has built a miniature scanner so it fits on the front of a smartphone. It recognises the pattern by shining an infrared LED light on the sensor into the eyes and taking a picture of the pattern with the infrared camera. This pattern is registered and linked to the user. Each time they look at their phone, the sensor scans their eye, matches it with the stored image and unlocks the device. ‘The system can reliably authenticate the detailed patterns of the iris and that can be used in most everyday situations,’ a spokesman for Fujitsu told MaiOnline . ‘This can be used at a normal smartphone viewing distance, rather than within the 10cm range most existing iris recognition systems require. ‘And in safety testing, the infrared LED light was verified to be safe for the eyes.’","Salt card is designed to replace passwords and fingerprint scanners .

"It's the fat-shaming/fit-shaming controversy that's refusing to go away . Online fitness company Protein World caused a Twitter storm recently with its London Underground poster of a genetically-blessed model in a small yellow bikini, asking: 'Are you beach body ready?' The poster, promoting weight loss, came under fire from some feminists and body image campaigners who branded the campaign body-shaming and called for the offending images to be removed. Transport for London are in the process of removing the ad, and now internet pranksters have hit back with their own version of the poster, this time featuring three curvaceous women and featuring the caption: 'Yes. We are beach body ready.' Scroll down for video . 'Yes. We are beach body ready': An unknown internet source has recreated the controversial Protein World ad, with curvy alternatives . The original poster, from Protein World, has been subject to much controversy, with many citing it as 'body-shaming' The spoof advert follows the same striking format as the Protein World original, with an eye-catching yellow background and bold font, and is marked up as a Dove product (Dove's real beauty campaign encourages women to appreciate their bodies, regardless of size and shape) but the brand have denied being involved. After being made aware of the copycat image a representative for Dove said: The ad was not created by Dove but we do believe that every woman is beach body ready! Dove added: 'In 2004, 75% of women felt advertising and media set unrealistic standards of beauty. Today, that figure is 66%, with the perception being that more diversity is portrayed in the images of women we see around us. 'We have clearly made some progress in the 11 years since Dove started Campaign for Real Beauty but there is still much to do. Two thirds of UK women would prefer to see more women of different weights and shapes, different ages and without digital enhancement in the media. This is why Dove will continue to champion beauty for everyone because looking and feeling your best makes you feel happier.' The image, which was posted on the London underground, is now being removed following complaints . Billboards such as this one, were defaced, as a result of anger from body image campaigners and bloggers . It comes as plus-sized fashion label Simply Be also created its own poster. The parody showing model Jocelyn Corona in a bikini is being displayed at London's Knightsbridge Tube station on Saturday. Protesters are planning to gather  to demonstrate against the original poster. Ms Corona said: 'Every woman has the right to feel comfortable in their own skin. I love being able to show off my curves, so it's great to see brands like Simply Be representing real women in the UK.' Simply Be spokesman Ed Watson said that the controversial Protein World advert was 'at best outdated, at worst insulting'. He said: 'While the Protein World model, Renee, is undeniably beautiful and I'm sure very healthy, it is irresponsible to project something that is largely unachievable as the ideal. 'We need to make people feel great about themselves and this poster does the opposite. 'Because it so literally flew in the face of our ethos of self-acceptance, we wanted to get our message out further, hence taking ad space in one of London's busiest tube stations.' The original yellow billboard image received around 270 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), mostly insisting that it objectified women and that it carried the insinuation that only svelte models were ready to go to the beach. The model in the advert, Renee Somerfield, 24, has spoken out about being body-shamed herself . Various posters were subject to defiant vandalism, with uproar sweeping social media. One billboard was pasted over with a piece of paper which read: 'Your body is fine just as it is. Whatever it looks like, your body is not a commodity. #Everybody'sReady #EverydaySexism' Although fitness company Protein World claims that the image is unPhotoshopped, it clearly touched a nerve, with a further 60,000 outraged people signing an online petition on website Change.org asking Protein World to take down the ads. Interestingly, the 24-year-old model in the ad herself, Australian Renee Somerfield has cited the irony of people getting angry about the 'body-shaming' poster, whilst body-shaming her. In an interview with Huffington Post, the model said: 'I am a real person behind the image. I work very hard and live a healthy and active lifestyle which is why Protein World chose me for their campaign. I couldn't work every day as a full time model by starving myself, dieting or not looking after my body. Nourish your body, be kind to it and it will love you right back, no matter your size.'","An unknown internet source has recreated the ad with curvy alternatives .

"A film-mad woman got her picture perfect proposal when her fiancé proposed to her on the big screen of a cinema. Fabio Lovato, 30, created a short video that played following the cinema trailers for Fast and Furious 7 showcasing pictures from where they met in Australia. The one minute and 30 second video ended with a picture of the couple and the words, 'Laura I have a questions for you'. Scroll down for video . Fabio Lavato proposed to his girlfriend Laura Knight in their local Cineworld in Gloucester . Fabio then got down on one knee in the Cineworld in Gloucester and popped the question to his shocked girlfriend Laura Knight, 29. Italian-born Fabio, who now lives in Quedgeley, Gloucester with Laura, says that he always knew he wanted to marry Laura. He said: 'It was love at first sight for me. I always knew she was the one and I wanted to make sure the proposal was extra special. 'Lots of people propose at restaurants so I just thought it would be great to do it at the cinema where a video could be played on the screen and she would be completely surprised. Fabio created a video showcasing pictures of their time together followed by the words 'Laura I have a question for you' that was played at the end of the trailers of Fast and Furious 7 . The film included pictures from their time together in Australia, 2013, where the couple met . 'It was absolutely amazing and I am so glad she said yes.' The pair met while Laura was backpacking around Asia, ending up in Australia, and Fabio was working in the country. Laura says she had no idea that Fabio was planning to propose - especially not in the cinema. She said: 'The trailers finished and these pictures of Australia started to play. 'I thought it must be an advert at first but the song was one we were introduced to over in Australia and it is not well known over here - they wouldn't have used it on an advert.' Pretty soon Laura, a deputy manager at a dental practice, clicked that there was something suspicious about the 'advert'. Fabio has lived with Laura, pictured together, in Quedgeley, Gloucester, since last year . The pair are both big film fans so the cinema acted as the perfect location for the proposal . 'The pictures kept playing and I began thinking to myself they looked familiar. 'The next thing I know it was a giant picture of myself and then a picture of us as a couple. 'That's when I thought ""oh my God"" - I was over whelmed. He got on one knee and everyone started clapping.' Fabio, a hospital record clerk, had been planning the event for two months, talking to Laura's parents, the cinema, friends and colleagues. The proposal took meticulous planning with Fabio waiting until he was alone to make the film so that Laura wouldn't notice. Despite the pair being massive film buffs Laura was too excited to stay and watch the rest of the film, but says it was the perfect proposal. Although Laura loved the proposal she says she doesn't rate Fast and Furious . 'I thought it was amazing. I have a love for films myself. We share that, both having a passion for films. 'For him to do it like that meant a lot. Although it wasn't personal in terms of people being there, it was personal to me, because of the way he did it.' Although Laura was completely overjoyed by the proposal she admits that Fabio's choice of film was questionable. 'The fact that the cinema let us do it was amazing. There is no connection to the film though really, it was just what was showing at the time. 'I wouldn't rate Fast And Furious in my top 10. It was a big film though and completely sold out. 'I'm glad it wasn't Cinderella because it would have just been children. Luckily, no popcorn came my way.' The couple are now in the process of planning their wedding, although no date has been set.","Fabio Lavato popped the question to Laura Knight at their local Cineworld .

"Holy smokes! Researchers found the bombardier beetle (pictured) mimics a machine gun by mixing chemicals in an internal 'reaction chamber' A beetle with a machine gun built into its rear end sounds like something from a comic or sci-fi film - or the stuff of nightmares. But researchers have discovered the Bombardier beetle mimics this powerful weapon by mixing chemicals in an internal 'reaction chamber' in its stomach. When threatened, the diminutive bug can then repeatedly fire streams of foul-smelling liquid from its rear, complete with 'gun smoke'. It can even precisely aim the nozzle at the attacker. This behaviour has been caught on camera by Wendy Moore and her colleagues at the University of Arizona. Many beetles secrete foul-smelling or bad-tasting chemicals from their abdomens to ward off predators, but bombardier beetles take it a step further. When threatened, they combine chemicals in an explosive chamber in their abdomen to simultaneously heat and propel their defensive load as a boiling hot spray. Assistant Professor Moore, from the Department of Entomology at the university, has published a paper along with her team that not only reveals the beetle's firing apparatus in never-before-seen detail, but also solves a long-standing mystery of how the animals achieve their incredible rapid-fire capabilities. 'Understanding how these beetles produce - and survive - repetitive explosions could provide new design principles for technologies such as blast mitigation and propulsion,' she said. The study was led by doctoral student Eric Arndt and Christine Ortiz in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. Arndt and Ortiz teamed up with Professor Moore to study the anatomy of the beetle's reaction chamber, which is constructed of cuticle, a composite of chitin, proteins and waxes. The material, which also makes up the exoskeleton of insects, protects the beetle from the toxic chemicals, high temperatures and high pressures during explosions. A real hot shot! The research, including video footage (shown above) not only reveals the beetle's firing apparatus in never-before-seen detail, but also solves a long-standing mystery of how the bugs achieve their rapid-fire capabilities . The mechanism of the bombardier beetle's spray pulsation had not been understood because previous studies, relying on external observations, could not probe exactly what happens inside the reaction chamber of the chemical gun. African bombardier beetles can accurately hit targets in any direction. Researchers at Cornell University snapped another type of Bombardier beetle, Stenaptinus insignis' attack in 1999, to reveal they use the explosive defensive mechanism to buy time when they are under attack. The beetle is quite vulnerable on the ground because unlike most insects such as bees and flies, it can't take off instantly. This means that the slow process of unfurling its wings could cost the insect its life if under attack from ants, for example. So it attacks its attackers in turn, giving it time to get airborne. The spray itself contains p-benzoquinones - compounds known for their irritant properties. The chemicals are stored separately in the creature's abdomen and then combine explosively, explaining why they are ejected at such high speed and at 100 C. 'Twenty-five years ago, a team of scientists from Cornell University and MIT discovered that each blast from the bombardier beetle is actually a series of extraordinarily fast micro-pulses,' Assistant Professor Moore said. 'What wasn't known is what causes each discharge to be pulsed, like a machine gun. 'Previous researchers suggested that the pulses were caused by muscle contractions or by a fluttering of the exit duct during the explosions.' Using enzymes that digest muscle and fat, the researchers cleaned the reaction chamber, which enabled them to examine it under a microscope. While studying the shape of the reaction chamber, they noticed that some regions of the chamber wall were thin and not as strong as others, and that one region near the mixing valve looked particularly thin. They predicted that this thin cuticle would be displaced by the force of the reactions in such a way that it would impinge upon the valve - temporarily shutting off the flow of reactants. To investigate this hypothesis, the team directly observed the internal dynamics of spray pulsation in live Brachinus elongatulus beetles, a type of bombardier beetle, which is found throughout southern Arizona. Of 500 beetles, the researchers were able to record 30 discharges from 14 individuals. This was enough to provide high-definition, high-speed video of what happens inside a bombardier beetle's reaction chamber when it goes off. All guns blazing: 'Twenty-five years ago, a team of scientists from Cornell University and MIT discovered that each blast from the bombardier beetle is actually a series of extraordinarily fast micro-pulses,' Assistant Professor Moore said, which led to the machine gun analogy. A stock image of a machine gun is shown . It turns out the pulses are generated in a passive way, not through an active process involving muscle contraction, as previously thought. As the chemicals pass through a valve into the reaction chamber, they mix with enzymes and explosively liberate oxygen gas, water vapor and heat, propelling a hot, noxious spray down the nozzle and out the exit pore. Each explosion inside the chamber forces a highly elastic region of the chamber wall - the thin cuticular area Moore found in her earlier dissections - to expand and impinge on the valve that separates the two chambers, temporarily cutting off the flow of reactants and resulting in a pulsed delivery. 'It turns out the expansion membrane of the reaction chamber acts as a passive closure mechanism, which is something that had not been described or even predicted before this study,' Professor Moore said. 'We also discovered that the chamber's anatomy varies between female and male beetles.' While it is still not completely clear why it might be beneficial to the beetle to have a pulsed delivery, she suspects that dividing the spray into very short, rapid pulses allows the beetle to sustain the energy of the blast and its small body size at the same time. 'By having a pulsed delivery, these small beetles produce a relatively large amount of defensive spray, which they can aim precisely and with great force and speed,' she said. 'This is truly one of the most remarkable and elegant defensive mechanisms documented to date.' When threatened, the bombardier beetle repeatedly fires streams of liquid from its rear, complete with 'gun smoke'. The expulsion of fluid is shown in the images above, which come from a 1999 study that found another bug, Stenaptinus insignis, uses its weapon to 'buy time' when under attack because it can't fly away .","Bombardier beetle mimics machine gun using chemicals in its stomach .

The Rubber Bowl hosted 310 UA football contests, 19 preseason Cleveland Browns' games, a regular-season NFL game in 1952 and over 1,500 high school games, according to FootballPark.com. It also hosted other events including wrestling, soccer matches and the circus. There were originally hopes the stadium could also hold events like Easter sunrise services, pageants, light operas, musicals, conventions, track meets, bicycle races, midget auto races, softball tournaments, exhibition tennis tournaments, rodeos, Mardi Gras festivals, winter carnivals and ice hockey. The stadium, which can now hold more than 35,000 people, was closed in 2009 when the Zips moved into InfoCision Stadium. It has has sat empty ever since, Cleveland.com reported. During the 1972 performance by the Rolling Stones at the Rubber Bowl, Mick Jagger 'hopped around like a Hopi Indian' one reviewer said . Bands like Van Halen, Metallica, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Bob Dylan, The Grateful Dead and Aretha Franklin also have played there . The pictures of how the Rubber Bowl looks now were taken by photographer Seph Lawless as part of his Autopsy of America project . Lawless, a Cleveland native, has been traveling and using his camera to document abandoned parts of America for the last several years . The Zips first played at the stadium in 1940, the year after it was built, and finished their season there in November of 2008 against Buffalo . The pictures of how the Rubber Bowl looks now were taken by photographer Seph Lawless, a Cleveland native. He has been traveling and documenting abandoned parts of America for the last several years as part of a project called Autopsy of America. Lawless told Daily Mail Online: 'I've been to a lot of abandoned areas of the country but nothing is more surreal than being inside the larger abandoned structures. 'It's like being in an episode of  The Walking Dead. 'It often feels like the world has ended and you're the only person left and somehow I'm ok with that feeling. 'It's almost peaceful. Lawless didn't make it to see the Rolling Stones at the Rubber Bowl in 1972, but he was there 16 years later for the Monsters of Rock Tour featuring Van Halen, Metallica and the Scorpions in 1988. He said: 'I remember going here to see my very first rock and roll concert to watch Metallica perform, which was amazing. 'Hearing live music outdoors in a venue like this was part of the rock and roll experience... the scent of cigarettes and spilled beer. 'When Metallica performed their song Fade to Black, everyone held lighters up. 'It was so intense you could just feel the heat. 'That night people could see the Rubber Bowl from outer space. It was out of this world.' The UA Zips left the stadium in 2009 and moved into InfoCision Stadium. It has been sitting empty and falling into disrepair ever since .

The group's plan to refurbish the stadium into a home for a United States Football League team fell apart, but there is still hope for the Rubber Bowl. Bill Dunn, vice president of marketing for Team 1 said: 'We are going to put it back where it was, but with all the updated amenities. 'Those photos really show the worst parts of the stadium. 'Most of the damage is cosmetic.' Dunn added that the stadium's structure is still sound and it could be open and running within six to eight months.

"Paul Smith has landed one of the toughest fights in boxing after finalising terms to face Andre Ward on June 20. As revealed by Sportsmail, the fight in Oakland, California will not be for Ward's WBA super-middleweight world title. But it amounts to a huge, albeit daunting, opportunity for Smith, who failed in back-to-back challenges for Arthur Abraham's WBO belt. Paul Smith (left) has landed a shot at the unbeaten Californian Andre Ward . Ward (right) has not fought since he beat Edwin Rodriguez on points in November 2013 . In Ward he will face a man who outclassed Carl Froch in 2011, but who has been inactive since November 2013. Ring rust from that 17-month spell could be a factor in determining if Smith can beat one of the sport's top pound-for-pound talents, with the 32-year-old saying: 'I cannot wait to get back in the ring and test myself against a class act like Andre Ward. 'I proved that I belong at the top level with my performances against Arthur Abraham and this is a challenge that I am relishing. Andre is a top pound-for-pound fighter and someone I respect a lot, but he has only boxed once in almost three years and I will give it everything I have got. 'I am fresh and confident going into this fight. It's a massive opportunity for me and one that I took with both hands when it was offered. I have spent a lot of time boxing in the United States and I look forward to returning for this fight.' Ward said: 'I'm very excited to be coming back on June 20 at Oracle Arena in my hometown of Oakland, which has been a long time coming. I have an extremely tough fighter in front of me in Paul Smith, who's looking to pull the upset, but I can't let that happen. 'I have to be on my best game to turn Smith away and beat him the way I want to beat him.'

"A marathon runner who parked his car before taking part in the race has found it again  nine days after the 26 mile event following a public appeal. Jason Matthews, 40, left his black Saab 93 in a side street on his way to the starting line of the Manchester Marathon on April 19. But when the runner from Wolverhampton finished the race after five hours 11 minutes of running he was unable to remember where he had parked it. Jason Matthews, 40, (pictured after the race) lost his car after parking up before the Manchester Marathon on April 19 and is about to be reunited with it after a Good Samaritan gave up his day off to join the search . Mr Matthews spent hours searching for his missing car, even retracing some of the marathon route before enlisting the help of a taxi driver to help him. He spent 40 minutes driving through the area of the city surrounding Manchester United's Old Trafford ground before going to a police station to ask for help, but eventually had to give up and get a train back to his home in the Midlands. However, his car has now been found safe and sound by Adam Coppin from Salford, who read of Mr Matthews's plight and decided to use his day off to help. Mr Coppin, 32, spent this morning searching for Mr Matthews's car and found it safe and sound in an office car park in Salford Quays. 'I've been in similar situations parking at work, then forgetting what floor of the multi-storey I've parked on and walking around for ages,' said Mr Coppin, who works as a technical advisor at MediaCityUK. 'I could imagine his frustration, especially after running a marathon. 'I read the story on Monday night and had an idea from the description where it might be. 'As I had today off, I decided to go out and look for it and managed to find it. 'There is no damage apart from a few blossoms falling down on it from the tree above. I'm glad I could help.' Mr Matthews left his black Saab 93, similar to this model, in a side street close to Manchester United's Old Trafford ground before the race . Mr Matthews, a delivery driver for a builders' merchants, said he could remember driving into Manchester up Princess Parkway and then onto the Mancunian Way, before taking the A56 towards Trafford on his way to the race. He then remembers driving past Old Trafford on his left before parking up in a car park on a side street near a small office block. Mr Matthews, who was competing in the Manchester Marathon for the first time, said: 'The area looked like a small estate and there were chaps with high vis vests waving people in. 'I did the race then walked back past Old Trafford and looked around for about an hour. 'I actually ended up walking part of the course again. 'Then I spent about 40 minutes in a taxi and we looked all around near the Imperial War Museum but couldn't find it. Mr Matthews had searched this area of Manchester during the hunt for his missing car . 'I went to the police station and there was another chap and a lady there in exactly the same position.' Mr Matthews, who has competed in nine other marathons, added: 'I was that worn out, I was just anxious and annoyed. Manchester council had told him there was no record of the vehicle, which had a silver bike rack attached to it, being towed or impounded. Grateful Mr Matthews said he was so relieved to be reunited with the vehicle that he wants to make a donation to a charity of Mr Coppin's choice in order to say thank you. He plans to travel to Manchester tomorrow to retrieve his vehicle. 'I am so relieved, it's a massive burden lifted off me,' he said. 'I'm so glad I don't have to go out looking for it again or buy a new car. I am so grateful to this chap for finding it for me. 'Once I've got it back I'd like to make a donation to a charity of his choice to say thank you for his troubles.'","Jason Matthews, 40, parked in side street before Manchester Marathon .

"The performance of Jimmy Anderson on the last morning of the second Test was one of the greatest I have seen from an England cricketer. He did everything right as a bowler, catcher and fielder. It was Botham-esque. England must be doing something right behind the scenes if one of their players can produce something like that almost out of nothing. Sessions that win matches do not happen purely by chance. When something like that happens it’s very hard to adhere to the old mantra of not getting too up when things go well and not too low when they go badly. England captain Alastair Cook celebrates as he scores the runs to defeat West Indies in the second Test . Cook (left) dives to his left to take a catch at first slip and claim the wicket of Chanderpaul . England must remember that, having won a crucial toss, they had the best conditions against the eighth-ranked side in the world. But this was a win to savour. Anderson may have won it with his extraordinary display but the key to me in England going one-up was the captaincy and batting of Alastair Cook. There were times during the Ashes when it was very clear who was leading Australia on the field but not so obvious who was in charge of England. Arms were being waved everywhere and, if you did not know Cook was the England captain, you would never have guessed it from watching them. Yet now he looks completely in charge of this England team. Whether it is because he has a young team or whether he has simply said, ‘Sod it, I’ve taken a lot of criticism and now I’m going to do it my way,’ I don’t know. But even on the fourth evening when West Indies were only two down and the match looked destined to be a draw Cook was still impressive in the field. He seems to be on top of the big two senior bowlers in Anderson and Stuart Broad, as was made clear in the first Test when he had a little argument over fielding positions with Anderson and very much got his own way. James Anderson (left) celebrates the dismissal of West Indies batsman Marlon Samuels . Cook (left) celebrates with team-mate Gary Ballance (right) during the second test last week . And it makes such a massive difference to the captain if he is scoring runs. Everything becomes clearer and you do not have to fret over your place. OK, Cook hasn’t scored that elusive century yet and the big test will come when he faces the moving ball again but for now his game looks in very good order again and he is making very good half-centuries. You have to say that it suits the way England play to be up against West Indies. England like to sit in, be patient and build pressure on a side. West Indies are perfect for that because they are not coming at England in this series. Cook appears to have learnt from his mistakes. Last summer, for instance, his decision to spread the field when Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews was batting with the tail lost England the Headingley Test but here he kept the field up to Denesh Ramdin in a similar situation and kept the pressure on. Cook (right) kicks the wicket in frustration after being dismissed for 13 runs against  the West Indies . The test, of course, will come when Brad Haddin is flailing it to all parts at some point this summer and the wheels are coming off Anderson and Broad. That is when Cook will need to show the same presence and leadership. For now there is a lot for Cook and England to be pleased about, not least the batting of Joe Root and Gary Ballance who are breaking all sorts of records at such a young age. Ballance may not always be easy on the eye but who cares? He gets the job done. There is, of course, still work to be done and there is clearly a concern over Jonathan Trott going into Friday’s third Test. Trott was frenetic again at the start of his second innings, having looked much more like his old self as he spent time at the crease first time round. As I said before the second Test, he needs to be given the whole of this series before England make a decision on him. If he can bring his old calmness to the start of his innings as an opener, England will have a very good player back in the side. But if he continues to be too frenetic in Barbados then England might have to think again at the start of a huge summer when life will get much tougher.","Jimmy Anderson's recent performance in the second Test was one of the greatest I've ever seen from an England cricketer .
However, Alastair Cook's played an even bigger role in England's success .

"Jack Grealish feels ashamed about inhaling nitrous oxide through a balloon and has assured Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood he will not repeat his mistake. Sherwood told his young winger, who inspired Villa to FA Cup semi-final victory over Liverpool on Sunday, that such behaviour could not be tolerated by the club. Grealish, 19, was pictured taking so-called ‘hippy crack’, a legal high, after a night out nearly a year ago, with the image published in The Sun on Thursday. Jack Grealish has become the third top flight starlet caught on camera inhaling nitrous oxide . Grealish starred for Aston Villa in their FA Cup semi-final win over Liverpool on Sunday at Wembley . Raheem Sterling, 20, and Saido Berahino, 21, have been pictured doing the same recently and the PFA will look to increase their education to players on the risks of nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas. Users say it creates feelings of euphoria and light-headedness but drug advice website Frank warns ‘there is a risk of death as a lack of oxygen can occur’. Sherwood said on Thursday: ‘I’m not pleased. I spoke to Jack first thing this morning as he came in, I explained to him his behaviour can’t be tolerated by the football club. ‘He did not come in here with the “I’m only young, I’m allowed to get away with it” attitude. He was very ashamed and does not like the bad publicity. He’s assured me it won’t happen again.’ Grealish has not been fined over the incident and will be in Villa’s squad for the trip to Manchester City. He was given his first Premier League start on April 7 and has been integral to his side’s success in the past three games. The PFA have noticed a growing trend in the recreational use of nitrous oxide, and will look to adapt their extensive tutoring programmes on substance abuse. John Bramhall, PFA deputy chief executive, said: ‘We’re working with Sporting Chance, delivering the message, and it’s a continuing process. It will change as different issues come into focus.’ The selfie, which shows Grealish and a friend, was taken in a hotel room after a night out, according to The Sun. Sherwood hopes Grealish can learn a lesson, not only about his choices but how such information can come into public knowledge. ‘He’s hurting but he needs to stop hurting,’ said Sherwood. ‘Perhaps a year ago when the photo was taken no-one wanted to know Jack Grealish but now he realises people have taken an awful lot of notice — and he wanted that. If you’re a professional footballer you want to be noticed. Emre Can of Liverpool tries to tackle Grealish during their FA Cup tie with Aston Villa at Wembley . ‘But he needs to get on the other side of the paper. I want him to forget about this by Saturday. I don’t want him to dwell on it. It only really affects me if I let it affect him on the pitch. ‘As I said about Raheem last week, he’s a young man. Jack was even younger a year earlier when the picture was taken. But it doesn’t matter how young he is, he is now in a responsible position as a professional footballer, he’s got to make sure it won’t happen again; he’s assured me it won’t. ‘I’m not worried. To be honest there is only one form of discipline, that’s self-discipline, that’s what really matters. Jack has to take that on board now. This is an eye-opener for him, he has to realise he has to be very careful who he can trust out there. ‘I think he’s a fantastic talent, he’s willing to work hard at it, he will be a big player for the future of Aston Villa football club.’ Grealish, who presented an award at his cousin’s Under 12s team on Tuesday, has thrived on the pitch under the responsibility handed to him by Sherwood. ‘The circumstances probably dictated that I thought, “Why not? Let’s throw the dice. Let’s get him in there”. He’s not let anyone down.’","Jack Grealish was pictured inhaling nitrous oxide through a balloon .

"Counter-terrorism police have searched a community centre and a man's home as part of the investigation into the killing of a Syrian imam found shot dead on a London street. Officers searched the An Noor community centre in west London last night after a businessman appeared in court charged with murdering Abdul Hadi Arwani, and another man was arrested over his death. They also visited the Wembley home of Burnell Mitchell, 61, who is a director at the community centre where Mr Arwani used to preach. Death: Leslie Cooper, left, has appeared in court charged with murdering iman Abdul Hadi Arwani, right . Search: Police visited the Wembley home of Burnell Mitchell, a director of the community centre where Mr Arwani used to preach regularly . Home: Mr Mitchell has scaffolding outside his two-bedroom property in Wembley . Last night the Metropolitan Police revealed that they had arrested a 61-year-old man on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, after Leslie Cooper, 36 appeared at Camberwell Magistrates' Court yesterday. Officers visited An Noor, in Acton, to search for further clues in the killing of Mr Arwani, 48, who was an outspoken opponent of the Assad regime in his native country. The other address searched by police yesterday was Mr Mitchell's home in Wembley, which was cordoned off as police investigated the property. The 61-year-old, who is said to be a Muslim convert from Jamaica, is a trustee of An Noor and a director of the company which owns the site of the building. Neighbours said that Mr Mitchell, who is known as 'Bernie' or 'Khaled', was of Jamaican origin and became a Muslim several years ago. Raid: Police pictured outside the An Noor community centre in west London while searching the premises . Probe: Officers in plain clothes looked at a car parked near the community centre today . His home has apparently been covered in scaffolding for 10 years as builders have worked on an extension to the property. The raid on An Noor was believed to be the first major counter-terror operation in a mosque since 2003, and police insisted that they had taken steps to avoid inflaming community tensions with the search. A spokesman said: 'As part of the ongoing investigation, officers are carrying out a number of searches of addresses in London including areas within the An Noor Cultural and Community Centre in West London. 'All officers involved in the search of the mosque are sensitive to the impact that their presence will have and are aware that this action may cause concern in the local community. 'We have been in contact with trusted community Muslim advisors this afternoon to reassure them that the action is necessary and that the premises will re-open as quickly as possible.‪' Mr Arwani was found dead in his black Volkswagen Passat on a street in Wembley last Tuesday. Ongoing: Police are still appealing for information as they continue to search various premises . Investigation: Police outside the community centre today as they continued their search . A post-mortem examination found that the father of six died from gunshot wounds, and counter-terrorism officers were tasked with investigating his killing. He was previously one of the leading preachers at An Noor, but was apparently forced out of the mosque a few years ago after a dispute with other imams. After Cooper, a Jamaican businessman, appeared in court yesterday it emerged that he had been arrested while his wife and children were at a barbecue hosted by a neighbour in Brent, north-west London. Friends described the murder suspect as a polite and teetotal church-goer, who works as a builder and a carpenter as well as running a business selling Jamaican-themed clothing. Describing the moment Cooper was arrested, a neighbour told the Daily Telegraph said: 'It was Sunday afternoon and his wife and kids were with me when suddenly there were police everywhere. 'Then they stormed inside. There were so many armed police with machine guns, it was like the Falklands War all over again.' Car: Mr Arwani was found dead last week in this Volkswagen Passat on a street in Wembley . Cooper was remanded in custody by a judge yesterday ahead of his appearance at the Old Bailey this week. Last night, Mr Arwani's family thanked the local community 'for the outpouring of support during this extremely difficult time'. In a statement released through Scotland Yard, his son Murhaf said: 'We are touched to learn how many people my father helped, advised and inspired in his short life. 'If anyone has any additional information that can help with the investigation, we urge you to please come forward and speak to the Metropolitan Police.

"It was a simple slip of the tongue, instantly corrected minutes after his last ever ride at Sandown on Saturday. After a tearful yet joyous and ultimately unsuccessful afternoon that none of the 18,000 spectators will forget, it was also the point at which AP McCoy acknowledged that he was an ex-jockey. ‘I am going to miss what I do . . . what I did,’ he said with a pained smile. That whole new routine kicked in yesterday. AP McCoy makes a lap of honour round the Parade ring with Champion Jockey's Trophy at Sandown . McCoy walks into Parade Ring to ride his final race on Box Office as the media assemble to get one last shot . A lie-in and cooked breakfast before a party for family and friends at his home near Lambourn. This week there will be two days as a spectator for McCoy at the Punchestown Festival. Then, when former colleagues head to Uttoxeter and Hexham on Saturday to make an early impression on the first AP-free jockeys’ title race in two decades, McCoy will be attending the wedding of one of wife Chanelle’s friends. The family duties and the exorbitant cost of a ticket means McCoy will not be heading to Las Vegas to watch Mayweather and Pacquiao. But there is a bucket list of things he wants to do now his life is no longer welded to the pursuit of riding perfection. Seeing his beloved Arsenal in the FA Cup final as well as, next season, travelling to watch them in Europe. McCoy with trainer Jonjo O'Neil after riding his final race on Box Office at Sandown racecourse on Saturday . Channel 4 presenter and tennis fan Emma Spencer . Riding some stages in the amateur Tour de France and attending the US Masters in Augusta. He can aim to reduce his own golf handicap and there is also another sporting challenge to conquer. McCoy, who doesn’t play tennis, has challenged Channel 4 presenter Emma Spencer, herself a tidy player, to a match with a tasty side bet riding on the outcome. Coaches are being lined up for McCoy’s crash course. Watch out Emma. Come to think of it, watch out Andy Murray. The list of diversions mean in the short term coping with life in Civvy Street should not be impossibly harrowing for the man who described Saturday as the ‘hardest day of my life’. During his Punchestown trip McCoy will also visit Robbie and JT McNamara, both battling degrees of paralysis after bad falls. It will inject a dose of sobering reality into his situation. McCoy said: ‘The fear of retirement is going to get worse in a month or a year. I think I will be all right in the first few weeks because I have things to do and I will be busy. ‘I will see Robbie McNamara on Tuesday and John Thomas on Wednesday. It will be nice to see the two lads and will put a lot of things into perspective.’ Sean Bowen won the conditional jockey title at Sandown on Saturday as is tipped for a bright future . There are media work offers to consider and a likely role with boss JP McManus. But McCoy will need something to satisfy his enormous work ethic. Last week he did not accept rides because he wanted to begin weaning himself off racing. But on Thursday night, trainer Paul Webber texted McCoy, saying he was short of a work rider for Friday morning, start time 7.45am. The 20-time champion jockey was not late. He also feels, painfully, that even his amazing records will be broken, perhaps even by the emerging Sean Bowen. The 17-year-old winner of Saturday feature bet365 Gold Cup on Just A Par has lifted the champion conditional jockey crown earlier in his life than McCoy managed. He has the same agent in Dave Roberts, who said: ‘What he is doing is freaky. We want to keep his feet on the ground but he has some talent.’ Sound familiar? A new era may be dawning.","AP McCoy will struggle with his new routine now he has retired from racing .

"Peter Scudamore rode an incredible 1,678 winners but has seen his achievements dwarfed by AP McCoy. Here, he identifies what he believes are the 10 finest achievements of Saturday's retiring champion. 1 RIDING HIS 4,000th WINNER AT TOWCESTER ON NOVEMBER 7, 2013 . He has won virtually every big race in the calendar but McCoy’s greatest feat has to be the immense tally of winners he has ridden. To put his numbers into perspective, in the all-time list of successful jockeys, great rival Richard Johnson is closest to him and the gap is around 1,500 winners. Tony McCoy celebrating after he won his 4,000th race on board Mountain Tune at Wetherby in 2013 . 2 HIS 20 STRAIGHT JUMP JOCKEY TITLES . If you like your champions dominant, you have to love McCoy. No modern sportsman can match his reign. He outstrips 16-time darts world champion Phil Taylor by almost 200 weeks, with a staggering 1,040 weeks at the top. That compares to 364 for Formula One’s Michael Schumacher and 302 for tennis ace Roger Federer. 3 WINNING THE 1994-95 CONDITIONAL JOCKEYS CHAMPIONSHIP . McCoy hit the ground running on his arrival in Britain from Ireland, landing the apprentice title for jumps jockeys with a record 74 wins. Not surprisingly, it is another McCoy record which still stands. 4 RECORD 290 WINNERS IN A SEASON (2001-02) The 300-winner season McCoy craved proved too much even for him but he got close with 289 in Britain and one abroad. His feat outstripped the European record of German Peter Schiergen (271 in 1995) and Sir Gordon Richards’ best of 269 in 1947. 5 WINNING BBC SPORTS PERSONALITY OF THE YEAR IN 2010 . Not to be underestimated. Frankie Dettori and Lester Piggott are household names but neither of those great jockeys won this prestigious title. McCoy’s prodigious achievements have transcended racing’s usual boundaries and his peerless career has gained the respect it deserves. McCoy stands proud with his Sport Personality of the Year Award in Birmingham in 2010 . 6 DON’T PUSH IT’S 2010 GRAND NATIONAL WIN . Picking out even a handful of McCoy’s best wins is an exercise in subjective futility. We all have our favourites but Don’t Push It’s victory at Aintree was arguably the most significant on the greatest stage. Plenty of top jockeys have never had a sniff of the Grand National winner’s enclosure. McCoy celebrates aboard Grand National winner Don't Push It at Aintree racecourse in 2013 . 7 WORTH HIS WEIGHT . Unbelievably, given the lengths to which he has gone to control his weight and boil himself down, McCoy has never had to put up overweight (carry more than his mount was allotted). It is another example of his extraordinary self control. 8 BREAKING MY FASTEST TIME TO 100 WINNERS IN A SEASON . I never thought my fastest-to-100-wins record would stand forever but in November 1996 McCoy thrashed my best by 30 days. A season later and he beat his own record by 16 days. This season he set a new best for a fastest ton on August 21, 116 days into the season. McCoy achieved the fastest ever century of jumping winners at Warwick in 1996 on board Class of 92 . 9 NOT JUST THE WIDTH, FEEL THE QUALITY . He has not had the consistent big-race firepower of compatriot Ruby Walsh but 31 winners at the Cheltenham Festival is still an amazing tally for McCoy and includes three Champion Hurdles and two Gold Cups. To put that in perspective, John Francome only had 10 Festival wins and Richard Dunwoody 18, while I had 13. In all, he rode 196 wins at Cheltenham. 10 THE WORCESTER SOURCE . McCoy has ridden more winners at Worcester — 298 from 1,089 rides — than at any course in Britain and the venue, while not individually significant, is symbolic. It shows what a force of energy he has been at the mundane weekly meetings. Never has his motivation dropped, no matter how small the stage. It is a trait which set him apart.

"These extraordinary images show how an enormous jumbo jet has been converted into a luxury home for a mystery billionaire - complete with bedrooms, multiple lounges and an onboard restaurant. The custom-built Boeing 747 is believed to have cost its ultra-wealthy owner £400million after it was customised to fit his specifications exactly over a three-year period. The jumbo jet would normally carry as many as 600 passengers - but this version was built for just a single tycoon, although he will be able to fit dozens of guests. It contains a large dining room where travellers can enjoy meals cooked in an adjoining kitchen, with a lounge and 'state room' at the back of the plane. More sleeping space is provided in the 'aeroloft' on the top deck of the vessel, with eight full beds for passengers who prefer to get some shut-eye on flights. Luxury: This is the lounge on board a custom-built Boeing 747-8, as depicted in an artist's impression by Greenpoint Technologies .

Kicking back: The main suite could easily be mistaken for a room in a top hotel thanks to its over-the-top decorations . Restaurant: The central portion of the plane hosts a dining room which is attached to a kitchen, allowing the owner to make use of the services of a private chef . Shiny: The jumbo jet is one of the most luxurious private planes ever built, with the price tag believed to have reached a total of £400million .

Plush: Another artist's impression of the main state room, which also contains a desk so the owner can switch between work and relaxation . Welcoming: Images of the lounge show a space very different to the normal aeroplane cabin, with the traditional rows of seats completely discarded in favour of a hotel-like ambience .

"Portland Timbers defender Liam Ridgewell writes his second column for Sportsmail with the 2015 Major League Soccer season well under way in the United States. Here, the 30-year-old from Bexleyheath discusses his family's visits to Portland, coming up against Orlando City's Brazilian star Kaka and the upcoming clash against fierce rivals Seattle Sounders on Monday morning at 2:30am UK time. Fifty hours. That was how long a group of our fans camped outside Providence Park before the game against FC Dallas. They already had tickets, but just wanted to be first into the stadium. Sounds crazy right? I was walking around the city with Nat Borchers and we stopped to have a chat. It’s wicked to see supporters' passion, and they carry that throughout the matches. The atmosphere is special. On game day I love the national anthem at the start. It’s not mine but it really gees me up. The fans swing their scarves and sing. It’s an honour to play in front of them. Liam Ridgewell in action for the Portland Timbers with the new MLS season well under way in the States . Ridgewell (right) attempts to gee up his side during a match against New York City FC last week . We beat Dallas 3-1 for our first victory of the season, which was especially pleasing as my children Luca and Eva were over visiting with my parents Bob and Linda. Nice to get up and running. It’s been raining quite a bit but one day we got the paddle boards out, and the kids had a splash on the lake behind my house. Luca, who’s nine, came into training with me every day. He pottered about, spoke to the lads, and kicked the ball around. I don’t know about having his old man’s talent – can we call it that? – but he loves it. There is a lot of pressure on younger kids now, I don’t want to be too pushy, let him enjoy it. He went training with the Timbers Under-9s one day and met Gavin Wilkinson, the general manager, and the owner Merritt Paulson. He was asking loads of questions about how much he’d spent and how much various things cost, as kids do. There were no boundaries. Merritt was lovely and had a bit of banter. Perhaps Luca will pursue a career as an agent! Either that or a personal trainer. He spotted a dodge ball court at the local play centre so we had a game. After 20 minutes my thighs were burning. It is nothing like the film, there are trampolines and it’s tiring bouncing from one to the next. Luca wanted to keep going. I tried to teach him the dodge, dip, dive, and duck routine but he wasn’t having any of it. My kids have now left and watching them go at the airport is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. It seems to get worse every time. They are coming back in July and I’m excited already. Ridgewell (back, second right) lines up for a Portland Timbers team photo ahead of an MLS match .

Portland Timbers mascot Timber Joey uses a chainsaw to cut a timber slab after a goal is scored . Nat is my central defensive partner and beard brother. I’ve been trying to grow mine for ages, everyone tells me to shave but I’m keeping it to annoy people. When I saw Nat’s, though, I just thought, ‘He’s ruined it’. His is huge and makes me look like a nine year old boy. It’s a proper beard, you could certainly hide some squirrels in there. Nat Borchers holds up a timber slab after Portland beat FC Dallas 3-1 earlier this month . The whole family of 12 is flying out and I had Dad doing some jobs around the house to prepare. He’s sorted the outdoor parasols and kegerator, which lets you have beer on tap. I’ve been practising the table tennis ready for a comp with my brothers. One of them, Gavin, is a travel freak and he’s already bought a book on what to do. There are a lot of vineyards we can visit and we want to trek up Mount Hood, the highest point in Oregon. It is technically an active volcano, though I read the chances of an eruption in the next 30 years are about three per cent, so I think we’ll be alright. You can ski its slopes and canoe its rivers. I’d like to stay in a log cabin on a night off. There is no TV and you’re right out in the wilderness, surrounded by woods. Hopefully it will be a good summer. I’ll be wearing my Thomas Royall shorts when the sun shines. We have just designed our summer 16 range, and had more enquiries from shops. I give my input when I wake up. To organise the current range we went to a hotel in London (during the MLS winter break) and sifted through thousands of prints laid out in front of us, more or less going off our instincts. Your eyes are popping out by the end of the meeting. Hopefully we’ll see the shorts out in Vegas. A lot of the success is down to our model Stephen James Hendry. We picked him because we needed to stand out and project the funky hairstyles and tattoos you see around Shoreditch and Hoxton. Our photographer Adam recommended him. He was very much in demand. He’s a lovely fella. We went out for a meal and he likes to talk football and we like to talk fashion. It’s been great. After Dallas we lost at home to Orlando, who were inspired by Kaka. He kept it simple with one-twos and his presence on the pitch was clear. Kaka (front centre) poses for a photo alongside his Orlando City team-mates ahead of the Portland match . Kaka (left) on the ball with Montreal Impact's Nigel Reo-Coker giving chase during a match last month . It was frustrating not to do better but I watched him play in the World Cup so to walk out with him and be captain on the same day was a real privilege. On the pendant handover I said good luck but that was about it. I don’t know if he knows English, Gracias and Bonjour is my lingo limit. We redeemed ourselves in the next game at New York City, winning 1-0. The clean sheet was hugely satisfying. When I first signed my professional contract with Aston Villa I took the family to America and New York. We did all the shows but not Yankee Stadium, so it was surreal to play on that grass. I got a couple of pictures standing on the pitcher’s mound. To win there was special. David Villa didn’t play because of injury but hopefully I can face him later on this campaign. New York City FC's David Villa (right) looks to leave New England Revolution's Scott Caldwell in his wake . Up next on Sunday night US time are Seattle Sounders, our fiercest rivals. I would say local but the city is about 150 miles away. There will be 65,000 there and the atmosphere promises to be intense, louder than a Villa-Blues derby. Last season I was on the bench as I had just signed and wasn’t able to play. I sat looking at the thousands of fans, the fireworks, and the flags thinking ‘Wow’. I knew I had made the right call to come to the MLS. Portland Timbers players run out onto the field ahead of clash with rivals Seattle Sounders in 2013 .

"Authorities have released the name of a woman who was fatally shot when officers say she fired at them from the back of a patrol car in downtown Atlanta. The Fulton County medical examiner's office identified the woman as 25-year-old Alexia Christian. The incident happened on Thursday afternoon near the Fulton County Courthouse in downtown Atlanta. Major Darin Schierbaum said police were investigating a call about a stolen car when the two officers saw Christian sitting inside the vehicle in a parking deck. Scroll down for video . Christian was killed by police after she allegedly opened fire on them while sitting in the back of a cop car near the Fulton County Courthouse in downtown Atlanta on Thursday . At one point Christian fired at least two shots at the officers, and they returned fire, critically wounding her . Schierbaum said Christian was taken into custody and placed in a patrol car. He said that at one point she fired at least two shots at the officers, and they returned fire, fatally wounding her. Witnesses told AJC.com, people were startled by the gunfire near the downtown intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and Pryor Street. Tressa Madden, who was trying to cross the street at the time, said: 'We heard three shots. 'We heard three more shots and everybody ran back across the street.' She said she saw an officer fire his weapon but could not see who it was aimed at. Another witness, Valencia Riden said she heard several shots as she approached the intersection, but wasn't sure where the shots were being fired. 'We just took off running,' she said. First responders performed CPR before an ambulance arrived, reports Channel 2. She was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital but died from her injuries. Eyewitnesses said Christian had been handcuffed and must have somehow got one hand free to fire a gun. Schierbaum said it was unclear how she was able to fire a gun while in the patrol car and that police are investigating whether she had been handcuffed. Photos from the scene show a pair of handcuffs on the trunk of the squad car. Department spokesman Greg Lyon confirmed the two officers weren't injured. At a press conference last night, he said: 'Atlanta police commanders wanted to release information as quickly as it could be confirmed. 'We owe it to the people we serve to be as transparent as we can in these types of situations.' Police are now looking for surveillance footage from the surrounding area. When probed for details, officials confirmed that both the woman and officers were African American.

"Lada Niva 4x4 £13,395 on the road . As a result of the Land Rover Defender's demise, there could be a boom in sales of a Russian badge which was a butt of many jokes in the Soviet era – the Lada. Lada's 4x4 Niva has long been the car that bucked the trend of laughing at the Russian carmaker and has won fans around the world thanks to its robust nature and chunky looks. We take a look. The Niva (pictured) is a highly capable, ruftytufty 4x4 from Russia — for a fraction of the price of a new Land Rover and it is also available in a compact van format (£10,590, excluding VAT and road tax) GOOD .

But, forget luxuries because the Niva is an unabashed frills-free zone .
A highly capable, ruftytufty 4x4 from Russia — for a fraction of the price of a new Land Rover.
It's a confident charmer that stands out from the crowd, with high suspension, pressed steel wheels, Soviet-style looks and real rarity value. Expect to get gawped at: someone offered to buy mine on its second trip out. Always fun.
Now available in the UK from Niva imports through its dealer, BB Motors, in Corby, Northamptonshire (01536 202207, lada4x4.co.uk).
On the road, the basic 1.7-litre petrol engine (your only option) is deafeningly noisy, but tolerably smooth. Power steering, manageable dimensions and a tight turning circle make it reasonably practical for the supermarket or school run.
The seats are comfy and thanks to a high driving position and large wing mirrors, all-round visibility is good. Top speed is 91 mph.
Off-road, the Niva is in its element, with low and highrange gears, differential lock and a sturdy monocoque construction. It is lighter and more sprightly in the mud than many big-name utility 4x4s, with 220mm ground clearance, a 600mm wading depth and a climbing ability of up to 58 per cent. Tall, slender tyres give it an added advantage when things get mucky.
You won't have to agonise over pages of extras... they're more or less nonexistent. This is a very basic utility vehicle, after all.
Choose in white, blue, green or red, then decide whether you'd like the snorkel or snow plough (really) attachments. An LPG option is available for an extra £999 — but you lose boot space.
Reasonable fuel economy at 33mpg and affordable to insure — once you've explained exactly what it is. Meets Euro 5 emissions standards. The heated blower, presumably designed with Siberia in mind, has plenty of muscle for icy winter mornings.
Also available in a compact van format (£10,590, excluding VAT and road tax).
Spartan on the inside. Forget luxuries such as radios, cup-holders, central locking and electric windows — the Niva is an unabashed frills-free zone. The upside of its simplicity is that the plastic interior is easy to mop down after a day in the mud, and there's not much to break or go wrong.
There are only four seatbelts and a slightly pokey boot.
Don't trust the petrol gauge, which regularly aims to deceive.
No warranty is offered as standard — although a two-year plan is coming soon — and spares may need to be imported (BB Motors will assist).
Only available in lefthand drive — unless you put in an order for more than 500 of them!
Shhhh! You didn't hear it from me. But patriotic Russian President Vladimir Putin made a big play of driving a Lada Niva back in 2009 — but fitted it with a German engine."
"A photograph has been snapped of a man-sized kangaroo flexing his massive guns while hugging a soft toy bunny.

Scroll down for video . Jessica McCarty, pictured with her partner Chris Swist, daughter Lacey McCarty (right) and sons Philip McCarty (center) and Christopher Swist (in her arms), called the police on herself . McCarty was arrested on March 20 and faces three counts of first-degree murder for the incident. Investigators say she left a note behind at the scene saying she was 'sorry for what she had to do' Just 24 hours before their death, he took pictures of the two oldest children at their latest game, and both looked happy as ever, Swist said. 'The kids loved everything about Little League,' Swist told People. 'The past two years, we watched the Little League World Series on ESPN. Our families were always at all the games.' Their love of the sport was so strong that  Palm Bay City Council has renamed a little league field in their town 'Angels' Field' in memory of the children. Swist said that he had a great bond with the children, calling Lacey 'Chick', Christopher 'Toe Toe' and Phillip 'Smash'. As he comes to terms with the tragic deaths of the three kids he loved so much, Swist has created a non-profit organization titled 3 Angels Ball For All, in hopes of helping disadvantaged youth play organizational sports. Jessica McCarty still faces three counts of first-degree murder for the incidents that occurred on March 20. McCarty's partner, Christopher Swist, who she was reportedly on a break with at the time of the alleged murders, coached her two oldest children in little league baseball . Swist, who was only the father of the youngest slain child, said he had a close bond with all three children and gave them all nicknames to go by . Swist called seven-year-old Lacey (right picture, left) 'Chick', five-month-old Christopher (left) 'Toe Toe' and six-year-old Phillip 'Smash' (right). Each nickname supposedly had a story behind it . McCarty was arrested after she called 911 and told police she'd killed her children. Lacey and Philip were found unresponsive in the same room at the home and were pronounced dead that night. The mother strangled the infant and drowned and strangled the daughter, Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens said, according to Florida Today. Police say none of the three children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were found. Christopher Swist had been on life support at Florida Hospital for Children  but lost his fight for life in the days following the attack. 'Our hearts go out to the friends and family who have lost children in such a horrific manner. The fathers of these helpless, innocent children struggling is simply gut wrenching,' said acting Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens said after the incident. According to Renkens, there had recently been a break in the relationship between McCarty and  Swist. Lacey and Phillip where pronounced dead shortly after they were found unresponsive. Christopher held on for a couple days before dying at the hospital . McCarty was arrested after calling 911 on herself and telling the police she had killed her three children . When Swist arrived on scene - after McCarty had sent him photos of blood throughout the house - and found the children unresponsive. He then called the police . Investigators said McCarty sent photos to Swist of blood throughout the house. Swist arrived first at the scene and found his son unresponsive on his bed, police said. Police said they found a journal in the driveway of the home that was addressed 'To my family,' which indicated that McCarty was sorry for what she 'had to do.' There was also another page addressed to Christopher's father, asking him to keep her son's name alive, police said. In a mugshot provided by the local jail, the troubled mother appeared in a suicide-prevention vest with bandages covering her recently-slashed wrists - her mouth agape. The motive for the tragic attempted murder-suicide has not been revealed. However, McCarty did have a troubled history and in 2009 was investigated by the DCF for possible child neglect. The agency recommended McCarty to mental health counseling after that investigation, according to public records. Phillip McCarty (left) was the father of the Phillip and Lacey, the two older children McCarty is believed to have killed on March 20 . McCarty and Swist had one child together - five-month-old Christopher. Police said they were on a break at the time of the incident . She has also been arrested on charges of forgery, shoplifting, and prescription drug abuse. Police were first called to the family's residence just before 6pm, when McCarty called 911 to say her three children were dead and that she had cut her wrists. Swist also called police when he came home. Swist now has the comfort of his city's support in mourning and remembering the three children he loved. 'All I have left is the memories that my children blessed me with,' Swist told People. 'Those moments will forever be ours together. Those children touched so many lives in the community; naming the field after them is a great way to help keep those memories alive.' And he knows he has to push on and have the strength to hold his memories close. 'I don’t think you ever heal from this,' Swist told Space Coast Daily. He added: 'The best we can do is survive. The way we survive is we all stand together as one family. 'As far as you guys even thinking about naming the field, that really means a lot to us. We just can’t say enough. We miss our kids. We miss our kids.' Though Phillip and Lacey were not Swist's biological children, he cared for and loved them both. He claims that the children 'touched so many lives in the community' of Palm Bay .","Christopher Swist was on a break from a relationship with Jessica McCarty when she allegedly killed her children in Palm Bay, Florida, police say .

"The heartbroken mother of a unarmed teen who was shot dead by police has revealed the last words her son spoke as he lay dying in an ambulance. Hector Morejon was shot by a Long Beach, California, police officer, who allegedly thought the 19-year-old was pointing a gun at him during a trespassing and vandalism incident. According to her attorney, his mother, Lucia Morejon, was at home when she heard the shots. Lucia Morejon, the heartbroken mother of a unarmed teen who was shot dead by police has revealed the last words her son, Hector Morejon, 19, spoke as he lay dying in an ambulance . She went to an alley near her home to see what happened and then realized it was her son in the ambulance, reports the LA Times. 'When he saw her, he propped himself partially up and cried to her, 'Mommy, Mommy, please come, please come!' ' her attorney's statement said, reports the Press Telegram. 'She walked towards the ambulance, identified herself as his mother, expecting to ride with him to the hospital, but was pushed back by a man in a blue uniform.' Her attorney Sonia Mercado told The Huffington Post: 'He was reaching for her - reaching out to her for help.' 'It's a tough thing to live with as a parent,' said Mercado. 'She is deeply in shock.' Hector Morejon, 19, was shot dead by a police officer on Thursday while in a vacant apartment . The Press Telegram reports that according to the statement, Lucia Morejon asked what happened but was not given any information. It continues: 'At the hospital, Mrs. Mojeron and her family were not allowed to see Hector until he was dead.' In a statement released Monday, the family of Hector Morejon said they are requesting that the LBPD 'immediately release the name and badge number of the officer who is responsible for killing Hector who was unarmed.' Police said officers received a report that several people were trespassing and vandalizing an empty apartment at about 2:45 p.m. Thursday. When they attended they saw there was an open window and a broken window. According to an LBPD press release, an officer looked into the apartment through the broken window and saw a man (later identified as Morejon) standing against a wall. The press release states the officer saw the man turn toward him, while bending his knees and extending his arm out, as if pointing an object which the officer perceived as a gun. The officer then fired, according to police. Morejon,from Long Beach, was initially listed in critical condition, but was later pronounced dead at a hospital. No weapons were found at the scene. 'Objects were collected from the scene, but it has not been yet determined at this point in the investigation if those objects were what the officer observed,' said Sgt. Megan Zabel, a Police Department spokeswoman told the LA Times. 'We are not describing evidentiary detail on what those objects are at this time, as with how many times the suspect was shot.' Police said the apartment was spray-painted with gang-related graffiti. The family reject suggestions that the teen was a gang member. According to a statement from the LBPD to the Long Beach Post, the department 'thoroughly reviews all use of force incidents through a rigorous multi-step process that evaluates legal, policy, tactical and equipment issues. 'In addition, all officer involved shootings where a death occurs, are independently investigated by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office and the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office.'","Hector Morejon was shot by a Long Beach, California, police officer .

"Ahead of the 79th edition of the Masters, Sportsmail counts down the 20 greatest shots ever seen at Augusta National Golf Club. Here are Nos 10-1. CLICK HERE for the first part of our countdown, featuring videos of shots from the likes of Nick Faldo, Louis Oosthuizen and the late, great Seve Ballesteros... 10 Arnold Palmer, 1960 . The King was truly crowned after becoming the first man to birdie both the final two holes at Augusta National to win the Masters. Palmer had already sunk a 35-footer on the 17th to tie Ken Venturi at the top of the leaderboard, but knew a birdie on the last would win him the title. His approach to the 18th green was magnificent, finishing six feet away, sending ‘Arnie’s Army’ wild. He holed out for his second of four green jackets. 9 Sandy Lyle, 1988 . Needing a birdie to beat Mark Calcavecchia, Sandy Lyle sent his 1-iron tee shot into the bunker guarding the left side of the fairway. But the Scotsman’s strike from the sand was so pure that he was able to send his ball into the heart of the green, and watched as it caught that famous downslope and rolled to within eight feet of the pin. The birdie putt was never in doubt, and the jig that followed is just as memorable as that remarkable bunker shot. Sandy Lyle (right) is presented with his green jacket by Larry Mize in 1988 . 8 Phil Mickelson, 2010 . You could fill this top 20 entirely with shots from Phil the Thrill if you so wished, but this one probably tops his personal highlights reel. Having pulled his tee shot on the par-five 13th right and into trees, Mickelson was left with a gap of just a couple of feet through which to thread his ball. But ignoring the pleas of his caddie Jim ‘Bones’ Mackay to lay up, Phil took his six-iron and blasted the ball from off the straw, through the eye of the pines needle, over Rae’s Creek and to five feet of the pin. The eagle putt didn’t drop, but the marker was set. Lee Westwood was brilliant that year, but no-one was going to beat Mickelson on this form. 7 Doug Ford, 1957 . Trailing Sam Snead by three strokes after three rounds, Doug Ford stood over his approach to the 18th on Sunday with a one-shot lead after a brilliant back nine, but fired his 7-iron into a bunker. Worse than that, the ball plugged in the sand, leaving Snead probably needing a par to force a play-off or birdie to win the title. But Ford blasted his ball out of the trap and straight into the cup for an incredible birdie. It sealed his second major title and only Masters win, but his name will now forever be associated with that greenside bunker on 18. Jack Nicklaus (left) leaps into the air after holing his magnificent putt on the 16th green in 1975 . 6 Jack Nicklaus, 1975 . As the Golden Bear reached his ball on the 16th green, he heard the roars from the 15th as Tom Weiskopf holed for a one-stroke lead. Worse, his ball was over 40 feet from the pin after a poor tee shot. A two-putt from that position would have been a good result, but Nicklaus had other ideas and stroked the ball round the contours of the green and straight into the cup. Weiskopf three-putted the same green, Nicklaus won by a single shot, and the defeated giant later described Nicklaus’ shot as the best putt he had ever seen. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE SHOT . 5 Larry Mize, 1987 . Augusta probably held little hope for this local lad when he entered a play-off with the legendary Seve Ballesteros and the Great White Shark, Greg Norman, for the green jacket in 1987. Although the Spaniard dropped out after a bogey on the first play-off hole, Norman was in pole position after finding the fringe at the 11th, while Mize missed the green way to the right. But there’s just something about this hole, and Mize sent his 100-foot chip up onto the green and leapt nearly as high into the air after it hit the flagstick and dropped into the hole. Norman missed his putt and will forever be remembered as Augusta’s bridesmaid. 4 Gene Sarazen, 1935 . Who knows what The Masters might have become without this shot? At the time it wasn’t considered a major and was struggling to gain recognition, but in one stroke Gene Sarazen’s ‘shot heard round the world’ put Augusta National on the map. The Squire was trailing Craig Wood by two on the par-five 15th, but smashed a 235-yard four wood over water and into the cup for an albatross (or double eagle, as they like to say over the pond). Sarazen’s remarkable shot helped him tie Wood and go on to beat him in an 18-hole play-off the next day. More importantly, it was the first of many legends born at The Masters. 3 Bubba Watson, 2012 . Having hooked his drive deep into the trees on the 10th, the second hole of his play-off with Louis Oosthuizen, Bubba Watson looked dead and buried. But Bubba used all his magical shotmaking skills to spot a gap in the trees and then somehow hook a 160-yard wedge nearly 90 degrees and onto the putting surface. Not only that, but his ball stopped 15 feet from the pin and piled the pressure onto Oosthuizen, who could only bogey. Tears flowed and ‘Blubber’ Watson sealed his place in Augusta folklore. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO . Bubba Watson hit a shot no-one thought was possible by hooking his ball round trees onto the 10th green . 2 Jack Nicklaus, 1986 . Aged 46 and having not won a major for six years, many thought the Golden Bear had lost his teeth, but his back nine at Augusta was nothing short of the best golf of his career. Nicklaus covered his final 10 holes in seven under par and made a host of brilliant shots, but none better than his tee shot at 16, which finished four feet from the cup to set up an easy birdie. Watch as Nicklaus bends down to pick up his tee with the ball in mid-air. As everyone around held their breath, he knew from the moment it left the clubface exactly where it was going. It doesn’t get much cooler than that. Apart, maybe, from winning a sixth Masters, and 18th major title. Jack Nicklaus (right) won a record sixth green jacket with his unforgettable back nine in 1986 . 1 Tiger Woods, 2005 . It couldn’t be anything else, surely? Woods’ legend was well and truly sealed with this jaw-dropping, gravity-defying chip-in, despite the fact he bogeyed his next two holes and was forced to beat Chris DiMarco in a play-off for his fourth green jacket. Tiger was left in a near-hopeless position down in a hollow after missing the 16th green long, but chipped up onto a slope way left of the hole. His ball came to a virtual standstill, before trickling downhill towards the pin, and stopped rolling right on the edge of the cup just long enough to reveal his sponsor’s logo before dropping in. Cue bedlam and what will surely go down as the most famous shot in all of golf. Tiger Woods celebrates with his caddie Steve Williams after holing his chip from off the 16th green .","The 79th Masters Tournament begins on Thursday at Augusta National .

"An investigation has concluded Freddie Gray broke his neck after falling head-first into the back of the police van as it was moving, it was reported today. Medical and law enforcement sources briefed on the police investigation told ABC News Gray's 'catastrophic' head injuries were consistent with hitting a bolt 'in the back door of the van'. They claimed there was 'no evidence' Gray sustained a fatal spine injury during his arrest, which was caught on camera on a street side on April 12. According to ABC's sources, Gray was standing in the van, bent over with his hand cuffed behind his back and his head pointing towards the back door. It is believed he fell into the door, breaking his neck. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A report claims Freddie Gray broke his neck when he fell head-first into the back of the van as it was moving . Similar van: Freddie Gray was stood, bent over, with his head facing the back door of a van like this . Timeline? It is believed Gray fell head-first into the back of the van, breaking his neck, during the journey . Inside: The above diagram shows the inside the police van . Pictured: The second stop which police failed to report in their paperwork after the van journey, during which Freddie Gray sustained a 'catastrophic' head injury. It was picked up by a privately-owned security camera . According to the latest police press conference, these are the stops the van made transporting Freddie Gray . The news comes hours after Baltimore Police admitted the van transporting Gray made a previously unreported stop. The mysterious detail was picked up by a privately-owned security camera, and will be integral to the police investigation into Gray's death, which was completed and handed to the state prosecutor on Thursday morning. It is not known why the van stopped at the corner of North Fremont Ave and Mosher Street before it made another two stops then finally transported Gray to the hospital. And police have yet to clarify why Gray would have been standing without a seat belt on. Just nine days before his arrest, the Baltimore Police Department issued a new policy, making it obligatory to belt all inmates placed in the back of a transport van. Revelation: Police Commissioner Anthony Batts revealed a private security camera captured the van making an unknown stop. He refused to elaborate on the details of the new information . Police Commissioner Anthony Batts refused to elaborate on the new information. He said the contents of the report, which was completed and handed to the State Attorney at 8.50am Thursday, will remain confidential as they continue to investigate. Six officers have been suspended with pay over the incident, and the department has admitted Gray - who was asthmatic - should have been given the medical help he requested. The report that Gray fell inside the van corroborates claims he was given a 'rough ride' by the van driver, who is the only officer yet to deliver a statement to the investigators, according to ABC. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton. As the police department, Mayor's office, and state prosecutors refuse to address the development, it has done nothing but fuel anger and speculation surrounding the circumstances of Gray's arrest more than two weeks ago. A relative of one of the suspended police officers told CNN she believes Gray was injured during his arrest outside the van. Her family member, she said, was based inside the van, and she fears he will be made a scapegoat for something he 'didn't do'. However, this theory is at odds with the medical examiner's report which allegedly found Gray sustained injuries by falling over inside the van, where he had been placed without a seat belt. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN her family member was in the van with Gray as he screamed and cried for medical help. But she believes the spinal injury which led to Gray's death was inflicted earlier, during his arrest on April 12. In an appeal that echoes Gray's family, she is calling for the police department to conduct a thorough investigation that will determine which of the six suspended police officers dealt the fatal blow. 'Six officers did not injure this man,' she told Don Lemon. Secret stop: This is the corner where the police van was spotted making a previously unreported stop . These are the security cameras outside a grocery which picked up the secret stop . Jung Hwang's convenience store's camera footage revealed a new stop the police van made while transporting Freddie Gray . 'Six officers didn't put him in the hospital. 'I'm worried that instead of them figuring out who did, that six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie Gray.' Her words came after a police document was leaked to the Washington Post, in which the other prisoner in the transport van with Gray said he could hear the 25-year-old slamming himself against the wall. The prisoner speculated that Gray was trying to hurt himself. In the documents, the unidentified prisoner says he was loaded into a police van after Gray on April 12, and apparently told investigators that he heard Gray 'banging against the walls' and 'intentionally trying to injure himself'. However, he admits he could not see what Gray was doing, since they were separated by a metal partition. The statement was cited in a warrant to search an arresting officer's clothing for possible traces of Gray's DNA. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton . The assertion that Gray may have caused his own death in the back of the police van was quickly rejected by an attorney hired by his family. 'We disagree with any implication that Freddie Gray severed his own spinal cord,' attorney Jason Downs told the Post. 'We question the accuracy of the police reports we've seen thus far, including the police report that says Mr Gray was arrested without force or incident.' Outrage over the unexplained death of a black man in Baltimore, Maryland prompted nationwide protests against police brutality on Wednesday from Houston to Boston. Baltimore has been the scene of near-nightly protests ever since the April 19 death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who is believed to have been fatally injured while in police custody. State Attorney Marilyn Mosby urged the public to be patient as she reviews the information. 'While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified,' Mosby said on Thursday. 'We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.' Freddie Gray: The 25-year-old was poisoned by lead paint as a child growing up in Baltimore . Freddie Gray was a 25-year-old African-American who grew up in Baltimore's impoverished west side . Nicknamed 'Pepper', he was described by an ex-girlfriend as happy-go-lucky with an infectious sense of humor. The Baltimore police knew him, however, as a 5ft-8ins felon who had notched up at least 18 arrests and a handful of convictions - mainly for Class A drugs but also burglary, assault and illegal gambling. He was said to have set off running at the sight of police patrolling a well known open-air drug market. He was taken into custody for possession of a switchblade and during transport to the station he experienced what officers described as 'a medical emergency'. Gray, who had asthma, requested an inhaler and had trouble breathing in the van, but police didn't provide his inhaler. According to Gray's family his spine was severed 80 per cent at his neck, three vertebrae were fractured and his larynx was injured. Court papers describe Gray's childhood as problematic. He lived with his heroin-addicted disabled mother in a home in Sandtown-Winchester that contained enough poisonous lead in the peeling painted walls and windowsills for a court settlement to conclude that he and his two sisters were incapable of leading normal functioning lives. Lab tests conducted in the 1990s showed that they had levels of lead in their blood nearly double what the state of Maryland defines as the minimum for lead poisoning. In Baltimore, more than 2,600 children have been found to have high levels of lead in their blood, according an annual report released by the Maryland Department of the Environment in 2014. 'This is the toxic legacy of lead-based paint,” Ruth Ann Norton, head of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative and a founding member of the Maryland Lead Poisoning Prevention Commission, told the Baltimore Sun. 'Our kids are ill equipped to stay in the classroom, finish school. They’re very unlikely to go on to higher education. They’re less likely to be able to hold a job', she said. 'They’re less equipped to be able to overcome the poverty and other circumstances that pull them down. Children with lead poisoning will have defects, regardless of whether their parents are ‘nice’ or not.' Gray lived off the resulting 'lead check' settlement although it is unclear exactly how much he received. Whatever money he did have he was said to spend buying designer accessories. The Sandtown neighborhood is a 72-block neighborhood made up of almost entirely of African Americans. More than one-third of residents live below the poverty line, and nearly a quarter are unemployed. The majority of Maryland's state prison population are said to said to hail from Sandtown, according to the Justice Policy Institute.","Medical examiner 'found Freddie Gray's catastrophic head injury was consistent with bolt in the back door of the police van'

"With summer around the corner, icy treats are back on the menu. But if there is one phase transition in which food can become frustrating – by giving us brain freeze and by getting painfully stuck to our mouths – then it is when it is frozen. As a fly – perhaps the creature you would least expect to be in this position – found out when it swooped in to have a lick of a frozen beef steak. The fly is initially featured looking rather pleased as it fastens its tongue onto the beef steak and has a taste . Like the infamous scene from Dumb and Dumber involving ice, a ski lift and a tongue, the fly becomes attached to the frozen food. Videoed up-close, the fly is initially captured enjoying itself as it fastens its big tongue onto the beef steak and has a taste. Satisfied, it then goes to fly away home when suddenly it notices that it is stuck and a sense of panic sets in. Realising that its tongue is stuck to the frozen beef steak, the fly begins squirming in its attempts to break free . Moving its legs, the fly at first attempts to walk away, before arching its back and trying with all its might to pull itself free. It tries this two more times, but much to its annoyance it stays attached to the beef steak as it stops to look at the camera. As the video goes on the fly tries harder and harder to set itself free – beating its legs, heaving itself backwards and twisting slightly.

But nothing seems to work and as it slumps, looking sorry for itself, all appears to have been lost. Luckily for the fly however, help emerges in the form of a human thumb, which attempts to set it free with a little prod. Failing this, the video maker then picks up a little heat gun and begins thawing out the ice around the fly and ultimately setting it free. The video was recorded in Auckland, New Zealand.

"Albert Park - Australian Grand Prix . Sepang - Malaysian Grand Prix . Shanghai arrived with a bang in Formula One and while races in recent seasons haven't quite had the same excitement seen during its early years, there is enough substance for it to be an intriguing watch on race day. For instance whether the Chinese Grand Prix is held as a potential title decider late on in the year (2004-2008) or as an early opener (2009-present) it can often be hit with outside variables; wet conditions often sprinkling some unpredictability over a weekend. The track layout is also a challenging design. Herman Tilke ensures he gets his long straight and hairpin turn in, but it flows like Malaysia and offers great reward for getting the line through the sequence of fast turns spot on, in the middle of the lap especially. A decent run out on to the back straight is a catalyst for the classic trademark move going into the penultimate corner. Even the pit lanes can be challenging (you'll see if you scroll down) which brings us nicely on to the latest in Sportsmail's series of Grand Prix memories... The Shanghai circuit held the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix in 2004 and has been home to the event ever since. Here is a picture shortly before its first race, with the grandstand and pit straight seen towards the back. It sure seems a long walk from the huge car park... Ricardo Zonta featured late on in the 2004 season, and is pictured in his Toyota during qualifying with the main grandstand in the background. The Brazilian had replaced the sacked Cristiano da Matta but this would be his penultimate race start in Formula One . Having been dropped by BAR for 2004, there was plenty of attention on Jacques Villeneuve when he returned to the F1 grid for the Chinese Grand Prix. In his traditional baggy overalls, the 1997 world champion poses with team boss Flavio Briatore having joined Renault for the final three races of the season following the team's dismissal of Jarno Trulli . The cameras are all on Villenueve as he emerges from the garage for his first Renault run, but the gamble to hire the Canadian backfired as he failed to score a single point for the team who would lose out to BAR in the fight for second in the constructors' championship . What's up, Fernando?! Jaguar's Mark Webber, Toyota's Olivier Panis and BAR's Takuma Sato all take a moment to wave to the Shanghai crowd in 2004, but Alonso looks far from amused with his shades on and a glum looking face to match . Given the dominance of Ferrari at the time, very few would have guessed that Rubens Barrichello's 2004 win would be his last for the team. At least he looks like he is making the most of it as he celebrates with Kimi Raikkonen, with the Finn finishing third behind Jenson Button . In a totally bizarre incident, Michael Schumacher steps out his wreck of a Ferrari which rests on the side of the track. The German collided with Christijan Albers' Minardi while driving out the pit-lane to the grid before the start of the 2005 race - both would compete in a spare car . It's all smiles at Renault as they celebrate clinching the constructors' title in the last race of the 2005 season ahead of McLaren. It capped off a perfect year for the team with Fernando Alonso (centre) becoming world champion and Giancarlo Fisichella (holding trophy aloft) proving a capable rear gunner as they recaptured success not seen since the team's previous incarnation as Benetton in 1995 . The 2005 race in Shanghai also proved to be the end of an era as the popular underdogs Minardi raced for the final time. Team boss Paul Stoddart proudly holds off a pit board showing their record of 340 races since 1985 alongside team staff and drivers Robert Doornbos (left) and Christijan Albers. Thankfully the team remained in the sport and survive to this day in its current guise as Toro Rosso . It wasn't just Minardi departing in 2005 as Jordan would also race for the final time before becoming Force India. But Narain Karthikeyan would only last 28 laps before an accident ended his race. Here, race winner Fernando Alonso zips past in his Renault, with the Indian driver seen in his yellow overalls observing the wreckage on the opposite side of the track . Shanghai in 2006 provided one of its most dramatic races. Fernando Alonso was in control before his decision to pit for scrubbed front intermediate tyres would come back to haunt him. The Spaniard was in a title fight with Michael Schumacher who, in the background, quickly caught the struggling Renault. Gianarclo Fisichella tries to provide a protective barrier to his team-mate, but so slow was Alonso that even the Italian had to pass him - with Schumacher soon following . Schumcaher would also go on to pass Fisichella and claim a very famous victory which saw the title race swing dramatically in the favour of the Ferrari star. The agony and ecstasy from the Renault and Ferrari drivers on the podium tells its own story with Alonso and Fisichella looking devastated and puzzled at how they lost the race . With his Ferrari team right behind him, Schumacher celebrates his unlikely win in parc ferme. The German's record in the Chinese Grand Prix was otherwise poor this race aside, but his famous 2006 victory would be his 91st and final Grand Prix victory in his career . Just when you thought 2006 couldn't be beaten, the following year's grand prix served up one of the pivotal  moments of the 2007 season. Rookie Lewis Hamilton tried to drag a set of beaten up intermediate tyres as long as he could around the circuit and did the hard bit by staying on the road. But when coming to pit in for new rubber, he somehow beached his McLaren in a gravel trap. Here the Brit reacts to a horrendous error with a marshall offering assistance. The right rear tyre shows just how little rubber was left on his tyre as he pitted . In a double blow for Hamilton, it was title rival Kimi Raikkonen who would benefit as the Ferrari star would go on to win the race and eventually the championship later on in the season by just one point. The Finn is shown a board to let him know he is starting his final lap . But Lewis would bounce back in 2008 as he sussed out the correct route to the pit-lane and in doing so found the key to grabbing victory. Here, the McLaren driver celebrates his win with his mother Carmen Lockhart and his step mother Linda Hamilton in parc ferme . Hide and seek Formula One style? No, it's just Nico Rosberg trying to push his Williams out of the tyre barrier following a crash during Saturday practice ahead of the 2009 race . Get out of the spray! As the safety car prepares to come in during 2009, Sebastian Vettel leads the pack in his Red Bull with team-mate Mark Webber, the Brawns of Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button, and the Toyota of Jarno Trulli seeking a line on the track where they are not blinded by spray on a wet afternoon in Shanghai . Spray would prove no problem for Vettel, who punches the air with delight after securing Red Bull's first ever win in 2009 much to the joy of team members on the pit wall. The race was the first year in which the grand prix was hosted earlier in the season where it remains . Sebastien Buemi suffered a terrifying crash just shy of 200mph during the first practice session ahead of the 2010 event, as flying down the long back straight both of his front wheels simultaneously broke off leaving him without any steering and just rear brakes to stop. Thankfully a large run off area and a gravel trap left him enough room to significantly reduce his speed before he slid along a barrier coming to a safe stop . Two fantastic drivers of their respective generations duel at the hairpin on the back straight, but sadly the best of Michael Schumacher (left) had long since passed as McLaren's Lewis Hamilton prepares to drive round the outside of the Mercedes star in 2010 . But it was Hamilton's team-mate Jenson Button who would claim 2010 victory - with the duo exchanging a warm hand-shake on the podium . Hamilton was shaking more hands a year later but this time it was as the grand prix winner, as Red Bull's Mark Webber, who finished third, greets the McLaren driver in parc ferme after the race. The triumph made Hamilton the first multi-time winner at Shanghai . Nico Rosberg leads the pack out of the first twisty opening section in front of Mercedes team-mate Michael Schumacher as McLaren's Jenson Button follows in third. Rosberg would go on to win the 2012 race which would be his first in his Formula One career . Mercedes team members rush to the pit-wall to greet Rosberg on his victory, which was the first for the team since 1955. Mercedes had only re-entered F1 as a team again in 2010 after taking over from the one-season wonders Brawn - who had previously been Honda . Fernando Alonso leads the celebrations as he holds a Ferrari flag in front of his delighted team following his 2013 win. The Spaniard looked like he could lead a Ferrari title fight following this victory, but he has only won one grand prix since. Can you name where and when it was? (Answer is at the bottom of the page) The story of 2014?

"Albert Park - Australian Grand Prix . Sepang - Malaysian Grand Prix . Shanghai - Chinese Grand Prix . Out of the Chinese swamp, where the Shanghai Circuit was built, and straight into the desert of Bahrain - only in a Formula One World Championship. But as the F1 circus quickly ends up in Bahrain after the Chinese Grand Prix, some things don't appear to have changed at all as, like Shanghai, Sakhir debuted in 2004 and is designed by Herman Tilke. It's also a trailblazer. Bahrain was the first country in the middle east to hold a Formula One world championship Grand Prix but it has been rocked by a number of issues in recent years. National protests led to the event being cancelled in 2011, with many questioning whether Sakhir should be holding a Grand Prix from a political stand point. The circuit itself hasn't quite delivered many spectacular races, and you will be hard pressed to create a top five Bahrain Grand Prix list. That doesn't mean we have had 10 years of Bahrain bores though as Sportsmail takes a look back at our favourite images through the Sakhir archives. There was still two months to go before the inaugural Bahrain Grand Prix in 2004 when this photo was taken, and you won't be surprised to know little has changed since in the desert. The in-field has had a cosmetic makeover, while after the tight turn to the right of your picture you can follow the extended endurance version of the track which was raced in 2010 to mark 50 years of the F1 world championship . There isn't much to look at for scenery in Sakhir, but the corporate building in the background near the paddock is the iconic construction at the circuit. It was certainly more attractive than the Williams 'walrus' nose as driven by Ralf Schumacher in 2004 . David Coulthard appears to have stumbled upon an idea on how to make the McLaren go faster in 2004, as he pushes his car following a spin in practice. The Scot would retire on race day with an engine problem after 50 laps - but he lasted 43 laps longer than team-mate Kimi Raikkonen who also suffered a Mercedes failure inside his McLaren . Form a line behind the great one. Michael Schumacher won the first race at Sakhir as he leads in front of Ferrari team-mate Rubens Barrichello, Williams' Ralf Schumacher and the BAR duo of Takuma Sato and Jenson Button on the run up to turn three . It's all smiles at BAR in 2004 as Jenson Button celebrates a podium finish with his father John and team boss Dave Richards - who toasts the Brit's third-place finish with a cigar. Button's podium in Sakhir came straight after his first in Formula One at Sepang . Abdel Rouf, a member of the Bahrainian Royal Arab Studs, wasn't lacking horse power as he watched Renault's Giancarlo Fisichella pass by while sitting on Tuwasian during the fourth practice session ahead of the 2005 race . Health and safety folk would have a fit seeing scenes like this these days, as the Renault team hang off the pit fence to congratulate Fernando Alonso on his win in the 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix. The practice was soon banned with teams having to now remain behind the fence . One hundred wins for Fernando already? Not quite. Renault, along with Alonso, celebrate their 100th win over the course of their Formula One history which also included victories as an engine supplier to Williams and Benetton in the 1990s . Spot the new guy. The Schumacher brothers of Michael and Ralf stand in parc ferme alongside Williams' Nico Rosberg and Sauber's Nick Heidfeld as part of the German quartet waiting to speak to the country's TV feed. Rosberg, making his F1 debut, looks very nervous at the thought of it but would shatter all judgment by going on to post the fastest lap in the race - at 20 years-old he is the youngest ever to do so . Kimi Raikkonen is just a passenger as his McLaren suffers a rear wing and a suspension failure at high speed during qualifying in 2006 . Raikkonen wasn't hurt following the crash but it looks like McLaren's side pod sponsor has some wise words for the Finn as an alternate option to stepping back into a car, which would underperform throughout the 2006 season . Strike a pose, Fernando. Alonso celebrates back-to-back Bahrain victories in front of Renault team boss Flavio Briatore with a unique stance - something which would become a feature during the Spaniard's championship year in 2006 . It's the rundown to the first corner  and the leading drivers of 2007 duel it out as Felipe Massa (right) leads in his Ferrari. The McLarens of Lewis Hamilton (left), Fernando Alonso and Massa's team-mate Raikkonen follow into turn one in a race which left the trio locked on 22 points after the race. Only a point would separate them come the end of the season in the Finn's favour . That's quite a traffic jam behind the Super Aguri of Takuma Sato in 2007 but who are the Formula One stars desperately trying to get past the back marker? Answers are at the bottom of the page . Lewis Hamilton certainly made his mark the previous year by finishing on the podium, but he did it in different circumstances in 2008 after crashing during second free practice. Hamilton observes his wreck of a McLaren as the yellow flags are waved . Massa and BMW's Robert Kubica vie for the lead at the start of the race - albeit via the scenic route - as the Ferrari star recorded back-to-back victories in 2008. For those wondering how the majority of the sand stays off the track at Sakhir, it is sprayed with an adhesive to prevent it blowing onto the asphalt. Kubica's sand spray in the run-off area shows what the Bahrain Grand Prix might look like without it . Being so far in front of everyone was a common feature of Jenson Button's early 2009 season, and as the Brawn driver celebrates on top of his car to mark his third win in four races, Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel (centre) and Toyota's Jarno Trulli have only just come to a halt in parc ferme . It was a dream Ferrari debut for Fernando Alonso who won the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix which used the one-off full endurance version of the Sakhir track. Around the first two corners, the Spaniard leads team-mate Felipe Massa, McLaren's Lewis Hamilton and the Mercedes duo of Nico Rosberg and Michael Schumacher. It's Mark Webber whose smokey Red Bull makes life rather difficult for those behind him . The 2010 race was Schumacher's first in the sport following a sensational return after a three-season absence but the German struggled as he holds up Webber, Button and the Force India of Viantonio Liuzzi before going on to finish sixth in his Mercedes . Was this the start of Hamilton's split from McLaren? The team failing to get the basics right as they struggle with the left rear wheel in a pit-stop cost the Brit in 2012 and led to Hamilton shaking his head in disappointment. In the background you can see TV pit-lane reporter Ted Kravitz having a perfect view of the carnage in process as he relays the info into his microphone and back to millions of TV screens . But where is the alcohol? The 2012 race winner Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull pours rosewater over second-placed Lotus driver Kimi Raikkonen who seems keen on drinking in the non-alcoholic celebratory drink. With alcohol banned from the region, the traditional champagne celebration is barred from the podium at Bahrain . It's 2012 all over again as Vettel (right) wins in 2013 in front of Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean. The most striking element of this picture though is Ferrari's Fernando Alonso getting out the car in the blurred forefront after finishing eighth and having to watch the celebrations unfold. The former double world champion is very much on the outside looking into the room of success . To mark the tenth anniversary of the Bahrain Grand Prix the 2014 event was held as a night race as the Mercedes duo in typical fashion lead the grid into the first corner with Rosberg (right) and Hamilton neck-and-neck . Sauber's Esteban Gutierrez is just about in every wrong position a Formula One driver would want to be in as facing the wrong way and upside down in the air, he looks straight into the eyes (or visor) of Lotus driver Pastor Maldonado in 2014 following a crash between the pair . Maldonado had clipped the Mexican heading into the first corner which sent the Sauber driver into a spin he would have hardly had time to process what had happened before the crash had come to a halt . Thankfully Gutierrez was unhurt following the crash which ended with four wheels on the ground and the Mexican the right way up - albeit with wrecked suspension, broken front and rear wings and a race retirement. Maldonado served a five-place grid penalty for causing the incident . Other than Maldonado and Gutierrez's crash, 2014 will also be remembered for a tremendous scrap up front as Hamilton just about held off a rampaging Rosberg to win for the first time at Sakhir . 2004: Michael Schumacher (Ferrari) 2005: Fernando Alonso (Renault) 2006: Fernando Alonso (Renault) 2007: Feliep Massa (Ferrari) 2008: Felipe Massa (Ferrari) 2009: Jenson Button (Brawn) 2010: Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) 2012: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) 2013: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) 2014: Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) Bold indicates driver still active on Formula One grid .

Fireworks lit up the desert night and sparks glowed from under the cars, but nothing shone brighter in the Bahrain Grand Prix than the luminous talent of Lewis Hamilton. Such is his form at the start of the season that we could easily mistake the extraordinary for the routine. The hard facts are that Hamilton’s third win in four races extends his lead in the championship to 27 points over his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. But the British driver’s performances are almost certainly the most complete of his startling career.

His goal is to match Sir Jackie Stewart’s record of three titles, as we were all reminded when the Scot, who competed in a different and more dangerous age, conducted the podium interviews. Stewart has occasionally been a critic of Hamilton, and not without his reasons, but he was happy to acknowledge on Sunday night that the reigning double world champion is ‘the best out there at the moment’. Hamilton’s faultless behaviour extended to the celebratory spraying of rose water — the substitute drink in these religiously more abstemious countries. There was no repeat of his turning the fizz on a somewhat trapped stewardess as he did in China seven days earlier. In place of that unchivalrous act, he acted with total restraint, looking at the grey-suited women at the side of the presentation party but studiously keeping his distance. Hamilton’s joy must have been immense though. He had beaten Rosberg, a specialist in Bahrain, in qualifying and in the race. Whether the German can recover from this kind of mauling is open to question. However well he drives, he may never be a match for Hamilton at his greatest . The championship dynamic developed in another important way: the Ferraris of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen look set to stay in the hunt. The internal rivalry at Ferrari may be as important to the outcome of the title as the one, albeit potentially fading, at Mercedes. Raikkonen was second with a strong drive from fourth on the grid, a place ahead of Rosberg, who drove with real gusto but struggled with brake problems. It was always going to be hard to match the front-to-back excitement of last year’s race here. This edition did not reach those towering standards, but there was still a smattering of thrills during the 57 laps of a race whose efficient organisation, friendly paddock, and perfectly choreographed lights are a model of excellence for all grand prix hosts to emulate. The race started with a close dance between the leading cars. Rosberg, in desperate need of a spark to light his championship challenge, dived down the right of the straight, was blocked by Vettel, and then overtaken by Raikkonen as the second corner swept round to the left. But Rosberg harried Raikkonen’s red machine until he made his brave — arguably reckless — move going into the first corner at the start of the fourth lap. It worked, just. Hamilton turned in a strong display at the Sakhir International Circuit to win in Bahrain for the second consecutive year . Hamilton leads the early phase of the grand prix from the Ferrari pair of Sebastian Vettel, who finished fifth, and Kimi Raikkonen . Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene was unimpressed, the Italian mouthing a few words of pure Anglo-Saxon. Hamilton, meanwhile, was running serenely at the front. Rosberg was on a charge. He got close to Vettel when the German ran wide. Then Rosberg attacked. It was a fine move, with the titanium underbellies of both cars sparkling in the dark. Rosberg held Vettel off and powered through. He was now running second behind Hamilton, who was in clear command. Next came the opening round of pit stops. Vettel was first in of the front-runners. Rosberg was in next but emerged from the pits behind the man he had just sweated blood passing. Hamilton was soon in but a slow wheel change delayed him — a mistake for which the team apologised over the radio — as Vettel and Rosberg were now flying around. Suddenly, Hamilton’s gap had narrowed to under a second from more than five seconds . Hamilton leads the pack on the run down to Turn 1 ahead of Vettel and Rosberg as sparks fly in Bahrain . Hamilton leads the field round on the pardare lap in Bahrain, the fourth round of the championship . Hamilton is now 27 points clear of Mercedes team-mate Rosberg as he bids to win his third championship . Rosberg immediately passed Vettel again with another close-your-eyes, hold-on-to-your-hats move. Could Rosberg conjure something special and catch Hamilton? No. If the opportunity was ever there, it did not last long. Hamilton was away, Rosberg’s hopes of victory evaporating in an instant. The next round of stops came along. Vettel was again first in; Rosberg was next, only to come out behind Vettel again; Rosberg then passed Vettel once more when the Ferrari ran wide. But up front now, having stopped only once, was Raikkonen on a different tyre strategy. He would stay out longer before putting in a final burst on the faster soft tyres. Raikkonen was left with about 20 seconds to make up in 17 laps. His deficit was 16.2sec with 15 laps remaining. He was now three seconds quicker than the Mercedes and on course. He continued to eat into those in front of him — Hamilton and Rosberg (who finally got his place from a sometimes erratic Vettel when the Ferrari car needed a new nose). Raikkonen could not catch Hamilton, but Rosberg, suffering brake problems, ran wide and the Ferrari went through for second. Watching from the McLaren hospitality area was Jenson Button. His car, which broke down in qualifying, did not recover from its electrical gremlins to allow him to race. It was only the third race of the last 272 staged the Briton has missed. He tweeted his thoughts from his chair in the paddock, as his countryman shone brighter than all the stars.

Mark O'Meara celebrates his winning putt in 1998 . 20 Mark O'Meara, 1998 . Aged 41, Mark O'Meara's chances of a major championship appeared to have gone despite a fine career and many victories on the PGA Tour. But O'Meara shot two birdies in three holes from the 15th on Sunday and a good approach into the 18th left him with a 20-footer to beat David Duval and Fred Couples. In the manner of his great friend Tiger Woods, he drained it. And he was soon handed his green jacket by Woods in the Butler Cabin. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO . 19 Billy Joe Patton, 1954 . Billy Joe Patton came within a stroke of perhaps the biggest Masters shock of all but narrowly missed out on a play-off with Sam Snead and Ben Hogan. But for a short while it had appeared that an amateur golfer could topple two of the greatest ever to play the game, thanks to his hole-in-one on the par-three sixth on Sunday. Sadly, Patton's hopes were ultimately shot down by a double bogey on the 13th attempting to fly Rae's Creek and reach the green in two. Otherwise his ace would have featured near the very top of this list. Billy Joe Patton hits on the 13th hole... the scene of the double-bogey which ultimately cost him victory . CLICK HERE for the second part of our countdown, featuring videos of shots from the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Bubba Watson and Tiger Woods... 18 Seve Ballesteros, 1983 . Seve's second Masters victory featured what he called 'the best golf of my life' over the first four holes, and one 205-yard 2-iron on the fourth was utterly spectacular. But nothing quite sums up the genius of the late, great Spaniard than the way he clinched his four-shot victory over Tom Kite and Ben Crenshaw. An up and down for a bogey would have comfortably sewn up his victory, but showman Seve was having none of it and chipped in for a par four. 17 Byron Nelson, 1937 . Byron Nelson found himself a somewhat daunting six shots behind Ralph Guldahl in the final round of the 1937 tournament. But his comeback was complete on the par-five 13th after he found the cup with a chip for eagle from off the green, while his rival could only manage bogey. Lord Byron came from four strokes down to two ahead in just 25 minutes, and went on to win the first of his five majors by that same margin.

The big Fijian won the green jacket in 2000 but may not have hit a finer shot than this one during the annual par-three tournament on the Wednesday before the 2009 edition. Vijay skimmed his ball across a lake and watched as it rolled onto the green and into the cup for an ace. You'll need to see it to believe it. 15 Nick Faldo, 1989 . With dark descending, in dank drizzle and with wind whipping the course, Nick Faldo became only the second Briton ever to win the Masters after a play-off with Scott Hoch. His nerveless approach over the water on the 11th hole was good, but the putt was even better. Faldo recalled how his caddie, Andy Prodger, told him it was too dark to see the line of the shot, but he stroked it pure and right into the heart of the cup. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE SHOT . Nick Faldo celebrates his brilliant putt to win the Masters in a play-off in 1989 . 14 Charl Schwartzel, 2011 . Charl Schwartzel's victory three years ago is most famous for his rip-roaring finish - four birdies in the final four holes sealed his first major title - but his start was no less incredible. After missing the first green, the South African somehow chipped in from 100 feet for a remarkable birdie. And then, on the third, he slam-dunked his approach from the fairway for an eagle two. Two incredible shots, but the gods truly were smiling on Schwartzel that day. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO . Charl Schwartzel (right) is presented with his green jacket by Phil Mickelson in 2011 . 13 Phil Mickelson, 2004 . Phil Mickelson had long carried the burden of being known as 'the best player never to have won a major' - just ask Lee Westwood how wearisome that feels. Lefty had a string of near-misses behind him - six second and third places - when he went toe-to-toe with Ernie Els over the back nine at Augusta that Sunday. And it all came down to the final green as Phil the Thrill sank an 18-footer for birdie under huge pressure to cast off that unwanted reputation once and for all. 12 Fuzzy Zoeller, 1979 . Imagine playing in your very first Masters... and standing over a putt to win, in a sudden-death play-off. It was the first time the Masters had been decided in such a way, was played in the gathering gloom and also included Ed Sneed and the great Tom Watson. In near darkness, Zoeller held his nerve to sink his birdie putt on the 11th hole and make history. 11 Louis Oosthuizen, 2012 . Some might argue that this is the best shot in Masters history - but some would also say it wasn't even the best shot of the day (see the countdown from 10-1). Whatever, it's hard to think of a more perfectly envisioned, controlled and executed long iron in the history of the game. Oosthuizen catapulted himself into the lead (and an eventual play-off) with this 253-yard approach into the par-five second hole that pitched on a sixpence at the front of the green. From then on, it was never going anywhere other than the centre of the cup. Louis Oosthuizen raises his arms and soaks it all in after holing out for an albatross at Augusta in 2012 .","The 79th Masters Tournament begins on Thursday at Augusta National .

"1. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 68 . 2. Sebastian Vettel (Ferrari) 55 . 3. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) 51 . Nico Rosberg was brooding, his face stony, his eyes fixed on the middle distance and his fingers intermittently clapping in anger. He was sitting next to Lewis Hamilton — as close as the German had got to his Mercedes team-mate all afternoon of the Chinese Grand Prix — at a post-race press conference fizzing with recriminations. Rosberg, whose usual coiffured, Euro-chic sheen had vanished, alleged that Hamilton had selfishly tried to spoil his race. The record states that Hamilton won, Rosberg was second and Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel third. But Rosberg feared he might be overtaken by Vettel before the second round of pit stops when Hamilton, then leading from pole position, slowed down a few fractions of a second — to conserve his tyres, he said. Lewis Hamilton is now 13 points clear in the race for the drivers' championship after winning the Chinese Grand Prix .

Rosberg asked the team to get Hamilton to speed up, an instruction they issued and one with which the Briton complied. ‘I wasn’t controlling his race; I was controlling my own race,’ said Hamilton, indignantly. ‘I had no real threat from Nico.’ But Rosberg said: ‘It’s interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace. That opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try that early pit-stop to try and jump me.’ Hamilton countered: ‘My job is to manage the car and bring the car home as fast as possible and that’s what I did. I didn’t do anything intentionally to slow the cars up.’ Boys, boys. It took a little longer last season for the old karting friends to sling so much mud in public. We are only three races into a 19-round saga and the brickbats and mutual suspicions are already tumbling out. It was easy to sympathise with Rosberg but difficult to agree with him. Even though he was somewhat stronger here than during the opening two race weekends, he must be reaching his wits’ end, frustrated to distraction, wondering how on earth he can possibly beat Hamilton when he is on form. It seems, to this cod psychologist, that it was Rosberg’s deep exasperation that led him to behave as he did. Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, came to his not guilty verdict immediately after the race. ‘We have first and second,’ said the three-time world champion.

Hamilton is covered in champagne by Rosberg as the Mercedes pair celebrate a one-two finish . ‘I don’t care if there is a quarrel, as long as Vettel is only third. One thing is clear: Lewis had pole and controlled the race from beginning to the end. There’s nothing more to say. True, Lewis will drive selfishly. These guys are egocentric b******s. It is the only way to win the championship, and Nico is the same if the s*** hits the fan. Lewis was better this weekend. ‘There is no friendship out there. When you race you have to fight, that’s it.’ For Hamilton it was a fourth victory at this extravagant confection of a track, the circuit where he suffered one of the blackest moments of his rookie season, ending up in a gravel trap, his championship hopes devastated in 2007. He again finished the race at a relatively low speed as marshals failed to clear Max Verstappen’s crippled Toro Rosso. The safety car came out. Anti-climax though it was, a giant roar erupted from the 29,000-strong main grandstand as the chequered flag was waved for Hamilton. He was congratulated over the radio for having ‘the full house’: pole, fastest lap and race win. It was a flawless performance. The race posed many tantalising questions. The first was whether Ferrari could match Mercedes in the temperate Shanghai climate, as they managed in Malaysia a fortnight ago? They were some way off in the end but clearly close enough to spook Rosberg. They will keep Mercedes on their toes, and that is balm for the sport. Hamilton takes great pleasure in spraying champagne over a grid girl as he celebrates his victory at the Shanghai International Circuit . Rosberg appeared glum on the podium after losing out to team-mate Hamilton at the third consecutive race . Hamilton, who has provided emphatic answers to every question asked of him since taking last year’s title, made the perfect start. He inclined his car right on the grid, covering Rosberg next to him, before darting through the first, right-hand corner in front. Contest over before it started. An honourable mention for 17-year-old Verstappen, who drove his Toro Rosso with great elan. He put his car down the inside of Marcus Ericsson’s Sauber, causing Max’s father and former racer Jos to exhale in relief as he watched the dangerous move from the garage. He then applauded in admiration. Alas, Verstappen’s engine gave up on him and he left his machine parked on the start-finish straight. Red Bull’s woes continued with Daniil Kvyat’s Renault engine billowing grey smoke into the Shanghai air. Their other car, driven by Daniel Ricciardo, was ninth. McLaren were even less successful than Red Bull, again. Jenson Button was demoted a place to 14th, having collided with Pastor Maldonado’s Lotus. Button’s team-mate Fernando Alonso was 12th after being lapped by Vettel, his replacement at Ferrari. Vettel was smiling afterwards, but not as widely as Hamilton. Max Verstappen starred once more following a number of thrilling passes, but he failed to make it to the end of the race after his engine expired . Jenson Button, who finished 13th, was involved in a collision with Pastor Maldonado towards the end of the race .","Lewis Hamilton led every lap after clinching pole position to seal his second victory of the campaign .

"England's dressing-room brains trust will take on an extra dimension if Zafar Ansari, the Surrey spin-bowling all-rounder, makes his international debut against Ireland in Malahide on May 8. The 23-year-old Ansari, who celebrated his call-up with four Essex wickets at The Kia Oval, graduated from Cambridge two years ago with a double first in politics and sociology. He is halfway through a 40,000-word masters on the 1960s civil rights movement in the American south, and plays the piano to a high level. It's fair to say he would be England's most academically gifted cricketer since Ed Smith – another Cambridge double first – won three Test caps in 2003. Surrey's Zafar Ansarihas been called up to England's ODI squad for the clash against Ireland . The left-handed batsman and left-arm spinner also has an eye on a career in academia one day . 'I think my Surrey team-mates enjoy having someone to talk to about things they don't think about or talk about necessarily,' Ansari told Sportsmail. 'I try to use the studies to avoid taking cricket too seriously. I think cricket is a sport, and isn't that important in the grand scheme of things. My studies and cricket are tools for each other, and I do try to see them in those instrumental ways.' Ansari, part of a young England squad picked with the 2019 World Cup in mind, opens in four-day cricket for his county, but bats in the middle order in limited-overs matches, bowls accurate left-arm spin and is an athletic fielder. England almost chose him for the Test tour of the Caribbean. James Taylor will captain England against Ireland . 'Playing in Dublin would be nerve-wracking because of the exposure,' he said. 'But when it comes to one-day cricket, I feel the gap between international and county cricket maybe isn't as big as between Test cricket and the second division.' Ansari's rise was accelerated by his five-wicket haul for Cambridge MCCU against Surrey back in 2011, when he removed Kevin Pietersen for 30 and helped the students to a 10-wicket win. Pietersen, now a county team-mate, was going through a difficult patch against left-arm spinners, but Ansari insists the pair have not spoken about the dismissal. 'It's never come up,' he said. 'I don't know if it was a touchy issue for him at the time, but it was a touchy issue in general. Anyone could have got him out – it just happened to be me.' Ansari spent three weeks in Sri Lanka over the winter with England Performance Programme, where he talked about the art of left-handed batting with Adam Lyth and Gary Ballance, and life as a spin bowler with Stephen Parry, Adil Rashid and Adam Riley. He is juggling his time between playing for Surrey and writing up his dissertation at London's Royal Holloway. He doesn't rule out a PhD or a career in academia. If so, he would follow the path of his father, Khizar, who hails from Lahore in Pakistan, settled in England in his teens because his own father was an engineer in the British Army, and was awarded an OBE 13 years ago for his work on race relations. Zafar's English mother is a historian. Between now and May 8, the dissertation may have to wait its turn. 'I'd love to give it a go with England,' he said. 'Things can happen quickly. A couple of good performances and it starts to snowball.' Lewis Gregory . A promising seam bowler who can bat a bit, the 22-year-old Gregory emerged through the ranks of Devon cricket before joining Somerset. Took 43 Championship wickets last season at an average of 26. Has also captained England Under 19s. David Willey . Northamptonshire's seam-bowling all-rounder was man of the match in the final of the 2013 domestic Twenty20 tournament. Son of former England all-rounder Peter, he celebrated his call-up with a typically hard-hitting fifty against Leicestershire. He's a left-armer too, which is all the rage after the World Cup. His county captain Alex Wakely reckons he's 'the Northants Botham'. Sam Billings . An explosive keeper-batsman at Kent, the 23-year-old Billings thrashed 458 runs in last season's Royal London One-Day Cup at an average of 114 and a strike-rate of 154. Made England's provisional 30-man World Cup squad when Craig Kieswetter withdrew because of an eye injury.","England have called up Zafar Ansari to their squad for ODI against Ireland .

"Former Arsenal flop Nicklas Bendtner was not included in the Wolfsburg squad for Sunday's draw against Schalke as punishment for turning up late for training on Friday. The Denmark international was due to start the match but ended up being dropped from the entire squad after his poor timekeeping landed him in hot water with manager Dieter Hecking. The Wolfsburg boss probably didn't need an invitation to lose his temper after watching his side crumble to a 4-1 home defeat by Napoli in the Europa League on Thursday and was obviously angered when Bendtner rolled up late the next day. Nicklas Bendtner was dropped from the Wolfsburg squad for Sunday's game after arriving late for training . Manager Dieter Hecking said that Bendtner would have started the match if he hadn't turned up late . 'Nicklas was going to play from the beginning but our training session was clearly earlier than he thought,' said boss Hecking. Sporting director Klaus Allofs added: 'There are a lot of ways of finding out when training is. And it is not as if there is that much traffic in Wolfsburg.' Hecking, speaking to Danish newspaper BT, said: 'As a team we have some rules that everyone should keep. When you break those rules you have to take the consequences. But we have spoken to Nicklas and everything is OK again.' Bendtner responded to the decision to drop him on Instagram on Sunday. He wrote: 'Stay strong and look forward. Mistakes can be made, but you got to deal with it and keep progressing.' The 27-year-old has only scored once in 16 league appearances this season since his arrival in Germany last summer. Bendtner has only netted once in the Bundesliga since joining Wolfsburg last summer .","Wolfsburg drew 1-1 with Schalke in the Bundesliga on Sunday .

"It started out as a sweet family moment on a day trip to the zoo: a little girl beating her chest at a gorilla, safely separated by a pane of glass. But it seems the Silverback at the Nebraska zoo was less amused. The massive animal - who had been standing at the back of the enclosure - clearly decides enough is enough, and runs at the onlookers. Playful: The little girl can be seen in the window beating her chest at one of the gorillas . Cross: But the gorilla's friend in the background isn't quiet as keen on the game . Sprint: And he decided the time had come to do something about it - so started running towards the glass . Heavy: The gorilla throws his entire weight at the pane of glass at Omaha's Henry Doorley Zoo . The gorilla then launches himself, and his hundreds of pounds, at the little girl, hitting the glass with such force it cracks. The terrified family have fled to safety in the meantime. The incident took place at Omaha's Henry Doorley Zoo yesterday, and since it was uploaded to YouTube  it has had more than 126,000 views. Writing on Reddit, the person who uploaded the video revealed: 'The person added: 'Shortly before this we were telling the kids they could not break it. They will never believe us again. 'Sadly the one beating her chest really started crying.' They added: 'I came back a couple of minutes later, and the zoo keepers were telling people to stay away.' Horror: The family's terrified reactions were captured in the glass the moment they gorilla hit . Impact: The force is so much the glass cracks on impact - sending the family fleeing . Huge: Mountain gorillas like this one can weigh as muhc as 485lb, or 220kg . Male mountain gorillas, which can reach the age of 40, weigh between 300 and 485lb (220kg). They are classified as an endangered species, and Henry Doorley Zoo is famous for its gorilla breeding programme. The zoo was responsible for the first gorilla test tube baby in 1995, and now boasts the largest gorilla sperm bank in the world.","Toddler filmed beating her chest at the Silverback at a Nebraska zoo .

"Bournemouth are set to hold off on expanding the capacity of their 12,000-seater Goldsands Stadium - as a tactic to help them next season. The away contingent are currently crammed into a corner of the ground between the South Stand and the East Stand. Manager Eddie Howe prefers the away fans not to be behind one of the goals to give his players a psychological advantage when they are playing in front of a home crowd. Bournemouth will not look to increase the capacity of their 12,000-seater Goldsands Stadium . Premier League rules state clubs must give the away fans 10 per cent of their overall allocation . Bournemouth officials are considering doubling the South Stand from its current 2,500 seats to 5,000, taking the whole capacity to just less than 15,000. However, Premier League regulations state that clubs must provide at least 10 per cent of their overall allocation of tickets for away supporters. This would mean that, should Bournemouth press ahead with the expansion, away fans might then have to be positioned behind one of the goals - against Howe’s wishes. Last year, the possibility of increasing the stadium to 18,000 by filling in all four corners was discussed, but the logistics of that make it unlikely. Just to expand the South Stand would cost the club £1.8million and, over the course of a season, they would only accrue £900,000 in ticket sales. Any construction would, therefore, be for the benefit of fans as opposed to any financial advantage. Manager Eddie Howe is reluctant to change the position of the away fans to behind the goal . With a capacity of 12,000 Bournemouth look set to have the smallest ground in the Premier League . The club will have to install undersoil heating during the summer to adhere to Premier League rules, something which was not a requirement in the Championship. The press box, which at present separates home and away fans in the East Stand, will also move to the opposite side of the pitch to be closer to the dugouts. Stewards or netting would be put between supporters from either side to keep them apart during matches. Bournemouth only had the South Stand built when they won promotion to the Championship in 2013, such has been their rapid rise up the football pyramid.","Manager Eddie Howe does not like having away fans behind the goal .

"Raheem Sterling was told in no uncertain terms by Liverpool supporters that they expect him to remain at the club this summer on the day he was parading the club's new home kit at Anfield. The new gingham design, presented to supporters at Anfield on Friday, is the first offering from US sports brand New Balance, who struck a record-breaking £300million four-year kit deal to replace sister company Warrior as Liverpool's suppliers.

Only a week ago, Sterling held nothing back with his stunning interview after rejecting a new £100,000-a-week deal at Liverpool. He also sensationally revealed that he was flattered to be linked with Arsenal to cast a huge question mark over his future. But Liverpool are adamant that the 20-year-old, who has two years left to run on his contract, will not be quitting this summer and are putting their shirt on him to stay. One fan shouted 'make sure we see you in that next season' at Sterling , and the heckle was greeted with applause. Sterling told an expectant audience: 'The fans are great. It's a massive boost when you come out of the changing room and hear them sing that song. You can't get better than that. While players also turned their attention to the FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley next weekend. 'It's special to play at Wembley, especially because it's my home town,' Sterling said. And Sturridge added: 'Winning the FA Cup would be huge for everyone - players, fans and staff. We all want to have some success and we hope it's this season. Winning the Cup could be a platform for more success in the future. 'It's great to play in front of these fans. It's an unbelievable feeling. It's a cliche but it's true, they are our 12th man. every week we try to get 3 points for the fans. they mean a lot to us.

"Liverpool have become the first Premier League club to release their new kit to be used for the 2015-16 campaign, with New Balance taking over in supplying the Merseyside club. It ends three seasons of the Reds having their kit manufactured by Warrior where, despite a string of smart home strips, away kits ranged from the bright to the bizarre. So as Reds fans give verdict on the new Liverpool kit, Sportsmail picks out its five favourites from over the years. Of course there are many to choose from so let us know your favourite  strips from the Merseyside club in the comments section at the bottom. Liverpool stars unveiled the club's new kit to fans at Anfield on Friday with New Balance supplying the strip . HOME KIT (1983-1985) Liverpool's golden age in the 1980s meant we could have picked from a number of kits but the strip worn against Roma in the 1984 European Cup final win gets our vote for its iconic status .

HOME KIT (1995-1996) A 1996 title fight just wasn't quite in reach for Liverpool in the end, but their adidas strip from that year has found its place in history after being involved in of the Premier League's greatest ever games in the 4-3 win over Newcastle. Or as TV commentator Martin Tyler might say: 'Barnes, Rush, Barnes, still John Barnes, Collymore closing in!'

Liverpool's Neil Ruddock (left) makes a challenge on Newcastle United's Faustino Asprilla as Jamie Redknapp jumps in to help his Reds team-mate during a 1996 Premier League clash . AWAY KIT (2000-2001) It was the year Liverpool were up for the cup...three of them in fact. Sure enough Liverpool looked smart on all fronts in their yellow strip when they came from behind to defeat Arsenal in the 2001 FA Cup final, with the season also seeing the Reds win the League Cup and UEFA Cup.

Owen (10) celebrates scoring the winning goal in the final along with Emile Heskey (left), Gerrard and Fowler . HOME KIT (2004-2005) A winning kit is always memorable, and there won't be many Liverpool triumphs more memorable than the 2005 Champions League final, where Steven Gerrard inspired the Reds to a famous win over AC Milan in Istanbul. A good day for the Reds... and kit manufactures Reebok. Steven Gerrard and Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez lift the trophy after winning the 2005 Champions League .

Carragher (left-to-right), Luis Garcia, Hyypia, Riise, Gerrard, Djibril Cisse and Xabi Alonso celebrate the win . AWAY KIT (2008-2009) For the first time in a long time Liverpool liked they could win their first Premier League title during 2008-09 but although their challenge melted away, they did record a stunning 4-1 win at eventual champions Manchester United wearing a grey kit inspired from the late 1980s. Rolling back the years... Fernando Torres shrugs off the attention of Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidic before equalising for Liverpool at Old Trafford in a March 2009 Premier League clash .

"Manchester United will have to wear Nike kit during their summer tour of the US, despite their world-record deal with adidas. The club are expected to jet across the Atlantic in July for a trip of around 12 days, which would have been an ideal opportunity to showcase their new gear following their £750m, 10-year agreement. However, their existing deal with Nike runs until the end of July and Sportsmail understands there is no buy-out agreement that would allow the club to exit the agreement early has been agreed.

Ryan Giggs is pictured in an adidas shirt, the Barclays Premier League side last wore adidas shirts in 1992 . That means that unless United remain in America until August 1 - a week before the start of the season - fans will have to wait to see the new kit while their team continues in what will effectively be an old ensemble. As reported on Wednesday, the tour will be shorter than last year's epic trek across the country and is likely to be confined to the west coast thanks to input from manager Louis van Gaal. The Dutchman, who pays ferocious attention to detail, vowed that a repeat of last summer would not happen again on his watch and believes to this day that the effects of the pre-season schedule cost his side dearly when the real action started. Louis van Gaal has had a big input on United's pre-season plans, restricting the US tour to just 12 days .

"West Ham have announced a new five-year multi-million pound kit deal with Umbro. The Hammers join fellow Barclays Premier League sides Everton and Hull in partnering with the former England kit makers. Umbro produced the first-ever West Ham replica kits for sale in the 1960s when the likes of World Cup winners Bobby Moore, Sir Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters famously wore the claret and blue in their 1964 FA Cup and 1965 European Cup Winners' Cup triumphs. West Ham have announced a five-year deal with Umbro to supply their kits starting next season . West Ham last wore an Umbro strip between 2007 and 2010 but have a long affiliation with the brand . Umbro supplied the kit for the great West Ham team of the sixties, featuring the likes of Geoff Hurst (left), Bobby Moore (middle) and Martin Peters . Hammers vice-chairman Karren Brady hopes the revived partnership will herald similar success on the field as they enter the final season at Upton Park before the club's exciting move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016. 'As we approach two historic seasons for West Ham United, we are delighted once again to team up with Umbro, a company which – like West Ham – is steeped in the heritage of English football but also a fast-growing global brand with an exciting future ahead,' said Brady. 'It is especially fitting that – during our final season at the Boleyn Ground – our players and fans will wear a brand synonymous with one of the finest moments in West Ham’s rich history: England’s 1966 World Cup triumph. 'It is our determination to bring back those glory days of the 1960s when we move to our magnificent new Stadium, and we look forward to doing so in partnership with Umbro, whose commitment to the highest standards of excellence and quality matches our own.' The Hammers wore an Umbro kit when Bobby Moore lifted the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965 . England were dressed by Umbro when Bobby Moore lifted the World Cup in 1966 . West Ham will return to Umbro kits for their final season at Upton Park in 2015-16 . West Ham will move to the Olympic Stadium after next season . Umbro, who last endorsed the Hammers in 2010, will replace adidas as the east London outfit’s technical suppliers at the end of the season. And their first task is to design a commemorative kit for West Ham's final season at the Boleyn Ground, which will have the consultation of supporters. 'We know the last season at the Boleyn Ground will be an emotional one and we have worked closely with the club – with input from Hammers fans – to create a memorable set of kits to commemorate the final season,' said Umbro's vice president of global marketing, Paul Nugent. 'Our kit designs for West Ham are unique to the club and celebrate the rich traditions of the club whilst incorporating all the modern performance properties required for today’s game. 'We’re looking forward to sharing our 2015/16 kits and hope players and fans will be proud to wear them both home and away.'","West Ham have signed a new kit deal with Umbro starting next season .

"Newcastle supporters have been encouraged to stand up   in protest against Mike Ashley’s running of the club when they face Swansea at St James’ Park on Saturday. Fans group AshleyOut.com was behind last Sunday’s boycott of the 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs, which saw at least 10,000 supporters stay away as their side lost a sixth game on the spin. And now they are encouraging fans to ‘Stand Up To Ashley’ this weekend. Newcastle announced record profits of £18.7million earlier this month before revealing that a further £34m is sat in the bank. Newcastle United fans have planned a mass protest against owner Mike Ashley on Saturday afternoon . At least 10,000 supporters stayed away from St James' Park for the club's last home game against Spurs . Fans are unhappy at the club's lack of ambition, despite owner Ashley having £34million in the bank . Fans are upset and alarmed at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition which has left them with a threadbare squad in danger of relegation. A statement from AshleyOut.com read: ‘For those fans wishing to attend the Swansea game, we request them to #StandUpToAshley after 34 minutes of the game, to represent the fact that having no manager and a threadbare squad devoid of quality, yet having £34m in the bank is not an acceptable situation.’ They added: ‘We have seen a vast increase of awareness for Mike Ashley’s failed ownership of Newcastle United in the local and national media and amongst fans who were previously resigned to apathy. ‘These fans have now hopefully found a vehicle to express their profound dissatisfaction with the situation the club finds itself in, which is essentially one of a proud sporting institution transformed into a giant advertising vehicle.’ And the protest – which is backed by the respected Newcastle United Supporters Trust – also plans to target Ashley’s Sports Direct stores. The statement continued: ‘Secondly, from 12:30pm on Saturday we will target Sports Direct stores within a 20-mile radius of St. James’ Park and their flagship Oxford Street store by means of a peaceful protest. The supporters' group have asked fans to stand in the 34th minute of Saturday's  match against Swansea . Fans boycotting the Spurs match hold banners demanding the resignation of Ashley as Newcastle director . Newcastle supporters have also been asked to take part in peaceful protests outside Sports Direct stores . ‘Further details regarding this protest will be released shortly but we wish to emphasise that this must be a peaceful protest and is aimed at Mike Ashley and the shareholders of Sports Direct International plc. ‘This protest is not aimed at the innocent staff members often working with minimal employment rights on zero hours contracts and they must be respected and supported at all times. ‘This protest will be coordinated with supporters of Rangers Football Club who will target stores in the vicinity of Ibrox.’","Newcastle face Swansea at St James' Park on Saturday afternoon .

"For many people there is nothing worse than wasting food, especially when it comes to that half eaten loaf of bread. But now Bon Apetit has come up with a genius way to revive your stale loaf and it involves running it under the tap. And whilst it might sound like an unusual move, they promise that this trick will revive your crusty old bread before dinner time. Bon Apetit have revealed that the best way to revive a stale loaf of bread is to run it under water before baking it in the oven . The first step they suggest is to take your stale bread and run it under your tap. It doesn't matter if the water is hot or cold but you should try to keep the cut edge away from the direct flow of water. Then turn your oven on to a warm temperature - around 150 degrees - and stick the bread inside. For a small loaf you need to allow around 6-7 minutes and for a large, or particularly wet one, around 12 to 13 minutes. The experts say it works because: 'The water turns to steam, which rehydrates the bread’s crumb, or interior, while the heat of the oven firms up the crust.' When you have wet your bread put it in the oven for between 6 and 13 minutes depending on how large and how wet the loaf is . Femail spoke to Lifesum nutritionist Luvisa Nilsson who said that the water trick does actually work, but you must make sure to eat the bread that same day. 'Whilst there might not be any obvious health risks whilst using the water/heat method, it is beneficial not to waste food,' she said.' 'Once you have put your ‘watered’ bread in the oven or microwave, make sure you eat it within the day, as the warmth and damp may potentially harbour bacteria. Nutritionist Luvisa Nillson says that you should be careful to check that your bread is not mouldy and make sure to eat it within one day . She continued: 'There is however a difference between stale and mouldy bread, and you must watch out for mould. 'Bread should be disposed off if it has orange, green, yellow or black spots as these can be harmful to your gut and cause severe discomfort and stomach ache. 'When bread goes stale it is usually a good sign that It is about to go mouldy, so give the bread a thorough check before consuming.'","Bon Apetit have revealed the best way to revive a stale loaf of bread .

"Manchester United have confirmed their plans to revisit the USA on pre-season this summer after agreeing to Louis van Gaal’s desire to head to America rather than Asia. United’s shirt sponsors Chevrolet are keen for the club to visit the Far East as the American car giant seeks to expand its business in that part of the world and were enthusiastic about that trip taking place this summer. However, after months of discussions between the United board and manager Van Gaal the club will once again head across the Atlantic for a four-game tour signed off by the manager. Manchester United's pre-season tour of the United States will see them play Louis van Gaal's ex-club Barca . The pre-season plans have been organised to Van Gaal's liking after he was unhappy last year in USA . The Premier League giants will face Club America, San Jose Earthquakes, Barcelona and PSG . United will play once again in the International Champions’ Cup, the tournament they won in America last summer. This time, though, with Van Gaal’s influence over all matters of club business growing ever stronger, the club will squeeze four games in to 12 days before heading back to England on July 30 in order to recover in time for the start of the Barclays Premier League season on August 8. July 17 - vs Club America . CenturyLink Field, Seattle - 72,000 capacity . July 21 - vs San Jose Earthquakes . TBC . July 25 - vs Barcelona . Levi's Stadium, California - 68,500 capacity . July 29 - vs Paris Saint-Germain . Soldier Field, Chicago - 61,500 capacity . Van Gaal was furious last summer with the amount of travelling United had to do as they zig-zagged around America, playing games in Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and Miami. This time, United will be based largely on the west coast, playing games against Club America in Seattle, San Jose Earthquakes, at a venue to be announced and Barcelona near San Francisco before facing PSG in Chicago on the way home. As revealed earlier this month in Sportsmail, the tournament organisers have essentially organised this summer’s tournament around United’s needs. For example, there will be no final this year in order to avoid last summer’s rather delicate situation that saw an irritated Van Gaal having to take his team to Miami for four days for a game he really had no desire to play. It is understood that United will use Seattle as their base before their first game this summer. Next summer’s tour, meanwhile, will almost certainly be to Asia, a continent United haven’t visited since David Moyes’ pre-season of 2013.

"There would have been no mercy in the dressing room. Nothing is sacred in the team. When Ben Stokes first turned up at the Kensington Oval this week someone would have said: ‘Mind that locker, Stokesey.’ It was here, of course, that Stokes broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed last year and that will be a reminder to him of the need to channel his aggression in the right way now he is back in the England team. Ben Stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the England cricket team . Stokes (left) clashed with Marlon Samuels during the second Test between West Indies and England . But Stokes (right) responded positively to the row after talking to England coach Peter Moores . Only a slight niggle in his back might stop Stokes playing here in Barbados and I am glad he has fought his way back after what has been a year of ups and downs. I like Stokes and I like his character at a time when the game can be perceived as producing robots and players who cannot capture the imagination. He has something about him, as he showed when he was in Mitchell Johnson’s face during the Ashes series. He was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return. But I do believe he will need careful man-managing. Peter Moores, England’s coach, dragged him to one side after his clash with Marlon Samuels in the second Test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right. The way he approached the Jamaican after that third-day salute was spot on. England must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on. It will not always come off but we have to accept that there will be lows as well as highs with this lad. What Stokes must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon-holed. He can be feisty and fiery as long as it’s natural but his aggression has to be controlled. You want the character as long as the end product is runs and wickets. Stokes (second left) can use his aggression to bring runs and wickets to the England team . Stokes (left) congratulates England captain Alastair Cook after the side won the second Test . England want to have Stokes in the team as much as possible to help him hit his full potential . Let him go a bit but rein him in occasionally. There is an argument here to play the second spinner in Adil Rashid and if England went down that route in Bridgetown the place of Stokes or Chris Jordan would come into question but they clearly want both to play as much as possible. This summer there will rarely be the need for two spinners so England want these two exciting cricketers to grow into the international game. They can only get better and that’s an exciting prospect.","Ben Stokes returns to the ground where he broke his wrist hitting a locker .

"Chelsea will face Paris Saint-Germain, the French team who knocked Jose Mourinho’s side out of the Champions League this season, in a pre-season friendly in July. The Blues, who were sent crashing out on away goals at the last-16 stage following a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge, will play PSG in North Carolina on July 25.

"They are often an embarrassing topic that leaves many people unwilling to talk about them, let alone own up to having one. But analysis of popular search terms on Google has revealed the areas around the world that seem to be most concerned with sexually transmitted diseases. By far, the most searched for term globally is HIV and AIDS, followed by herpes and then Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) which can cause cervical cancer. The map above shows the countries in Europe with the highest and second highest number of searches per capita for different sexually transmitted diseases. The data was gathered using Google Trends . In the UK, chlamydia seemed to cause most concern, and is incidentally the most commonly diagnosed STD in the country according to official figures. However, in the US herpes was the most searched for term across the country, with Georgia being the state with the most searches for the virus. In Europe, Norway came out as what the maps called a 'herpes hotspot' generating the most searches per capita, followed by Montenegro. Russians seemed to be the most concerned about gonorrhea, while people in Finland were the biggest group searching for information about chlamydia. A study has discovered one in ten Americans think HTML - the name given to the code that makes up websites - is a sexually transmitted disease, while almost a third think a gigabyte is an insect. The research was carried out to determine how knowledgeable people are when it comes to tech terms, and how important they think tech is. Vouchercloud’s study asked 2,392 men and women aged over 18 to identify the meanings of a variety of words. These words were a mix of technical and non-technical terms, and each term was given with three multiple choice answers. Switzerland was the centre for the most searches about syphilis in Europe, while Croatians were the hotspot for HPV. Albania had the most searches for HIV/AIDS. In the US, Mississippi came out as the capital for gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia searches. While the data may reflect merely concern about the diseases, and so will in some cases highlight the most health conscious countries and states, it can also help to shed some light on where the incidence of STDs are highest. Mississippi has the highest rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea of all the 50 states in the US, for example. New York was found to be the hotspot for searches about HPV while the District of Columbia was the area that searched most for information about HIV/AIDS. It also has the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the country. Monitoring the spread of STDs is notoriously difficult due to the stigma that often surrounds them, which makes people reluctant to be tested or admit to infections. The analysis of STD web searches was conducted by Superdrug's Online Doctor service which offers medical support and advice over the internet. The map above shows the states where the highest and second highest number of searches for STDs . The data showed that most worldwide Google searches are about HIV/AIDs closely followed by herpes . Chlamydia and gential warts attracted the most searches in the UK in the past year, while in the US internet users seemed to be most concerned about herpes followed by chlamydia, as the graph above reveals . It said the searches seemed to reflect some of the underlying trends in the spread of STDs and treatment for them. For example, antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea has spread from east Asia to Europe over the past decade, which may explain why Russia shows the most searches for this condition. Switzerland has also seen an increase in syphilis cases since 2010, including congenital syphilis transmitted from mother to child. This graph and map shows the areas of the UK and US where herpes was searched for most, and how searches have changed in both countries over time. A spike in searches in both countries can be seen at the time when Harvard Medical School announced it had discovered potential new treatment for herpes in 2009 . The graph and map above show the hotspots in the US and the UK for searches about syphilis. It also shows that searches for the condition appear to be rising in both countries after falling slightly around 2009 . Many people may also be turning to the internet to find out information about STD's due to inadequate levels of support in the healthcare systems of their countries. In Albania, for example, which had the highest number of searches per capita for HIV/AIDS, just 2 per cent of healthcare clinics provide screening for HIV. Ukraine, which had the second highest number of searches for HIV, is suffering one of the worst AIDS epidemics in Europe. The research also examined searches for sexual dysfunction related terms and found that perhaps surprisingly, Italy came out as the capital for searches about the problem, along with premature ejaculation. Gonorrhea hotspots in the UK and US are shown in the map above while the graph also shows that searches for the term are increasing, although the data may be affected by searches for the name of a pop song by Lil Wayne released in September 2010 . Searches for HIV in the US and UK appear to be on the decline, although Oxford came out as the hotspot where in the UK where most people searched for information, while Leesburg came top in the US . Searches for information about chlamydia seem to be increasing dramatically in recent years. London and San Antonio come out as the cities where most people in the UK and US are searching about the diseease . West Virginia was the state with most searches about erectile dysfunction and Pennyslvania had the most searches for premature ejaculation. People in the UK and Germany both seemed to search most for Viagra, while in the US, Florida was the state with most searches for the drug. A spokesman for Superdrug's Online Doctor said: 'Sexual topics can be a difficult subject for anyone to discuss, especially when it comes to diseases and sexual dysfunctions. 'Yet behind this silence, the data show that these health issues are surprisingly common, and many people around the world are struggling with the discomfort and stigma of these conditions.' The research was carried out by Superdrug.","Analysis of Google search results has revealed the areas in Europe and the United States most concerned with different sexually transmitted diseases .

"Eight years ago, after his AC Milan team had beaten Liverpool to win the Champions League final in Athens, Kaka knelt in the centre circle, spread his arms out wide, tilted his head back and turned his eyes to the skies in a gesture of worship and supplication. The Brazilian superstar was wearing a vest on which he had printed the proud statement 'I Belong to Jesus'. It was a striking, bold image of a man not afraid to display his faith. Please correct me if I'm wrong but I can't remember anybody screaming that what Kaka had done was a 'disgrace'. I can't remember him being mocked or ridiculed. I can't remember anyone saying his gesture was an affront to public decency. Kaka showed off an 'I belong to Jesus' vest after AC Milan's Champions League win against Liverpool in 2007 . The Brazilian midfielder, who is deeply religious, was not mocked or ridiculed for the message on his clothes . I can't remember public anger being mobilised against him or him being held up as a symbol of a creeping, sinister malaise in our society. I can't remember Kaka being criticised for his faith. I can't remember anyone saying that such shows of religious devotion were out of place at a football match. Last Monday night, I went to an LA Dodgers game at Dodger Stadium. As always before a sporting event of any size in the States, professional or high school, the crowd sang the national anthem lustily. I might not have been paying attention but I don't recall anybody objecting when the spectators sang God Bless America. I don't recall anybody saying they were inflicting their religion on the non-Christians among the crowd. The idea that anybody might do that is absurd, right? I mean, amid all the other things we have to worry and fret about, who could object to something as harmless as that? And what about the high profile Bible Group that exists on golf's PGA Tour and boasts major winners such as Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson among its members? Some members pause midway through their rounds to read from the New Testament, meditate on holy scriptures and pray. 'We do something before every round,' American golfer Ben Crane said recently. Two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson is part of a Bible Group on the PGA Tour . Webb Simpson, pictured in action at the RBC heritage, is another well known Christian golfer . Nobody sees fit to complain about that, surely. Imagine the outrage if they did. Whether you follow the same beliefs or not, why would anybody object to sportsmen finding some common ground in religion? It's the same in the NFL. Players routinely congregate on the pitch before and after a match to pray. Not a big deal. Not even something to remark upon. Just part of players' rituals. Members of the Seattle Seahawks, who won the Super Bowl two years ago, even made a proselytising video extolling the virtues of Christianity and urging supporters to 'find out how you can get plugged in with local believers'. No problem, surely. And let's not forget our own Premier League. Some might see it as a refuge of the godless but many of its players don't agree. Daniel Sturridge, the Liverpool forward, talks openly about giving the glory for his deeds to God. His beliefs are widely seen as a positive element in his life. Javier Hernandez always dropped to his knees to pray before kick off when he played for Manchester United. David Luiz, the former Chelsea defender, used to drive to training with a 'Christ is Life' sticker on his van when he was at Benfica. Daniel Sturridge (left) and Javier Hernandez (right) both express their beliefs on the football pitch . So forgive me for being naive but why is it that when two men pray quietly in a small corner of an English football ground that their actions should be labelled a 'disgrace'. The only disgrace, of course, was the blinkered, bigoted reaction of the petty-minded oaf who took the picture of the men and was appalled by what he saw. What exactly is noteworthy about two men praying on the concourse at Anfield during Liverpool's FA Cup tie with Blackburn Rovers last month? Why is it that when another group of supporters did the same thing at a West Ham match recently, their actions were met with similar consternation? You probably remember the video footage of that incident at Upton Park. A breathless man shouting 'what is this' as he filmed the men praying as if they were engaged in an act of desecration. Then the supporters around him started yelling 'Irons, Irons' as if they had located a rival hooligan faction. Stephen Dodd took this photograph of Asif Bodi and Abubakar Bhula praying at Anfield last month . Let's be honest about this because there's a simple answer to the question of what unites these reactions: if you're Christian, it's OK to pray at a football ground. If you're Muslim, it's not. That's the truth, isn't it? That's what we're avoiding. Expressions of Christian devotion at sporting events go unremarked. Expressions of Muslim devotion are described as 'extraordinary scenes'. They prompt suggestions that this will be the thin end of the wedge and that soon, horror of horrors, there will be prayer rooms at football stadia. Er, well, what's wrong with that? Some clubs already have prayer rooms, actually. They're multi-denominational. It is bizarre that anyone should even consider it an issue. But they do, apparently. Religion at a sporting event becomes a topic only when it is someone else's religion. Bob Dylan sang about that once. The verse went like this: 'You don't count the dead when God's on your side.' Failure to end KP debate is hurting England . It's a sorry state of affairs when England's inability to close out the First Test against the West Indies is seen through the prism of another failure to quell speculation about the return of Kevin Pietersen. Victory would have quietened some of the voices that have been urging his restoration to the side. Defeat would have hastened his recall. The draw in Antigua was the worst of all worlds. Jonathan Trott leads the way as England's players trudge off after their draw against the West Indies . There is an unavoidable sense that English cricket will not be able to move on until the Pietersen issue is resolved and an inconclusive series in the Caribbean will mean only that our game is more likely to be left in a state of limbo until the Ashes series this summer and possibly beyond. It almost feels as if it would be better to throw Pietersen  into the fray and step back and watch the fisticuffs. There is a storm coming and until it breaks, we fret about the dark clouds. Talk of an England return for batsman Kevin Pietersen is continuing to gather pace . Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was convicted of first degree murder last week for shooting a man six times. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole. The jury heard that Hernandez, one of the best players in the NFL, thought that wealth and fame made him immune from the rule of law. His demise is a grim warning of the worst that can happen when the inflated wages modern sportsmen earn warp their minds. Former NLF star Aaron Hernandez (second from right) has been sentenced to life in prison without parole . Favourite food at a sporting venue? The Eccles cakes they used to serve at Anfield take some beating but the garlic fries they serve at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles went to the top of my list this week.

"If you are an aspiring manager in English football and you are black, you get used to one thing: when an opportunity comes your way, it’s going to be the managerial equivalent of a hospital pass. Sorry, but it’s true. With a few exceptions, you don’t get the better opportunities. You get the football version of mopping up the toilets. Chris Ramsey, the only black manager in the Premier League, is a classic example. Ramsey is a fine coach who has been overlooked for countless jobs. Chris Ramsey (right) and Kevin Hitchcock watch QPR hammer West Brom to keep their survival hopes alive . Ramsey takes nots during his side's biggest win of the season which gave their survival chances a boost . He took the QPR position after Harry Redknapp, a talented, experienced manager with a good track record of rescuing clubs in trouble, saw the writing on the wall and got out. Ramsey was asked to board the sinking ship and, guess what, it has not been an easy job to refloat it. Before the victory at West Brom, QPR were sliding deeper into trouble and there were already those seeking to blame it on Ramsey. Just as predictably, there were also those saying Ramsey’s struggles were an indication black managers tend to fail on the rare occasions they are given a chance. John Barnes' troubled reign at Celtic ended after an infamous Scottish Cup defeat by Inverness Caley Thistle . If Ramsey is sacked, people will say it was about results, not race. And they will be wrong. Because race was why he had to take the job in the first place. People tend not to like inconvenient truths about why there are so few black managers in the English game. Some got angry again when John Barnes suggested a manager on a bad run will get sacked sooner if he’s black. He was right. The fact Ramsey has been labouring to turn things around at QPR does not mean he is not a good manager.

"Mister Money is now putting his money where his mouth is. Floyd Mayweather has commissioned a mouthguard not only imbedded with his usual diamond and gold bling but stuffed with $100 bills. Total cost, according to his favourite website TMZ, is $25,000. Floyd Mayweather (left) vs Manny Pacquiao in the official advert for their mega-fight on May 2 . Pay-per-view watchers in America will have to pay up to $100 (£67.48) to watch the fight . Manny Pacquiao posted a picture of him doing yoga on Monday as part of his preparation for the big fight . Floyd Mayweather works in his gym as the fight with Pacquiao draws closer . As the value of the richest fight of all time keeps rising ever closer to the half-billion mark, so does the value of Manny Pacquiao’s target. If the PacMan does land the knockout blow, then given the expensive protection at least the Money Man should wake up smiling. Mayweather has just spent $300,000 on yet another vehicle, according to his favourite website TMZ. This is a Mercedes ‘Land Yacht’ people carrier to which he has added such extras as a 55-inch television and a champagne bar, to turn it into what he calls his ‘Party Bus.’ And so it turns out that all the time Andre Ward was talking about coming to England for a rematch with Carl Froch he was setting up yet another easy night out in his own backyard. Only a couple of days after the self-called Son of God declared he would be prepared to cross the Atlantic to face the Cobra, Ward revealed that his overdue ring comeback will be taking place in his California hometown on June 20. The opponent? Most likely a certain Marco Antonio Periban, who turned up in questionable condition to face James DeGale and was promptly knocked out in that final eliminator for Andre Dirrell’s IBF super-middleweight title. Andre Ward is set to make his overdue ring comeback in his hometown on June 20 . So much for wanting to do it a second time with Froch to unify the WBA’s two world championship belts. That fight had been ordered by the WBA and Froch’s promoter Eddie Hearn did his best to come to terms before the March 31 deadline . Now Ward’s announcement has made it yet more likely that Froch might retire. Ward had claimed a readiness to overcome his phobia – either fear of flying or of fighting abroad. He wouldn’t go as far as Froch’s home city of Nottingham but he did express a willingness to travel to London for a showdown at either Wembley or the 02. His argument was that his US victory over Froch in the final of the Super Six super-middleweight tournament took place in Atlantic City, not Oakland. So London would be fairer than Nottingham. Still, Froch doubted he was serious and was apparently right to do so. It is back to home sweet home for Ward, at the Oracle Arena across the bay from San Francisco. If not exactly the offspring of the Almighty, Ward is a favourite son of American boxing. So the WBA appear compliant, with no sign yet of him being stripped of his belt. Foch is unlikely to get his dream fight against Ward or Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr . Ward remains atop the ratings as their ‘super’ champion, with Froch still the ‘regular’ world titlist. Maybe the WBA are giving him license to shake off the ring rust after being out of the ring since his points win over another undistinguished foe, Edwin Rodriguez, way back in November 2013. Yet Ward’s inactivity has long since become more a result of self-inflicted promotional disputes than his original injury. Now he is the first major signing by the new kids on that block, the music industry-backed Roc Nation, who are trying to confirm not only the opponent for June 20 but a TV deal. That the television rights have not been snapped up instantly by either of the major networks HBO or Showtime speaks to Ward’s sluggish box office appeal despite the high professional regard for his skills. The closest he has come to properly fighting abroad has been a couple of low-key outings to the Caribbean. That he so much as contemplated travelling several thousand miles to face Froch indicates a realisation that he could make a lot more money in England. Still, that temptation is not enough. Not yet, anyway. He carries on talking about the Cobra later. But as it stands one of Froch’s dreams for his farewell appearance – boxing at the City Ground home of Nottingham Forest – has been dashed. The other ambition – a fight in Las Vegas – hangs on Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr coming through an interim bout and agreeing to meet him there in September. But Froch says: ‘Unless I get a fight that excites me soon I may well hang up the gloves.’ Ward, meanwhile, talks about meeting the challenge of middleweight KO sensation Gennady Golovkin ‘soon'. Floyd Mayweather says: ‘For me, Andre beats him every day of the week.' The questions, Andre, are which day? And where? The IBF still insist that Amir Khan, who has yet to confirm Chris Algieri or anyone else as his May 30 opponent, turned down a fight with Tim Bradley as a final eliminator for Kell Brook’s world welterweight title. One question for the IBF: . Why would Khan bother with an eliminator when Brook is gagging to meet him in a Battle of Britain? Amir Khan's proposed fight with Chris Algieri is yet to be confirmed .","Floyd Mayweather will have $25,000 mouthguard for Manny Pacquiao bout .

"She was the woman who inspired three of the greatest love songs of all time and was at the heart of the most famous love triangle in rock history. Married to both George Harrison and Eric Clapton, model Pattie Boyd was one of the most envied women in the world. Yesterday at the age of 71, she wed for a third time – with a soundtrack provided by her Irish terrier Freddie who did his best to upstage the bride and her new groom, property developer Rod Weston. Scroll down for video . Pattie Boyd has tied the knot for the third time, this time with Rod Weston at Chelsea Registry Office, Chelsea Old Town Hall, in London . Pattie, photographed with Rod and their dog Freddie, was famously married to both George Harrison and Eric Clapton in the past . The couple look delighted as their leave the town hall to a shower of confetti . The setting was very rock and roll; Chelsea Register Office on the King’s Road, where so many of pop’s leading men and women have married over the years. But that’s where any similarity with Pattie’s famous past began and ended. There were still splashes of style, of course, from the Bentley that took the happy couple to their wedding breakfast at the uber-trendy Beaumont Hotel in Mayfair to the presence of Pattie’s fellow Sixties model Edina Ronay. But there were no groupies or hangers-on as there had been when she married Clapton in 1979 or Harrison in 1966 – just a handful of close friends and family who threw confetti as Pattie and Rod, who have been together almost 25 years, emerged from the cream-painted Rossetti Room arm in arm. And in a nod to the tradition of the bride wearing something borrowed, Patti wore a hat owned by her late friend Pat Booth, the model turned best-selling author who died of cancer in 2009. Friends of the couple, who live in Kensington, feared they would never tie the knot. ‘It’s almost our silver anniversary so we thought we had better get on with it,’ said Weston, 61. George Harrison (who died in November 2001) and Pattie Boyd, 21, leave Epsom Registrar Office after their marriage in January 1966 . Eric Clapton married Pattie Boyd, the ex-wife of his friend George Harrison, in 1979 . Since settling down with Weston, Pattie, a former Vogue cover girl, has turned herself into an accomplished photographer and her pictures have been exhibited all over the world. With the death of John Lennon’s ex-wife Cynthia last month, convent-educated Pattie is now the sole surviving first wife of a Beatle. Born in Somerset, she met Harrison on the set of A Hard Day’s Night in 1964, when she was cast as a schoolgirl in The Beatles’ first film. They were married two years later when she was 21 and Harrison, 22. He later wrote the song Something for her. It was by no means the only famous song composed for the bewitching beauty. The 70-year-old model, photographer and author, has found love for the third time with Weston . Pattie showcased her age-defying good looks and sartorial prowess in a chic silver and blue coat jacket and silver dress . She accessorised her look with silver sandals and an oversized hat, and carried a posy of flowers as her guests showered her and her new husband with confetti . Eric Clapton, who pursued her passionately, rhapsodised about her refusal to abandon Harrison for him with his anguished and electrifying hit Layla. He also wrote his most famous ballad, Wonderful Tonight, for her. In her 2007 memoir, Wonderful Today, Pattie broke 35 years of silence to describe how after years of mutual anguish which pushed Clapton to the brink of a drug-induced breakdown, she eventually left Harrison to marry Clapton. Her affair with the guitarist started in 1970 after he played Layla to her for the first time. She said: ‘He played it to me two or three times, all the while watching my face intently for my reaction. My first thought was, “Oh God, everyone’s going to know this is about me.’’ Pattie, now 71, met property developer Rod back in 1991 and he became her long-term partner . Pattie with her mother and Diana and sister Jenny at her wedding on Thursday . Pattie, who has graced the cover of Vogue numerous times, and had three of arguably the greatest love songs ever written for her, has had some of the most high-profile relationships of all time . The first time that Pattie tied the knot was to George Harrison in January 1966 and legend Paul McCartney was best man . ‘I was married to Eric’s close friend George Harrison, but Eric had been making his desire for me clear for months. ‘But with the realisation that I had inspired such passion and creativity, the song got the better of me. I could resist no longer.’ Later that day, Clapton confronted Harrison and said: ‘I have to tell you, man, that I’m in love with your wife.’ They finally got together in 1974, marrying five years later. But while the songs have gone into rock history the marriage did not last and they split up in 1984. For Pattie, life these days is a lot less complicated and the bridge-playing former rock chick is happy to start a new chapter in her extraordinary life.","Pattie Boyd and Rod Weston, 61, have been together for almost 25 years .

"Imagine if Raheem Sterling had actually done something wrong. Imagine if he had not turned up for training. Imagine if he had refused to play. Imagine if he had gone on strike. Imagine, even, if he had asked for a transfer away from Liverpool. Imagine the opprobrium that would have been heaped upon him then. Because as it is, he has been labelled an ingrate and a fool. He has been called avaricious, capricious, disloyal and impressionable. He is in thrall, it is said, to a man portrayed as his Iago of an agent. Sterling’s ability has been questioned and his contribution to Liverpool has been mocked. His character has been traduced and scorn has been poured upon the notion that he will ever amount to anything. For what crime exactly? Well, to be honest, it’s hard to say. Raheem Sterling winces during Liverpool's 4-1 defeat at Arsenal to complete a tough week for the 20-year-old . Brendan Rodgers takes a deep breath as he watches his side succumb to their worst defeat of the season . Sterling is fouled by Hector Bellerin as Liverpool earn a penalty which was converted by Jordan Henderson . OK, so he has not signed the lucrative new contract that the club have put in front of him. Not yet, anyway. Given that he has more than two years left on his existing one, that is hardly a heinous act or a trigger for angst. He wants to wait to the end of the season, he says. So let him. He gave an interview to the BBC that he had not cleared with the club. Not particularly clever, admittedly. And, yes, the reference to being ‘flattered’ by Arsenal’s interest, particularly coming a couple of days before the clash between the two teams at the Emirates, was naïve. But the content of what he said was hardly incendiary. It amounted to a softly-spoken plea for time and space. Sterling is not the kind of person to shout the odds. Maybe he wants a little while to make up his mind. That’s not what Liverpool fans want to hear but it happens. It’s life. People consider their options. It’s their right. For what it’s worth, I hope Sterling stays at Anfield. I hope that sooner or later, he signs that new contract, or perhaps an improved version of it. At this stage of his career, leaving Liverpool is fraught with unnecessary risks. Liverpool are a great club and they are on the rise again. They are staffed by good, intelligent, forward-thinking football people. And I can’t think of any better manager than Brendan Rodgers under whom Sterling should continue the process of maturing into one of Europe’s best players. The 20-year-old gave an interview to the BBC on Wednesday, giving his opinion on a variety of matters . Brendan Rodgers called the interview 'a mistake' and shakes hands with his protege the day after its airing . Sterling's agent Aidy Ward is pictured sat next to Saido Berahino (centre) at Old Trafford . But none of that means I haven’t found the virulence of the reaction to Sterling’s refusal to sign immediately on the dotted line somewhat startling. The kid is only 20. Give him a break. This is, after all, an old storyline. We talk about loyalty in football as if it is a one-way street. We only apply it to footballers, not to clubs. Clubs generally have very little loyalty to players. They treat them as commodities. Or ‘expensive pieces of meat’, as Roy Keane would have it. And we don’t blink an eye. They pay the players well when they are worth something to them. They pay them to entertain their fans. And to sell season tickets. And to allow them to keep harvesting the vast amounts of Premier League television income flooding into their coffers. And to lift them into the Champions League, where they accrue even more cash. For the club owners, for the men who pay the wages, the relationship with a player is a business transaction. And when the player stops playing as well as he used to, when he loses his form or when he grows older and slower, or when they want to replace him with another player, they get rid of him. Rodgers remains confident that Sterling will stay and the situation will be resolved in the summer . It’s about money. It’s that way at Manchester United and at Manchester City. It’s that way at Arsenal and at Chelsea. And it’s that way at Liverpool, too. It’s the way it is and none of us question it. Not really. And yet we do not apply the same standards to players. We expect hard-headed business sense from the clubs but we demand that any nod to rationality is cast away when it comes to the time when players make decisions about their future. In its stead, we demand sentimental attachment from the players to override everything. We are terribly old-fashioned about it. The players should be grateful, we seem to be saying, because Jimmy Hill got the maximum wage abolished in 1961. There are a few, at least, who see the contradictions in that stance. ‘Raheem Sterling is fully entitled to make his own mind up,’ Gary Lineker wrote on Twitter. ‘Make choices that will prove to be right or wrong. It’s his life, his career.’ Lineker is right. I hope Sterling stays at Liverpool but if he asks for time to think before he commits himself, it is absurdly unjust that he should be pilloried for it. Black managers always get the worst jobs . If you are an aspiring manager in English football and you are black, you get used to one thing: when an opportunity comes your way, it’s going to be the managerial equivalent of a hospital pass. Sorry, but it’s true. With a few exceptions, you don’t get the better opportunities. You get the football version of mopping up the toilets. Chris Ramsey, the only black manager in the Premier League, is a classic example. Ramsey is a fine coach who has been overlooked for countless jobs. He took the QPR position after Harry Redknapp, a talented, experienced manager with a good track record of rescuing clubs in trouble, saw the writing on the wall and got out. Ramsey was asked to board the sinking ship and, guess what, it has not been an easy job to refloat it. Before the victory at West Brom, QPR were sliding deeper into trouble and there were already those seeking to blame it on Ramsey. Chris Ramsey (right) and Kevin Hitchcock watch QPR hammer West Brom to keep their survival hopes alive . John Barnes' troubled reign at Celtic ended after an infamous Scottish Cup defeat by Inverness Caley Thistle . Just as predictably, there were also those saying Ramsey’s struggles were an indication black managers tend to fail on the rare occasions they are given a chance. If Ramsey is sacked, people will say it was about results, not race. And they will be wrong. Because race was why he had to take the job in the first place. People tend not to like inconvenient truths about why there are so few black managers in the English game. Some got angry again when John Barnes suggested a manager on a bad run will get sacked sooner if he’s black. He was right. The fact Ramsey has been labouring to turn things around at QPR does not mean he is not a good manager. It just means that when your only chance in the game is to accept a hospital pass, the odds are you’re going to get hurt. It was my first visit to the Juventus Stadium on Tuesday and it was hard not to be impressed by the arena’s steep sides, excellent facilities, spectacular location and fine atmosphere. It was also hard not to notice that at a stadium with a capacity of just 41,000, there were 10,000 empty seats for a friendly against another major footballing nation. The Juventus Stadium is a magnificent venue, but fans stayed away from the midweek international friendly . A fan takes a selfie in the midst of a sea of empty seats in Turin with only 31,138 watching the game . England played to a crowd of 83,671 as they cruised past European lightweights Lithuania 4-0 at Wembley . A few days earlier, more than 83,000 fans had packed into Wembley for England’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania. English football might have plenty of problems but the loyalty of its supporters is not one of them.","He has not signed the lucrative contract Liverpool waved in front of him and he gave an interview to the BBC without clearing it with the club .

"Kell Brook could have had the blockbuster fight he craves against Amir Khan instead of treading water against Frankie Gavin, if only his promoter had minded his words. Now that Battle of Britain – potentially at Wembley Stadium – may never take place. So says Khan's father Shah as his son gets ready to finally confirm the over-criticised Chris Algieri as his opponent in New York on the same night when Brook will be defending his world welterweight title against Gavin at London's O2 Arena on May 20 . Promoter Eddie Hearn (centre) stands behind Kell Brook (left) and Frankie Gavin at the O2 Arena . Amir Khan celebrates his victory over Devon Alexander at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas last year . Shah Khan, who also supervises affairs, says: 'Kell could have had his chance against Amir right now if Eddie Hearn had toned it down. But instead of being patient he's been so disrespectful. 'If he carries on like that the Brook fight will not take place. He keeps shouting about how much the fight is worth but I don't care about the money. For Amir it's more about the big fights and his status in boxing. 'Amir's told Kell he will be happy to box him in the next year but Eddie's jeopardising that. He carries on calling us out and insulting us. Any more of that and it will be all over. 'Kell has said plenty, too. But we don't think this is his fault. He seems a good lad. It's Eddie putting the words in his mouth.' Initially, Hearn's provocative manoeuvres came as a surprise to the rival camp. Khan Snr says: 'Eddie will talk reasonably in the negotiating room. Pleasant with us. But as soon as he gets outside he starts with the nonsense.' Hearn (centre) speaks during a press conference to announce the fight between Brook and Gavin . Khan (right) poses for a photo alongside father Shah (centre) and brother Haroon in Sheffield in 2013 . The Khans see a telling parable with the way Junior Witter's critical harassment of Ricky Hatton offended the Hitman. 'Ricky became annoyed and it was hard to blame him,' says Shah. 'It was a fight he would have been happy to take but when the words became unpleasant he walked away for good. 'And what's happened to Witter after that? Virtually nothing. Now he's more less forgotten. I can see the same happening to Kell. 'Yet Brook is a fight Amir would have been more than happy to have. We feel it's a fairly comfortable fight for us. Kell has done OK but we sense that as soon as he comes up against a fighter of Amir's elite level he will be found out. 'Eddie needs to calm down.' If what is being described as the biggest domestic fight in waiting is to become reality, it is over to you Mr Hearn. Eddie, a fellow columnist here at Sportsmail, has pushed through a number of matches with his outspoken pubic challenges. But last week he drew a frosty response from Carl Frampton and his legendary promoter Barry McGuigan when he brandished at them a cheque for £1.5million for the Belfast Jackal to meet his man Scott Quigg in a world super-bantamweight title unification fight. Brook (left) and Gavin (right) go face to face as promoter Hearn looks on in the background . Hearn displays the cheque for £1.5m to set-up Scott Quigg's fight with Carl Frampton . Khan has taken flak for lining up Algieri for his next fight, after the New Yorker was decked six times en route to an embarrassing, wipe-out defeat by Manny Pacquaio. But Algieiri did defeat the previously feared Russian puncher Ruslan Provodnikov to win the world lightweight title, which he still holds. And Khan says: 'Gavin hasn't done anything to compare with that. Sadly Frankie's recent performances against comparatively weak opposition have been anything but convincing. Good luck to him getting the pay-night but he's done nothing to justify this world title shot.' Khan jumped the gun in announcing Algieri and the May 20 date at the Barclays Center in New York, since his advisor Al Haymon was still finalising the deal. Chris Algieri (left) takes on Manny Pacquiao in a WBO welterweight title bout in Macau last year . But all seems to be in place now and the official statement should come this week. Khan was criticised, also, for allegedly declining the IBF offer of a final eliminator against Tim Bradley for Brook's belt. Khan Snr says: 'We couldn't really see the point of an eliminator a fight which Brook is so desperate to have.' His son was also accused of being less than truthful for saying he knew nothing about the offer. But there are suggestions that the secretive Haymon dismissed the IBF offer out of hand, without informing Khan. Paul Smith, having bravely lost his two challenges to Arthur Abraham in Germany, now finds himself in pole position for a third successive joust against a reigning world super-middleweight champion. Only this time the elder of Liverpool's fine family of four fighting brothers will not be boxing for a title, even though it is against a far more formidable champion. Andre Ward, still ranked by many among the top five pound-for-pound boxers in the world despite 17 months out of the ring, sees Smith as the ideal warm-up opponent, possibly before a rematch with Carl Froch. Paul Smith (right) throws a punch towards Arthur Abraham during their title fight in Berlin in February . Virgil Hunter, California-based trainer of both Ward and Amir Khan, says: 'Smith is who we want and I'm told it's a done deal. But it won't be for Andre's belt even though it will be over the 12-round championship distance.' The WBA have ordered their two super-middle world champions – Ward 'super,' Froch 'regular' – to meet in a unification fight. Froch declared willingness if Ward returns the compliment by travelling to the UK, having won their first meeting in the US. Ward said he would make the away trip but only as far as London, not to Nottingham where Froch has long desired to box on his hometown City Ground. Andre Ward (left) poses with his many title belts after defeating Edwin Rodriguez in November 2013 . Hunter declares: 'Andre would have gladly taken Carl straight away.' But now it appears the WBA are granting the so-called Son of God licence to shake off the ring rust where he almost always fights, in his native city across the Bay from San Francisco. Froch, meanwhile, is turning his attention to his other remaining ambition before retirement – a first appearance on the Las Vegas Strip, against the namesake son of Mexican legend Julio Cesar Chavez. Step into Oakland's Oracle Arena, Paul Smith. Good luck to him, in every sense of the phrase.

"It is easy to understand the distaste that so many feel for Floyd Mayweather Jr. He is brash, he can be crass, and when it comes to being a braggart, he is the undisputed world champion. He is the cartoon embodiment of the excess for which his adopted home town of Las Vegas is notorious. A poor kid from Grand Rapids, Michigan, he has spent his adult life over-compensating for the deprivation he once knew. He has tossed handfuls of $100 bills into the air at a strip club and hurled wads of cash into a swimming pool so he could amuse himself by watching girls dive to retrieve them. The mouthguard he will wear during ‘The Fight of the Century’ with Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand on Saturday night cost $25,000 and is inlaid with a $100 bill. Floyd Mayweather Jr is boxing’s undisputed braggart - and a brilliant performer in the ring . Mayweather will take on Manny Pacquiao on Saturday in the most eagerly awaited fight of the century . Some novelists like to assign names to their protagonists that reflect their character traits or their obsessions. Mayweather has saved everyone the trouble with his chosen nickname. John Self, meet Money Mayweather. Money Mayweather reigned until the build-up to this fight began. Then, he took to referring to himself as TBE, or The Best Ever. He is better than Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Robinson ever were, Mayweather said this week. Mayweather, it is also worth pointing out, has faced a string of accusations of violence against women and spent two months in the Clark County Detention Center in 2012 for a domestic violence conviction. Although the fight is not quite the struggle between light and darkness that Pacquiao’s supporters would have you believe, it is true that Mayweather is not exactly a gentleman hero. But in sport’s spoiled, sycophantic world where no one ever tells the genius that he is out of line, that hardly makes him unusual. A floored George Foreman feels the force of Muhammad Ali after his rope-a-dope tactic in the heat of Zaire . Sugar Ray Leonard (right) goes toe-to-toe with Thomas Hearns in their second fight in 1989 . There is a danger here, though. It lies in confusing our perceptions of Mayweather as a man with a desire to belittle his capabilities as a fighter. You might want him to lose to Pacquiao but you better accept that he probably won’t. He is as close to genius as it gets in modern boxing. He may not be The Best Ever. Debates aimed at placing that crown on one head are, essentially, specious but it is legitimate to claim that Mayweather is one of the best ever. He has fought the best fighters of his generation, Pacquiao aside, and beaten every one of them. Pacquiao’s trainer, Freddie Roach, said last week that Mayweather, 38, had ducked too many fighters to be considered the greatest even of this era. A cursory examination of Mayweather’s record does not bear that out. He has fought Diego Corrales, Jose Luis Castillo, Arturo Gatti, Sharmba Mitchell, Oscar de la Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Juan Manuel Marquez, Shane Mosley and Miguel Cotto and sent them all away broken. He has won titles at five different weights. He has fought men like Victor Ortiz and Robert Guerrero, who were supposed to be new forces in boxing, but whose limitations were exposed by Mayweather’s ringcraft. That is the great irony of his dominance of the sport these past few years. He is scorned as a great vulgarian, a gaudy show-off, boxing’s thug king, and yet more than any other modern fighter he embodies the mastery of some of its finest skills. Mayweather attacks Robert Guerrero during the his unanimous points win over his countryman . Mayweather floored Victor Ortiz in controversial fashion at the end of the fourth round . Boxing has always venerated the artist and swooned over practitioners of the sweet science and Mayweather personifies so much of what the purists admire. He does not club his foes into submission. He does not overwhelm them with savagery. He beats them with craft and cleverness. He is a wonderful technician in the mould of Willie Pep, Pernell ‘Sweet Pea’ Whitaker and Ali. The shoulder roll he uses to protect his head and body from attack is a conundrum that none of his opponents have been able to decode. He is a pugilist, not a scrapper. When Mayweather boxes, it is to put on an old-fashioned masterclass in the oft-neglected art of defensive combat. He makes himself devilishly hard to hit, and, slowly and steadily, picks off his opponent. His style has made fans of connoisseurs like the late, great fight trainer Eddie Futch. Mayweather is not a crowd-pleaser. He is too good for that. He is so skilled that it is difficult for his opponent to land effective punches. His brand of brilliance does not make for explosive action but it does make for W after W after W on his record. He has 47 of them now to go with no defeats and no draws. Mayweather has attracted criticism for his uncouth displays of his wealth on social media . Freddie Roach (right) is attemtping to force Mayweather to abandon his naturally cautious style . Roach says he has attended Mayweather fights where fans have fallen asleep from boredom. He is trying to goad Mayweather into abandoning his usual style because he knows it represents Pacquiao’s best chance — perhaps only chance — of winning. Roach is a good man and a brilliant trainer but Money Mayweather is way too smart to fall for that. I take him to win by unanimous decision. Pep’s T-shirt protest is no crime, UEFA . UEFA have a chance to claw back at least a little of the dignity and the credibility they have lost in recent years when their disciplinary panel meets on May 21 to consider whether to fine Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola. Guardiola committed the heinous sin of expressing an opinion about something more important than football at his press conference last Monday before Bayern’s Champions League tie with Porto. The punishment for that kind of deviancy is severe if precedent is anything to go by. Football’s twisted world fines you more heavily for wearing branded underpants than indulging in racist chanting. Guardiola wore the top demanding justice for Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez who died in a car crash at the World Cup . Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez was killed when a taxi he was travelling back to his hotel in was hit by a stolen car . Guardiola’s crime is to have worn a T-shirt highlighting unanswered issues surrounding the death of a popular and respected Argentinian sports journalist during last year’s World Cup. Jorge ‘Topo’ Lopez, who was a friend of Lionel Messi and Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone, was killed in a car crash in Belo Horizonte and several details of the incident are yet to be explained. So Guardiola did the right thing. He wore a shirt bearing the slogan #JusticiaParaTopo. And sure enough, his charge ‘for an incident of a non-sporting nature’ will now be judged by UEFA next month. It is strange, isn’t it, how we condemn our footballers for being one-dimensional and bemoan their lack of social conscience and say they are all spoiled little rich boys. And then as soon as they do something a bit different, as soon as they challenge us, as soon as they break free from the norm, UEFA come down on them like a ton of bricks. If they have any sense left, they will dismiss the charge against Guardiola out of hand. Arsenal's clash with Chelsea at the Emirates  has little relevance for this season’s title race. Chelsea are too far ahead for the result to matter. But it matters for next season. Arsenal, finally, are beginning to look like a team capable of fashioning a real challenge for the title again. They have improved this season despite being without three of their leading players, Jack Wilshere, Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, for much of the campaign. By winning at Manchester City and sweeping Liverpool aside, they have started to overcome psychological barriers. Beat Chelsea and another of those barriers will have been shoved out of the way. Chelsea went five points clear after beating Arsenal 2-0 in October with  Eden Hazard and Diego Costa scoring . Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho face off during the last meeting between the two sides .","Floyd Mayweather is brash, he can be crass, and when it comes to being a braggart, he is the undisputed world champion .
Previously known as Money Mayweather, he took to referring to himself as TBE, or The Best Ever in the build-up to his fight with Manny Pacquiao .
He said this week he is better than Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Robinson ever were .
He is scorned as a great vulgarian and yet more than any other modern fighter he embodies the mastery of some of its finest skills .
You might want him to lose to Manny Pacquiao but you better accept that he probably won’t. He is as close to genius as it gets in modern boxing ."
"Over the past week or so I’ve been speaking to people who knew Jimmy Anderson in his early days. The Antigua Test, of course, will be his 100th, and he needs only four wickets – a morning’s and evening’s work with two new balls, perhaps? – to go past Ian Botham’s England record of 383. But some illuminating discussions left me wishing I’d had them before – and not waited until cricket’s statistical God tapped us all on the shoulder. A few themes recurred: Jimmy wouldn’t say boo to a goose; he surprised his new Lancashire colleagues by bowling fast and shaping it away; he was a natural. James Anderson needs just three wickets to go level with Sir Ian Botham as England's top Test wicket taker . Anderson (back, second from left) 'wouldn’t say boo to a goose' says his old county captain Warren Hegg . Anderson trains ahead of the first Test in Antigua on Monday, which will be his 100th for England . It was this last point that was most striking. Unlike the majority of England cricketers, Anderson did not ease effortlessly through the age groups. There’s even a suggestion Lancashire failed to spot his talent first time round, and needed to witness him at a second trial before they were convinced. Instead, he played for Burnley CC, a club which produced more than its share of first-class cricketers: the Brown brothers, Michael and David, John Clare, and Vishal Tripathi. So when he was finally snapped up by Lancashire Under-17s, he was very much in the raw. John Stanworth, who was then Lancashire’s player development manager, told me that coaches from other counties would pass comment on Anderson’s idiosyncrasies, not least his habit of looking at his feet as he delivered the ball. The retort was a simple one: Anderson was bowling fast and getting good batsmen out. Stanworth was wise enough to leave him alone, with one exception: at one stage, his back leg started coming behind his body, and he began running on the pitch. Anderson and his first England captain Nasser Hussain celebrate a wicket during the 2003 World Cup . England quick James Anderson plays his 100th Test match in Antigua against the West Indies from Monday . A session with Bob Cottam sorted that. Otherwise, Stanworth allowed Anderson to blossom, unencumbered by technical advice. Guess what happened? As soon Anderson got involved in the England Under-19 set-up, he mislaid his awayswinger. It took Lancashire coach Mike Watkinson – once a swing bowler himself – to reacquaint him with some fundamental truths about the art. Anderson’s next departure from the natural game that had served him so well came not long after his first taste of senior international cricket. From now on, the Top Spin will be shorter, sharper, more regular and maybe even more personal. For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin . Between the end of the home summer in 2004 and the start of the 2006-07 Ashes, Anderson played two Tests – a disaster in Johannesburg and a triumph in Mumbai. But England had won the 2005 Ashes without him, and he had spent much of the time bowling by himself, at a cone, in some corner of a foreign field or other. For England’s much-praised fast-bowling coach of the time, Troy Cooley, Anderson felt like the one that got away. When Peter Moores took charge of England in the summer of 2007, he encouraged Anderson to be himself. The rest is history (and that, by the way, is a feather in Moores’s cap that often gets forgotten). Peter Moores deserves credit for allowing Anderson to play his natural game when on England duty . Anderson has always been at his best when allowed simply to bowl his natural away-swinging deliveries . So there you have it. The man who is about to become England’s leading Test wicket-taker of all time has always been at his best when others have left him alone, when his head has not been filled with well-meaning technical advice, when he has just run in and – heaven be praised – swung it as naturally as breathing comes to you and me. There is a lesson here for English cricket. For all the time and money invested at the national academy in Loughborough, England’s best bowler has been at his most potent when he has done it his way. In Pakistan, the cricket community intuitively understands the importance of this: Nasser Hussain even described Anderson as ‘un-English – more like a Pakistani’. In England, the cricket community errs on the side of over-instruction. Thank goodness Anderson stuck to his guns.","Jimmy Anderson could move past Ian Botham's record during first Test .
Anderson is just four wickets away from beating Botham's tally of 383 .
The Lancashire fast bowler has always been a natural swing bowler .
Lowest points of Anderson's career have come with too much tinkering .
Peter Moores deserves credit for allowing bowler to be himself for England ."
"JT’s NEVER BEEN BETTER . Jose Mourinho's return was the answer to John Terry’s prayers. Mourinho said Sunday's game at the Emirates was the best Terry had ever played. That was a pat on the back for his captain but also justification for Mourinho’s faith in playing him. Terry is in a real purple patch and his reading of the game is better than ever. Part of his success comes from the way the team is set up in front of him. All of their good work means he is in prime position each time to make the telling tackle or interception. John Terry (left) was in inspiring form in the Chelsea defence as his side kept a clean sheet against Arsenal . Sportsmail's Martin Keown says the Blues skipper is enjoying some of the best football of his career . The 34-year-old defender's timing in the tackle has been impeccable for the majority this season . His decision-making is excellent and he waits for the perfect moment to get involved — there can be an element of gambling with that but it is a calculated risk. He was always able to anticipate where Arsenal wanted to play the game and stop them from doing it. As Chelsea have become harder to beat, Terry has come into his own. Following an entertaining first half, Arsenal's tempo appeared to drop after the half time break . GHOSTS OF MONACO? In the first half Arsenal played at a terrific tempo, especially down the left, but the whistle came at the perfect time for Chelsea. After the break Arsenal didn’t move the ball quickly enough. They looked mindful of the Monaco game where they lost control but here there was not enough spark. Gunners striker Olivier Giroud had a frustrating afternoon against a rugged Chelsea defence . Danny Welbeck's pace through the middle could have instead caused the Chelsea back line a lot trouble . A MISSED OPPORTUNITY . I’m a big fan of Olivier Giroud but Arsenal needed to ask a different question of the Chelsea defence. John Terry and Gary Cahill are built to deal with players like Giroud and everything was played in front of them. If Danny Welbeck had played through the middle, his pace could have unsettled Chelsea. It’s much easier to be compact when there’s no threat in behind. The Arsenal supporters were heard lamenting Chelsea's 'boring' performance at the Emirates Stadium . Despite many questioning Chelsea's tactics in the big games Jose Mourinho's team are in full control . JOSE IS ALWAYS THE BOSS . The Arsenal fans said it was boring but Chelsea are doing what they need to do to see out a championship. There is no problem with that. If anything that element of control is something Arsenal would do well to copy. Yes, there was no striker but could Didier Drogba really play three games in a row at 37? Jose just made good use of his squad. At the start of the season Chelsea played with so much expression it looked like the players were in charge. Now they look dogged, disciplined and firmly in control. There is no doubt as to who is the boss now.","Martin Keown: Danny Welbeck's pace might have unsettled Chelsea .

"STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE . This game is being billed as Beauty v the Beast, but don’t underestimate Arsene Wenger. It’s not just about style — he plays to win. The philosophy Wenger has imposed has made Arsenal popular throughout the world. People love to watch them, certainly more than Jose Mourinho’s teams. But on Sunday, he is up against the ultimate pragmatist — Mourinho finds any way to win. Chelsea have conceded just two goals in their last six clashes with Arsenal, keeping four clean sheets in the process. Mourinho does exactly what’s necessary. So while Wenger always aims to win, he still cares about the brand of football played. Mourinho’s brand is winning. Arsene Wenger (left) pushed Jose Mourinho when Chelsea beat Arsenal 6-0 at Stamford Bridge last season . Wenger can not be underestimated, according to Martin Keown... it's not all about style, he plays to win . TALKING TACTICS . Arsenal should dominate possession while Chelsea are more likely to sit deep and use the electric pace of Eden Hazard and Willian on the break. Chelsea will be very disciplined and in some ways that is a shame because the players aren’t allowed to express themselves as they might. In the reverse fixture in October, Chelsea pressed Arsenal all over and Wenger’s side were stifled — they did not get a shot on target for the first time in a Premier League match since 2003. Jose creates such an intensity and focus that winning becomes a matter of life and death. But Arsenal will send waves of players forward at pace and try to isolate Branislav Ivanovic, Gary Cahill and John Terry, who are not the quickest. Keown (right) and Wenger go back a long way, after Keown's two stints at Arsenal during his career . Chelsea boss Mourinho always finds a way to win and has a brilliant record against Wenger . CHANGE THE RECORD . Mourinho's record over Wenger is remarkable. Not many managers can say they have never lost to Arsene Wenger. Jose feels he knows Wenger’s game and the Arsenal boss can’t surprise him. I’d be amazed if Chelsea go all out to attack, but they will still pack a punch on the break. FLAVOUR OF THE MONTH . Jose wants to win every trophy going but he has a poor record in the Premier League Manager of the Month award. He has only won it three times, the same as Alan Curbishley and one fewer than Joe Kinnear. Wenger has won it 14 times. THE CESC DIFFERENCE . Cesc Fabregas has enjoyed a brilliant season at Chelsea but I don’t think he would have necessarily benefited Arsenal had he joined. That central midfield area is very congested and he would have halted Aaron Ramsey’s progress. But one thing is certain on Sunday — he won’t receive a warm welcome. Mourinho has a poor Premier League Manager of the Month record; he has won as many as Alan Curbishley . Cesc Fabregas has been impressive this season, but he wouldn't necessarily have been as good with Arsenal .","Chelsea travel to the Emirates to face Arsenal on Sunday afternoon .
Jose Mourinho has an impressive record against Arsene Wenger .
Despite that, Wenger cannot be underestimated - he plays to win .
Cesc Fabregas has impressed this season, but he would not necessarily have had the same impact if he had joined Arsenal from Barcelona ."
"Sami Khedira is still weighing up his next move but has interest from Manchester United and Chelsea. United have maintained an interest in the Germany international since failing to sign him in August 2013. His representatives have spoken to Schalke on a number of occasions but the fifth placed Bundesliga side have been struggling to come up with a suitable financial package while he also has concerns about the strength of their squad. They have been scouting for alternatives should he turn them down. Although Khedira said last month: 'I love Real Madrid and it'll be hard to leave this club - I'll give all I've got until the last moments of my contract, let nobody doubt that', Real will not now offer him a new deal. Sami Khedira is being courted by several clubs including Manchester United and Chelsea . Khedira has not played as often as he would have liked at Real Madrid since last summer's World Cup . They are also looking to sell Spain international Asier Illaramendi with Real Sociedad, Liverpool and Arsenal all interested in a cut-price £18million deal. Khedira was a target for Arsenal and his free agent status will give him more options but his salary of £190,000 a week at 28-years-old is not so easy to accommodate. Niggling injuries have also helped limit him to just 17 appearances for Madrid since the World Cup. United have also discussed the possibility of reviving their interest in Paris St Germain's energetic midfielder Blaise Matuidi if a deal can be struck. Dortmund's Ilkay Gundogan and Mats Hummels remain on their list too. Manchester City striker Stevan Jovetic hopes to have a clearer idea later on Wednesday of whether he will be able to join Inter Milan. His representatives are meeting the Italian club's officials to outline what proposals can be put forward to City. The Montenegrin is desperate to join Inter but there are doubts whether they can match City's valuation particularly with Yaya Toure also in their thoughts. Their initial proposal for Jovetic is likely to be a loan with a view, something City are not keen on. Inter are prepared to sell to fund their rebuild with former defender Nemanja Vidic among the candidates to go. Inter Milan are keen to thrash out a deal for Stevan Jovatic (left) and are also keen on Yaya Toure (right) City may yet offer him as part of their ambitious bid for Raheem Sterling although Liverpool insist they will not sell. Chelsea remain interested in Sterling also. James Milner remains a free transfer option for Liverpool but, as reported in Sportsmail at the weekend, he has yet to determine where he will go with offers from Arsenal, Everton, Roma, Inter Milan and two Spanish clubs also on the table. He has not ruled out staying at City with the amount of game time pivotal to his decision. Sunderland have agreed deals to bring in Manchester City youngsters Cameron McCulloch, a goalkeeper, and Josh Maja, a striker, from Manchester City U18s. Juventus and Monaco are understood to have held discussions this week about the possibility of a deal for Radamel Falcao. The striker is expected to return to the Principality from his loan at Manchester United at the end of the season. Juventus tried to sign him last summer but could not afford the financial package. They want to revamp their strike force with Carlos Tevez looking to return to Argentina with Boca Juniors and Fernando Llorente expected to be sold. Radamel Falcao's Manchester United nightmare could be coming to an end as Juventus consider a move . Newcastle United are considering the merits of Fulham striker Ross McCormack for the summer. Newcastle are working on a deal for QPR's Charlie Austin and have checked on the likes of Danny Ings, Aleksandar Mitrovic, Alexandre Lacazette and Moussa Konate. Steve McClaren is expected to take over the reins at Newcastle in the summer and was keen to take McCormack to Derby during the January transfer window. Mccormack was signed for £11m and Fulham would want the bulk of their money back for a player who has still managed 15 goals in a struggling side. Fulham plan major changes in the summer and want to bring in some big signings to push for promotion but will also need to balance the books should suitable offers come in. Ross McCormack has had an impressive season despite Fulham's struggles in the Championhip . Stoke are discussing a summer deal for Barcelona B forward Mohamed el Ouriachi. The 19-year-old left winger, known as Moha, has turned down a new deal at Barca and is ready to follow former Barcelona players Marc Muniesa and Bojan Krkic to the Britannia. Moha's agent Raul Verdu said: 'We thank Barca for the deal they offered the player and the efforts they have gone to try to renew his contract. But another proposal was really interesting on both a professional and economic level. Moha has the option of joining the first team squad at Stoke and that was irresistible.' Moha, a Spain youth international, rejected the chance to join Real Madrid in 2011. Mark Hughes is also interested in signing Daniel Wass from Evian and will discuss a permanent deal for Victor Moses of Chelsea as he looks to inject pace into his squad. Sunderland's Lee Cattermole remains a midfield target too. Mohamed el Ouriachi is ready to follow former Barcelona players Marc Muniesa and Bojan Krkic to Stoke . Valencia and Monaco are monitoring Chelsea winger Gael Kakuta. Currently impressing on-loan with Rayo Vallecano, Kakuta is still has one year left on contract at Chelsea. The 23 year-old is available for around £3million with Udinese and Atalanta are also interested. Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer is due to hold crucial talks with owners Venky's about how to work around the club's transfer embargo. Bowyer has been hemmed in by financial restrictions yet still managed to lead Blackburn to the brink of play-off qualification and the FA Cup quarter finals. His work has been recognised at other clubs considering managerial changes but he is keen to finish what he has started by taking Blackburn up to the Premier League next season. Rovers have been under embargo since January after falling foul of the Football League's new financial fair play regulations. Key to discussions in India will be whether they accept bids for Rudy Gestede and Jordan Rhodes with Southampton, Crystal Palace, Middlesbrough and Hull interested at the right price. Jordan Rhodes (left) and Rudy Gestede (right) have been linked with moves away from Blackburn Rovers . Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi is being monitored by Premier League sides as Wigan look to slip out of the Championship into League One. The experienced Oman goalkeeper is free in he summer and has returned to fitness this season with some good performances despite his team's demise. Liverpool have been among the many clubs to have posted scouts at the DW Stadium this season although they have checked on their loanees Jerome Sinclair and Sheyi Ojo also. Liverpool have been looking at Sporting keeper Rui Patricio after being told Norberto Neto would join Juventus but may need a low budget option too. Everton are posied to make David Henen's loan from Olympiakos permanent after the teenager impressed. Everton are looking at bringing in a new goalkeeper, centre-back and two strikers for next season. Club scouts watched Fiorentina against Juventus in the Coppa Italia last week and also checked on Bayer Leverkusen's cup game with Bayern Munich as they see what is available in the market. Antolin Alcaraz and Sylvain Distin will be among the players to depart.","Sami Khedira will not be offered a new deal by Real Madrid .

"Paris Saint-Germain have opened primary discussions with Paul Pogba over a possible move from Juventus. The Italian champions were kept informed even though no formal offer has yet been made to the club for the France international. Pogba and his representatives are understood to have met PSG president Nasser Al Khelaifi in Monte Carlo on Tuesday. When asked the president replied told French press: 'Why did I meet with Pogba? Because he’s a great talent, he’s French and he’s from Paris. That said, all the big clubs want him.' Barcelona have also shown an intention to bid for Pogba. Their transfer embargo however means a deal would be agreed where the player remains in Turin until next January. Paris Saint-Germain have opened primary discussions with Paul Pogba over a possible move from Juventus . PSG striker Edinson Cavani has a meeting scheduled with his brother and agent on Wednesday as he discusses his options. PSG do not wish to sell the striker but Cavani is intrigued by calls from Juventus. Atletico Madrid have also expressed an interest with Mario Mandzukic weighing up offers from England. PSG striker Edinson Cavani is considering his options and could be set for a move away from Paris . Sevilla are weighing up a return for Manchester City winger Jesus Navas. The 29-year-old has had a decent run in City's first team of late but overall has been disappointing since his £15million transfer from Sevilla in 2013. Navas has had his family around him in Manchester, including his brother Marco playing briefly for Bury, yet he is understood to be interested in a return to Spain. Finance will be a stumbling block even though Sevilla are challenging to qualify for the Champions League. They will not be able to match Navas's wages and would offer around £7million. Sevilla are weighing up a move for Manchester City's 29-year-old winger Jesus Navas . Yaya Toure remains Inter Milan's main transfer target for the summer despite the obvious financial difficulties of signing a 31-year-old player on £200,000 a week. They have drawn up a provisional back-up list which as reported previously in Sportsmail includes Alex Song of Barcelona and Lucas Leiva of Liverpool. Another player who has come into their reckoning though is Udinese's Allan Marques Loureiro. The 24-year-old Brazilian is a box to box midfielder and also has a Portuguese passport. Song, on loan at West Ham, also has interest from AC Milan. The Rossoneri could be in new ownership soon as Silvio Berlusconi will meet with prospective buyer Bee Taechaubol tonight. Inter are continuing to work on a loan deal for Stevan Jovetic at City too. City midfielder Yaya Toure (left) remains Inter Milan's main transfer target for the summer . Stoke have made an enquiry about Dnipro flyer Yevhen Konoplyanka. The Ukraine winger was the subject of a failed bid from Liverpool over a year ago but will be out of contract in the summer. Tottenham had a deal in place earlier this year but that has now been shelved while Everton also wanted to sign him. The 25-year-old has been offered £2.5million a year tax free by Turkish side Galatasaray yet is keen on a move to the Premier League or Italy where Roma have the strongest interest. Stoke are unlikely to be his destination but they are showing ambition in their moves this window and want to inject pace with their latest signings. They have held talks about a £4m deal for Evian's Daniel Wass, 25, and asked about Yannick Bolasie of Crystal Palace. Stoke also had scouts at Le Havre last weekend to watch defender Ferland Mendy, 19, who has interest from Sampdoria, Sporting Braga, Standard Liege and Basle too. Stoke have made an enquiry about Yevhen Konoplyanka (left), who will be out of contract this summer . Everton have interest from clubs in midfielder Mohamed Besic. The 22-year-old German-born Bosnia international has shown glimpses of his potential this season following his £4.8m arrival from Ferencvaros last summer. He also impressed at the World Cup in Brazil. Besic has picked up 11 yellow cards and can tread a fine line disciplinary-wise at times but Everton are keen to keep him. Roberto Martinez is a confirmed fan but the fact Besic has not started regularly has prompted clubs to check whether there is potential to strike a deal. Everton are looking for another midfielder, two forwards and a left-sided centre-back. They have also checked on Aberdeen's promising midfielder Ryan Jack, 23. Interest from Arsenal and Tottenham also remains in James McCarthy but his price tag or Everton's reluctance to listen to offers will make that difficult. 22-year-old Everton midfielder Mohamed Besic has been attracting interest from European clubs . Real Madrid may need to pay Iker Casillas £10million to leave. The future of the 33-year-old goalkeeper is under scrutiny every day and his form has not been what is should be. That has prompted more calls for Madrid to bring in David de Gea from Manchester United but first Casillas would need to move on. He is contracted until 2017 and earns around £5.75m a year. In terms of recognition for his service, his advisers would push for the club to pay him his outstanding salary on the contract. Real Madrid could end up paying veteran goalkeeper Iker Casillas £10million to leave the club . David de Gea is tempted by a return to Madrid but has still to decisively make up his mind on when that should be. Although Arsenal have been linked with Casillas, there are reservations about his form, something that has also been questioned within the Madrid dressing room. MLS sides and those in the Middle East have shown an interest in Casillas should he opt to go. Key for Madrid, and United, is that any impending transfer ban will either accelerate decisions to buy or put blocks on sales. David de Gea is tempted with a move to Madrid, but could yet stay loyal to Manchester United . Crystal Palace and West Brom have shown an interest in Montpellier defender Daniel Congre. Congre, 30, can play at right-back, centre-back and left-back. He could be available for a cut-price deal of just £1.4m. The defender is currently considering a contract extension from the Ligue 1 outfit. Crystal Palace and West Brom have shown an interest in Montpellier defender Daniel Congre (left) Bradford City striker Billy Clarke is a man in demand this summer.

"The richest fight of all time continues to break through the barriers of history – mostly in terms of financial records, naturally. For the first time in the annals of boxing – as Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao step on the scales next Friday – fans will be charged for admission to a weigh-in. This formality for checking that combatants weigh no more than the stipulated poundage for each division started to become an event in its own right in 2007 when Ricky Hatton went to Las Vegas to take his Man Of La Mancha tilt at the Mayweather windmill. Floyd Mayweather with girlfriend Doralie Medina (left) and Manny Pacquiao with his wife Jinkee (right) Pacquiao with his wife and  children (left to right) Michael, Israel, Emmanuel, Princess and Queen Elizabeth . Mayweather visits SubZero Recovery in Las Vegas, a new-age version of the ice bath . No fewer than 30,000 of the Manchester Hitman's army followed him across the Atlantic and thousands of them turned up for the weigh-in. The atmosphere was electrified when Hatton yelled 'let's be having him' as Mayweather was about to follow him onto the stage. Hatton would be knocked out but there was more of the same when he went back to the MGM Grand to suffer the same fate against Pacquiao two years later. Since then weigh-ins there have turned into sound and light spectacles, taking place inside the Grand Garden Arena itself, and the audiences keep growing. The decision to sell tickets for this one has been made in the interests of safety, not profit. Up to 200,000 visitors are expected to pour into Vegas this fight week and the MGM need to control the crowds at all the associated events. Thousands of fans watched Ricky Hatton and Mayweather weigh-in at the MGM Grand Garden Arena . Hatton points towards the crowd during his heated weigh-in with Mayweather in December 2007 . Mayweather poses in his TMT clothing as he takes a break from training over the weekend . To avoid accusations of cashing in on the phenomenon the hotel and both promoters – Mayweather and Top Rank – will donate all revenue from the weigh-in to charities nominated by the Money Man and the PacMan. Mayweather and Pacquiao will be required to weigh not more than 10st 7lbs. The winner will unify the WBC (Mayweather) and WBO (Pacquiao) world welterweight titles. Wladimir Klitschko, as he makes a rare appearance in the US this Saturday, admits that at 39 he has to start considering when he might hang up those huge gloves. However, assuming he adds Bryant Jennings to his long list of victims, that will not happen before Dr Iron Fist has obliged the two young pretenders to his heavyweight throne. Namely our own Tyson Fury and America's KO sensation Deontay Wilder. Wladimir Klitschko has admitted that he is considering retirement as he approaches his 40th birthday . Klitschko says: 'I do have to start thinking about retirement.' But then the Ukrainian who boxes mostly to sell-out crowds in German football stadia, adds: 'I would like to fight Fury, which would be a huge event in Europe. 'I want to fight Wilder, to add the only remaining belt to my unified world titles.' Unusually, both men would present Klitschko with opposition as tall or, in Fury's case, even taller than his own 6ft 6in. Fury is his mandatory challenger for the WBO title. Wilder holds the WBC title which was vacated by Klitschko's brother Vitali when he retired to concentrate on the violent complexities of Ukrainian politics as Mayor of Kiev. WBC heavyweight champions Deontay Wilder looks set to face Klitschko before he hangs up his gloves . Wladimir is also the WBA, IBF, IBO and Ring magazine champion. There is another factor which will tempt him to prolong his reign even further. Currently he ranks fourth in the all-time list of successive world heavyweight title defences, with 18. Victories over Jennings – which looks to be something of a formality in New York's Madison Square Garden, would lift him level with Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes on 19. If he adds wins over Fury and Wilder he will close to within just four victories of the 25-defences record held by Joe Louis. That is likely to be an opportunity too good to refuse. Tyson Fury, pictured in action against Dereck Chisora, is Klitschko's mandatory challenger for the WBO title . The crushing defeat of Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr by the largely unheralded and, in terms of his first name, unpronounceable Pole Andrzej Fonfara, complicates Carl Froch's exit strategy from the ring. One of Froch's two dream scenarios has been a farewell fight in Las Vegas, probably against Chavez with his box office appeal for America's Hispanic population and fans south of the border in Mexico. But the namesake son of an idolised father was so badly beaten up through nine rounds in California by Fonfara – suffering the first knock down of his career in the process – that he quit on his stool. Carl Froch could choose to retire after Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr's defeat by Andrzej Fonfara last week . Inadvisedly, Chavez had agreed to a catch-weight fight with light-heavyweight contender Fonfara and is talking about going back down to Froch's super-middleweight division. Whether this former middleweight champion would still be a draw after this setback is doubtful and Froch had said before the fight that it would hurt his plans 'if Chavez got knocked out. The other swansong ambition – to fight on the City Ground of his beloved Nottingham Forest – suffered a setback when Andre Ward agreed to come to England for their mandatory WBA title unifier but not to Froch's home town. Retirement is becoming an increasingly attractive option for the Cobra.

"A few months ago Aston Villa would have been happy with Premier League survival. Now they have a chance for so much more. In recent years Villa have struggled to compete but they are a proper club. When I left Arsenal for Villa it was because I felt they shared similar traits - tradition, history and both took pride of place in their communities. Villa were one of the founder members of the Football League and in the early years of the FA Cup, the trophy was almost theirs to keep. Now this group has a chance to embrace that history and write the next chapter. Aston Villa celebrate in the Wembley dressing room after beating Liverpool to reach this year's FA Cup final . Martin Keown joined Aston Villa in 1986 and made the move because of the club's rich history and tradition . Tim Sherwood has invigorated this side and you can feel that improvement in their performances. But for all the excitement Villa fans must be patient. Talking about getting a club ‘back where they belong’ can be a dangerous game. Villa won the European Cup in 1982 and while there’s nothing wrong with being ambitious, fans have to be realistic. Previous generations at Villa have seen success and can be too demanding. Even when they were challenging for the Champions League under Martin O’Neill there were still rumblings of discontent. When things do start to go wrong, Villa Park can be an unforgiving place. I experienced that when I was relegated and it can be a difficult place to play. But what ground isn’t when things are going badly? In the past Villa Park has been so loud players could hardly hear themselves think and the atmosphere the fans created at Wembley was magnificent. Now with Sherwood hopefully a generation can grow with his side.

"Ander Herrera's form at Manchester United has not gone unnoticed at Barcelona. The Spanish side have a long-held interest in the 25-year-old as they consider replacements for Xavi. Herrera has impressed the club's scouts throughout his career at Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao and they have monitored his progress at Old Trafford. His absence from the starting line-up earlier this season was noted and they will see whether he continues to figure so prominently once United add further midfielders in the summer. Ander Herrera (right) celebrates with Manchester United team-mate Ashley Young at Old Trafford on Saturday . Herrera (right) scores the opening goal for Manchester United against Aston Villa in the Premier League clash . Former Barcelona director of football Txiki Begiristain also considered Herrera when he first joined Manchester City but the concern has always been about whether he has the physique to withstand the Premier League. So far, he is standing up to it well and has been United's form player of late. United fans need not be too concerned though, Herrera is as considered in his approach off the pitch as he is on it. Although his fledgling United career has had its blips, he is convinced where he is now is best for his career and is planning to stay for the long-term. Xavi, for his part, has options with Qatar's Al Sadd but is discussing staying with Barcelona until their transfer embargo is lifted next January. Xavi (front) in action for Barcelona against Celta Viga in the La Liga match at the Balaidos stadium on Sunday . Manchester United and Stoke City had scouts posted at Pacos de Ferreira last weekend as they played out a 1-1 draw with Sporting Lisbon. United have been continuing to check on Nani's progress while Sporting's £20m-rated centre midfielder William has continued to improve. Stoke like the look of Algeria striker Islam Slimani who scored Sporting's goal. Monaco, Lille, Espanyol and Celta Vigo also had scouts in attendance. Meanwhile, Stoke City, Nottingham Forest, Sunderland and Newcastle are among clubs showing interest in Shrewsbury Town winger Josh Ginnelly. The 18-year-old former Aston Villa trainee has been offered a professional contract but is weighing up his options and could leave this summer. Shrewsbury are second in League Two under manager Micky Mellon and have guaranteed a play-off place. Sporting Lisbon striker Islam Slimani celebrates after scoring for Sporting Lisbon against Pacos de Ferreira . Liverpool will reject Manchester City's proposals for Jordan Henderson as they look to keep the England international at Anfield. The 24-year-old has yet to sign a new contract but is happy at Liverpool and manager Brendan Rodgers is keen for him to stay. Negotiations will continue over the coming weeks. Liverpool's budget and plans will be determined by whether they can qualify for the Champions League. City will face a similar response from Arsenal should they press for Jack Wilshere who is being offered a new contract at The Emirates. Liverpool's Jordan Henderson on the ball during the 4-1 defeat by Arsenal on Saturday . City want the best English players as they look to boost their home grown quota. Their interest in Raheem Sterling is known, they have asked about Burnley's Danny Ings while Southampton's Jay Rodriguez and England U21 international James Ward-Prowse are also on their list. Stoke's Jack Butland and Ryan Shawcross have been discussed as City evaluate potential targets but neither would move to be understudies while Newcastle's Rolando Aarons has also been watched. FA chairman Greg Dyke wants to introduce tougher rules on home grown players from 2016. He wants to phase them in over four years but it would mean players, irrespective of nationality, will have to be with his club from 15 to qualify as home grown; the number of non-home grown players in each 25-man squad is to be reduced from 17 to 13 and at least two home grown players must be club trained. Under those City's Gael Clichy and Dedryck Boyata would no longer be classed as home grown. Raheem Sterling (centre) pictured during a Liverpool training session at Melwood on Monday . Ben Amos has returned to Manchester United following the end of his loan at Bolton Wanderers but could yet return to the Macron Stadium in the summer. The goalkeeper impressed Neil Lennon and won the club's player of the month for March. Amos is out of contract at Old Trafford in the summer and the 24-year-old's displays have alerted other Championship sides also as they consider summer options. Amos has been told he is free to look for another club by United. Cash-strapped Bolton have Adam Bogdan and Andy Lonergan out of contract themselves in the summer and Bogdan is unlikely to stay as Premier League sides circle for the Hungarian. Goalkeeper Ben Amos gestures during a Championship match between Bolton and Millwall last month . Javier Hernandez is poised to turn down overtures from Orlando City to stay in Europe. The Manchester United striker, currently on loan at Real Madrid, has been offered a lucrative deal by MLS standards which is understood to be worth around £2.8m a year over five years, plus commercial spin-offs. Hernandez though can command nearly double that salary in Europe and Bundesliga side Wolfsburg are continuing to show interest as well as AC Milan, Southampton, Stoke, Everton and West Ham. Javier Hernandez (right) looks to challenge Iker Casillas during Real Madrid training on Saturday . Crystal Palace and West Ham are maintaining interest in Sevilla midfielder Stephane Mbia . The 28-year-old is a free agent and his representative Jean-Paul Ndoumin is in early discussions. The former QPR midfielder had an impressive start to the season and has managed seven goals so far. He is keen to prove himself though in England believing he has unfinished business after an inauspicious spell at Loftus Road. Palace held talks in January but were unable to conclude a deal and Alan Pardew will look at a deal again, as will West Ham. West Ham remain among clubs asking to loan Jese Rodriguez from Real Madrid. Everton have also enquired for the talented Spain international who has cut a frustrated figure on the sidelines this season following his return from injury. Madrid would prefer the player to stay but he is keen to play elsewhere until he gets a run in the first team again. Sevilla midfielder Stephane Mbia (right) is challenged by Villareal's Ikechukwu Uche at El Madrigal last month . Southampton are watching Cagliari winger Paul-Jose M'Poku. The former Tottenham junior came close to signing for QPR in January when he was leaving Standard Liege. However, the move stalled as QPR switched focus to Matt Jarvis, Emmanuel Adebayor and Carlton Cole. M'Poku moved instead to Al Arabi but was swiftly loaned out to Italian side Cagliari. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has had decent scouting reports on M'Poku and Al Arabi will sell for £4m. Southampton also want a goalkeeper with Fulham's Maarten Stekelenburg and Reading's Adam Federici among those being considered, while Burnley's Kieran Trippier and Mattias Johansson of AZ Alkmaar are options to replace Nathaniel Clyne.

"It is legendary now that when the Spanish national team was coming to the boil and about to scald world football for six years, La Roja's own fans didn't even know the water was hot. Because they left Spanish soil having eked out two single-goal wins, over Peru and the USA, the booing, whistling and jeering which had pursued them around the peninsula for two years was the last thing they heard before heading off to win Euro 2008. Three trophies later, the senior team is finally in search of a reboot. The identity has been eroded by the passage of time. The transition from excellent to elderly is never fun. Spain lift the trophy at Euro 2008, but their fans had booed them before, not recognising a great team . The World Cup followed in 2010 and now it seems the right time for the old guard to hand over to youngsters . Spain won the European Championships for a second time in a row in 2012 before their World Cup failure . Spain's Under 21s celebrate winning Euro 2013 and their brilliant young players are thriving right now . Nevertheless, the current Champions League quarter-finals are beginning to say something quite interesting about Spain's 'relevo'. If you don't speak Spanish, that term might mean very little to you. But I bet you can intuit. 'Relevo' in this context is like 'relief' — as in the armed forces term for the relief watch. Those who are sent in, fresh and ready, to relieve whichever servicemen or women who have born the brunt of service for the previous day or days. Xavi, Carles Puyol, Xabi Alonso, Carlos Marchena and Joan Capdevila have done their hard miles and it is not clear what toll battle has taken on Victor Valdes, David Villa and Fernando Torres. The natural place to look for fresh, young, well-drilled recruits ready to take on the world is in the Academy graduates. So let's go there. What caught my attention is that Juan Bernat's arrival to the Champions League quarter-final for Bayern Munich at Porto last Wednesday earned Valencia a seven-figure sum as part of the incentives associated with the full back's move to Bavaria. In other words, Bernat was one of those guys, just turned 22, that both Valencia and Bayern thought might be playing 'starting' football at this elite stage of the world's most demanding soccer tournament — but, equally, he might not. The likes of Xavi (right), Barcelona's midfield metronome, have done their hard miles and can now hand over . it is not clear what toll battle has taken on striker Fernando Torres, who now plays for Atletico Madrid . This is the season when he's broken into Vicente del Bosque's senior team, scoring, and formed part of a quite remarkable chain of left backs at the Mestalla — from Jordi Alba, European Champion with Spain in 2012, now at Barcelona, through Bernat to Jose Luis Gaya, a remarkable talent who is currently locked in stalled contract talks at Valencia while Madrid stalk his availability. And if you just look a little more closely then the eight teams left to sort the wheat from the chaff this week show evidence that, beyond Bernat, Spain still have a golden harvest to bring in. For example, take a snapshot of the penultimate trophy Spain won — not Euro 2012 but Under 21 Euro 2013, beating Italy 4-2. In that final they lined up: David de Gea; Martin Montoya, Inigo Martinez, Marc Bartra, Alberto Moreno; Koke, Thiago, Asier Illarramendi; Cristian Tello, Álvaro Morata, Isco. Juan Bernat (right) played in the Champions League  and is the latest in a string of thriving Spaniards . David de Gea (right) has been in fine form for Manchester United and is a real goalkeeping talent for Spain . Of Spain U21's starting line-up at the 2013 Euros, only De Gea hasn't played UEFA football this season . Of that starting line-up only De Gea hasn't played UEFA football this season, eight of them are still in the Champions League quarter-finals while two of the substitutes, Nacho and Dani Carvajal have decent minutes in the competition. Throw in the fact that Spain's winning Under 21s coach was Julen Lopetegui, 3-1 up on Pep Guardiola's Bayern going into the second leg this week, and the progression from youth-level international football to full-fledged senior winner is going along very nicely. The eight starters and two substitutes from that 4-2 win are all now in the age range of 23 to just having turned 25. Between them they have 184 appearances in UEFA club matches — the vast majority of which are in the Champions League. Koke has played in the Final, Isco, Morata, Carvajal, Nacho and Illarramendi have won it, while Bartra and Thiago have played in a winning campaign. And it is important to throw in the fact that in last week's quarters, 20-year-old Oliver Torres (13 UEFA club matches) stood out against Bayern for Porto (he belongs to Atlético), while on the bench for the Madrid derby were fellow 20-year-olds Jese and Saul Nguez, who have 18 UEFA appearances between them. Spanish fans didn't quite know the great team they were getting in 2008, they could have another one now . Alvaro Morata (right) celebrates with team-mates after scoring against Germany at Euro 2013 in Israel . Whether they flower for club and country or bloom early but fail to excel like recent Spanish generations have proven to do, the fact remains that there is a wave of fresh, exciting Spanish talents who demand attention now. This week in fact. Lopetegui, whose result probably constitutes one of the performances of the season, has a firm view. 'I don't think there's strictly a ""Spanish school"" of coaching or playing,' he argued earlier this season. 'There's just ""training"" and ""playing"". So what I' ve always looked for are kids who know how to understand the game. I think it's a common misconception that players completely understand football and how it's played. Former Under 21 coach Julen Lopetegui has managed Porto to one of the results of the season in midweek . 'Understanding precisely what's going on in a game is not at all easy. 'The key is knowing what to do with the ball so that you don't lose possession and get caught disorganised. Never gift away space to an opponent. 'When you control the ball and space on the pitch, then you must know how to take advantage. But the line is thin, you want to make the players effective and efficient but never to kill off their creativity and capacity for invention.'","When Spain first became a real power, their own fans didn't know at first .

"On Sunday night, at the Stade Velodrome, it’s the Dockers against the Dauphins. The Stevedores against the Stéphanes. Marseille vs Paris Saint-Germain — the hard-nosed, port-city, blue-collar roustabouts against the rich, privileged, capital-city-slickers. Or at least, that’s the way many want it portrayed. The way many in Marseille have always viewed it — and always will. The home side are Ligue 1 top scorers, two points behind the visitors who are leaders and have won seven of France’s last eight Classique matches. Paris Saint-Germain forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic controls the ball during their training session . PSG defender David Luiz, formerly of Chelsea, pictured ahead of their clash with French rivals Marseille . Lucas Moura runs during training as PSG prepare to meet Merseille on Sunday night in Ligue 1 . The fixture between blue-collar Marseille and money-bags PSG guarantees ferocity on Sunday night . Even if the title were not so finely balanced, this fixture guarantees ferocity. Culturally, socially and historically, there is deep enmity. But it is also a contest which pitches Marseille’s ultra-eccentric, ‘is he a fraud/is he a genius?’ coach, Marcelo Bielsa, right where he wants to be. Bear with me, we’ll return to that thought. So obsessive has Bielsa been about football for so long that it has devoured him. The man who took 7,000 videos of matches, goals, players, free-kicks, corners and penalties with him to Japan as coach of Argentina at the 2002 World Cup (his team were knocked out in the first round) has reached a stage whereby no matter how well he instructs, no matter how much sagacity there is in that strange old head of his bursting to get out, the damage inflicted by his relentless intensity makes the experience pyrrhic. However, in fairness, pyrrhic does mean victory — just at too great a cost. Ergo, there has thus far been some success for the man who appointed him — Marseille president Vincent Labrune. Initially, he reckoned: ‘Getting Marcelo, the perfect man for our project, was a huge stroke of luck. ‘I still sometimes ask myself how on earth we managed to get a coach like Bielsa. It’s a bit like signing Lionel Messi for 12 months…’ The sentiment lasted until the Argentine savaged Labrune for his work in the late summer transfer market. Publicly savaged him. With some justification, it must be said. Marseille manager Marcelo Bielsa pictured during a press conference on Friday ahead of the tie . Marseille have not had this many points in Ligue 1 at this stage since winning the title back in 2010 . The two men thrashed out a truce, which has held, in public at least, and that has yielded more of the ‘Ready Brek’ glow which can envelop the early stages of a Bielsa infestation. Marseille have not had this many points at this stage since winning the title back in 2010 — only their second major trophy since 1992. In terms of firepower and value for money, they have scored 21 and 26 goals more than the last two seasons respectively. At the volatile, passionate, but success-starved Velodrome, the fans sing songs about Argentina and chant Bielsa’s name. In a blue-collar city where nobody says ‘please', 'thank you’ or ‘after you’, the paying punter loves to hear stories of the players sweating, hard, for their salaries. Yet the usual problems prevail. Bielsa’s deal is for two years, but a ‘break’ clause is available to either side in June. He won’t even hint whether he’s going or staying. There are leaks that some players are exhausted. Bielsa’s bible says, literally: ‘Running is commitment, running is understanding, running is everything’. At Athletic Bilbao, I know for a fact players still think he made them run through minor injuries, damaging their performances. Javi Martínez, if you got him to tell you the truth, left for Bayern, in part, to get away from the guy. Bielsa’s is the Forrest Gump method. Bielsa pictured during the 2002 World Cup in Japan as Argentina competed in Group F . Bielsa took 7,000 videos of matches, goals, players, free-kicks, corners and penalties with him to Japan . After his first season with the Basques ended in sequential 3-0 defeats in the Europa League and Copa del Rey finals, he tried a ‘But Brutus is an honourable man’ speech on his players. In his 10-minute monologue he repeated his ‘full responsibility’ but basically accused his squad of being cowardly, overpaid, shirkers who had bungled a chance of glory and betrayed the fans. Someone in the dressing room recorded the fork-tongued diatribe and made the audio public. The ultimate betrayal, but caused by disengagement with the Argentine. The plus-side — as with the Athletic team which wowed Europe en route to dismantling Manchester United in 2013 — is that when his fanatical methods impact on his players and temporarily makes them super-fit, his teams can thrill. The down-side is the law of diminishing returns. Something the local media understand far more quickly than anyone else. A couple of weeks ago, after a run of poor results, he lectured them. ‘It’s completely clear that you’ve got it all wrong,’ he accused. ‘In the first part of the season, when we were winning, I was “immense” and the whole of French football should “adopt my methods”. Now you say the opposite. Bielsa’s bible states: ‘Running is commitment, running is understanding, running is everything’ ‘It’s what has happened to me for the last 30 years. In negative moments everyone abandons you. ‘In life we are attracted by what smells good and we flee from what smells bad. Success improves your aroma and defeat gives you an odour. Nobody, nobody, will accompany you to gaining success but everyone will flock to you to share your success once it’s gained.’ The latter part of which shouldn’t, really, have appealed to his players. They won the next match 6-1 at Toulouse. PSG are a different matter. But to return to the original idea, this is where ‘El Loco’ yearns to be. Nelson Vivas recalls that when Bielsa’s Argentina were playing Colombia away, he came in from the warm-up and told them: ‘In a street fight, there are two kinds of guy. The one who strikes, sees blood, is repelled and recoils. Then there’s one who sees blood and goes all-in to finish off the other. Well lads ... I swear I smell blood in the air out there.’ So of what will Bielsa smell on Sunday night? Success? Failure? Blood?","Marseille manager Marcelo Bielsa has previously been nicknamed ‘El Loco’

"There were a lot of potential managers in the Arsenal team that Patrick Vieira captained but he, more than anybody, looked destined to be a top boss. His star quality was obvious from the start. If Manchester City do end up sacking Manuel Pellegrini then there is already one man at the club who would happily take over, if asked. Patrick wants to be a manager. He is intelligent, well-balanced and has a burning desire to win. He was a ferocious competitor on the pitch but off it he is a class act. Patrick Vieira could be next in line to replace Manuel Pellegrini at the Etihad Stadium . City manager Pellegrini faces a nervous wait to see if he keeps his job this summer . (L-R) Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure and James Milner look dejected during the 4-2 Manchester derby defeat . He will feel slightly uncomfortable being linked to the top job. Not because he doesn’t want it but because Pellegrini is still in charge. Patrick has always been respectful. I met him for a tour of City’s new training ground recently and the respect he commands at that club is incredible. He has an aura about him — when he enters a room, people pay attention. At Arsenal, Tony Adams was a very visual captain on the pitch but behind the scenes Patrick always had plenty to say. Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown (right) recently met his former team-mate at City's new training ground . Vieira was a captain who led by example during the pair's time together at Highbury . The World Cup winning Frenchman finished his playing career at Manchester City . Read Sportsmail's verdict on the Manchester derby between United and City . When he took over as captain he would hold team meetings without Arsene Wenger and was never afraid to speak his mind. He is not afraid to take on big personalities — that’s because personalities don’t come much bigger than Patrick’s. He did not shout and scream — he was always calm and spoke with real authority. He never wanted to make rash decisions and is such a solid, reliable character. That’s why he will make a fantastic manager one day. From the first day I met him at Arsenal, Patrick has remained respectful and likeable. Nothing has changed. He is a model professional but he has the personality and presence to take charge in a dressing-room full of big egos. That’s exactly what City need. He has worked with some of the best managers in the business — Arsene Wenger, Fabio Capello, Roberto Mancini and Jose Mourinho. There’s no doubt he will have been studying those men to see how they operate so he can absorb their wisdom and use it to his advantage. But Patrick won’t just try to emulate them, he is very much his own man. Vieira has learned from top managers including Jose Mourinho, Fabio Capello and Arsene Wenger (above) Pep Guardiola stepped up from coaching Barcelona reserves to become the youngest manager to win the Champions League . City did well to identify his talents and get him involved with the youth set-up. But he has not been killing time with the Under 21s. Everything he does is with an eye on one day becoming a manager. Moving from the youth team to a senior side expected to win the title is a big step but Pep Guardiola made the same leap at Barcelona. It can be done. It would be a huge challenge and one that Patrick would relish. It may be that he has to go elsewhere to perfect his craft before returning to City. Either way, Vieira has all the tools needed to succeed in the hot seat.","Manuel Pellegrini's position has come under scrutiny at Manchester City .

"It's Hot or Not time again as Ian Ladyman reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside. Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Steve Davis remain heroic despite their advancing years but what is the point of Formula One? HOT . FC PORTO . Bored of flags on seats? Try capes on seats. The Portuguese club's slaying of Bayern Munich was achieved against a backdrop of fans draped in co-ordinated blue and white. Does this mean that the visitors' lumbering defender Dante became the first footballer ever to 'lose the ball in the background'? Porto's fans were co-ordinated in blue and white as their side stunned Bayern in the Champions League . SHIVNARINE CHANDERPAUL . The West Indies batsman is a throwback to when Test cricket was true to its roots. Slow and boring. But the 40-year-old's longevity is staggering. More than 21 years he has been at it. When he started, Test matches still had rest days. Now that only happens when England play Australia. West Indies' Shivnarine Chanderpaul may be slow and boring but he is still going strong at 40 . STEVE DAVIS . Only the truest sportsmen keep going when nobody else cares. Last week the six-times World snooker champion, now 57, played a qualifying match at a swimming venue in Sheffield. He lost 10-1. There is something mildly heroic about that. I think. Steve Davis failed in his bid to qualify for the World Championships at the age of 57 . MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL. If Match of the Day remains our go-to for weekly football then it now has serious competition. Neville, Carragher and Co have taken analysis to such a level that, on more occasion than one recently, the chat has been a darn sight better than the football. Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville's analysis is often a better watch than the game they're commenting on . NOT . THE GRAND NATIONAL . It remains hypnotic viewing but when winning trainer Oliver Sherwood says: 'I'm just glad the horse came back in one piece' does that not beg a very obvious question? Crabbie's Grand National winner Many Clouds and owner Trevor Hemmings with trainer Oliver Sherwood . FORMULA ONE . Watching a sport where only two or three can win has always struck me as rather pointless. Rather like watching football in Scotland. Now it turns out Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg can't even decide how fast to drive. At least Hunt and Lauda had personalities. Mercedes team-mates Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton have been at loggerheads this season . ALASTAIR COOK . The England skipper has always struck me as a fine batsmen and a poor leader. Now his bad form has continued after tips from Graham Gooch, the man he sacked from the England set-up last year. Are you thinking what I am thinking? Alastair Cook's struggles with the bat have continued in England's first Test against the West Indies . JURGEN KLOPP . Much interest in his decision to leave Borussia Dortmund but Klopp may find his mobile doesn't ring quite as hot from the game's biggest clubs as he thinks. Proof once again that, if you are going to walk then do it when the team is winning.

"I hope when you were sitting at home in front of your tellies  looking forward to the latest instalment of the Arsene vs Jose show that you remembered all important thing: this classic managerial match-up is no capital club sprint, it’s a London derby marathon. And yes, it might well have been entertaining to see the pair - one dressed as a clown, say, and the other a superhero - having it out on the streets while Crammy and Brendan told us some fascinating facts about historical landmarks. Perhaps they can do that next year? This year, instead, once the actual race was run, all roads led to the Emirates and a Sky Sports team all set to act as pacemaker for the afternoon. Arsene Wenger has a look in the direction of Jose Mourinho during the stalemate at the Emirates . And, yes, of course they did bother to point out that there also happened to be an important game of football going on. One with the added factor of Cesc Fabregas happening to be the man in the middle, on a couple of levels. But surely there was never any doubt which two men were going to set the tone for what was about to come. Having just made it sound like some kind of Premier League Mayweather vs Pacquiao match up, in fact both bosses were far from being in a combative mood in their pre match interviews. Jose was nigh on glowing about Arsenal’s ‘creative team (with) amazing, fantastic solutions.’ While Arsene said one of the important motivators for his team was ‘to share positive emotions with our fans.’ It sounded like someone had just broken out the joss sticks in the tunnel. Perhaps a little more in-your-face were the pundits in the booth. Here Thierry ‘as an Arsenal man’ Henry found himself getting mildly bad cop/bad copped by Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness over the former Gunners striker’s contention that ‘it was kind of weird to see (Cesc Fabregas) in a blue shirt’ and that ‘if I was the boss I would tried to buy him back.’ But this really was just everyone jostling for position at the starting gun. The race was yet to be run. In the first half of the encounter, it was the penalty shouts that saw the director scrambling, to switch to Gaffercam. The first image was a beauty, capturing both men together on the touchline after Oscar and Ospina had collided. Oscar and David Ospina collided with the Chelsea man taken to hospital for a suspected concussion . In the foreground, Mourinho dispensed with the pre-game purple prose and was using an entirely different vocabulary to berate the fourth official. While in the distance, Wenger looked on with the benign countenance of a man who perhaps thought he’d got away with one? Each was then given their own live hero shot. Jose was simply stoney-faced for his, by the time the camera had found him after the Fabregas yellow for an adjudged dive. But Arsene’s solo was much more dramatic. A handball shout against Cahill rejected, the Arsenal boss had by now donned one of his famous zip up coats and was captured in glorious slo-mo. His arms raised in the natural position for a man exclaiming ‘how wasn’t that a handball?’ Back in the studio at half time, Thierry looked just as surprised as his old boss had, as he exclaimed ‘Two? Wow!’ when Jamie Carragher said he thought Chelsea had a pair of good shouts from twelve yards. However, not for the first or last time he revealed his true colours when he admitted he thought there had indeed been one for the west London team. ‘I was showing my Arsenal side earlier’, Henry confessed. In his case, proverbially holding his hands up in the box. Jamie Carragher, Thierry Henry and Graeme Souness chew the fat after the final whistle . Into the second half, and on co-commentary Alan Smith made the point very early that Arsenal would be happy ‘in their quest to finish second’. And it became pretty clear pretty quickly that there were in fact two teams out there who’d take one point each. All of which meant the spotlights reserved for any Arsene and Jose fireworks were left dimmed throughout. We didn’t even get any awkward gaffer-on-gaffer action at the final whistle. Instead, just the sight of Mourinho disappearing down the tunnel with the draw tucked away inside his voluminous coat. And John Terry securing the right to be last image in the show with his enthusiastic shadow-boxing celebration. Indeed, by the time Sky had tracked down both managers back in the tunnel, it had reverted to the pre-game chill out zone they had created before kick off. Reporter Patrick Davidson’s attempt to get the Chelsea manager to bite only proved that Jose just wasn’t that hungry. ‘I have no comment’, he continued to reply, his face impassive throughout. Instead, we got a maths lecture on the points position at the top of the table. And a description of John Terry’s performance as ‘from the moon.’ Mourinho patrols the touchline as the Chelsea boss saw his side take another step toward the title . Someone had clearly relit those joss sticks, because Arsene too failed to take the bait when his head to head to Jose was broached. ‘It’s not about me, it’s about my team and my club’, he smiled, before deftly acknowledging an excellent Chelsea side without also paying dues to his opposite number. So in the end, both men effectively breasted the tape together (although they weren’t exactly holding hands in the process), finishing equal first in this particular one. Something Sky Sports spotted early on was the deal, and very wisely chose not to try too hard to shoehorn in melodrama where none existed. And why should they? After all, everyone will be back next year for more of the same. So what’s the rush?","Wenger and Mourinho faced off once more as Arsenal and Chelsea contested a 0-0 draw .

"The official word from Arsenal is that Jack Wilshere is not for sale at the end of the season. Not to Manchester City, not to anyone. Wilshere is one of Arsenal’s own, a product of the fabled Hale End academy and an example to young recruits that it is possible to make a first-team breakthrough. The reality is that Wilshere will sit with his influential father, Andy, at the end of the season to discuss whether a move to City would enhance his career and not just his bank balance. Jack Wilshere takes on Stoke's Charlie Ward during the Arsenal U21s game at the Emirates on Tuesday night . Wilshere was making his first appearance for the Gunners since recovering from ankle surgery . Wilshere has not featured for the first team since he was injured against Manchester United on November 22 . The England midfielder lays on the Old Trafford turf dejected after he suffered an ankle injury . Whatever manager Arsene Wenger has to say before Arsenal’s clash with Burnley on Saturday, Wilshere to Manchester City, as revealed in Sportsmail on Wednesday, is undoubtedly in the works. He is on the list of Txiki Begiristain, City’s director of football. At 23, he is a young English player who could bring down the average age of this City squad — if they could prise him from the Emirates. It will not be easy. Wilshere has always maintained that he wants to remain at Arsenal for the rest of his career. City, though, offer a fresh start and it is possible that Wilshere needs a change of environment after another frustrating season on the sidelines. England manager Roy Hodgson has preferred to deploy Wilshere in a defensive role for the national team . Manchester City have snapped up several players from Arsenal in recent times, with varying degrees of success. GAEL CLICHY . Transfer fee: £7m. Arsenal: 1 Premier League title (2003-04), 1 FA Cup (2005). Man City: 2 Premier League titles (2011-12, 13-14), 1 League Cup (2014). Verdict: Decent deal . KOLO TOURE . Fee: £15m. Arsenal: 1 Premier League title (2003-04), 2 FA Cups (2003, 2005). Man City: 1 Premier League title (2011-12), 1 FA Cup (2011). Verdict: Decent deal . EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR . Fee: £25m. Arsenal honours: none. Man City honours: none. Verdict: bad buy . SAMIR NASRI . Fee: £24m. Arsenal: none. Man City: 2 Premier League titles (2011-12, 2013-14), 1 League Cup (2014). Verdict: top transfer . BACARY SAGNA . Fee: free. Arsenal: 1 FA Cup (2014). Man City: none. Verdict: decent deal . It is also a well-trodden path for Arsenal players in recent seasons, with Emmanuel Adebayor, Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy and Bacary Sagna leaving the rhythmic, first-touch football at the Emirates for super-sized salaries at City. It is not an easy decision, particularly with the vulgar salaries on offer at the Etihad and the inevitable accusations of being a mercenary, but this is key moment in Wilshere’s career. The midfielder is already paid handsomely — £130,000 a week all in when he starts for Arsenal — but injuries are a constant source of frustration for Wilshere. He has not played a first-team game for Arsenal since November 22, when he was substituted 55 minutes into the 2-1 defeat by Manchester United at the Emirates with an ankle injury. In the past, Wilshere has been built up too soon, championed as a future Arsenal and England captain when he has yet to even make 100 starts for his club in the Barclays Premier League. Even former England captain Steven Gerrard claimed he had the ability to become one of the best midfielders in the world before he played Brazil at Wembley in February 2013. ‘Jack’s got a bit of everything. He can tackle, pass, get up and down the pitch, create a goal or score a goal,’ said Gerrard at the time. ‘He ticks almost every box, and he’s going to get better and better. He has the potential to become one of the best in the world. ‘I don’t want to put any pressure on him, but having played against him and seen him in training, he’s a one-off. He’s a lot better than your normal Premier League midfielder.’ The truth is that Wilshere needs time, room to breathe again after being championed ever since he scored that magnificent goal for Arsenal’s reserve team against West Ham at Barnet’s Underhill Stadium in 2008. Wenger was there that night, grinning with approval in the stands after the 16-year-old’s curling left-foot effort confirmed his status as one of the club’s rising stars. He earned instant comparison to Liam Brady. Gael Clichy (left) and Samir Nasri are just two Gunners who have left for Manchester City in recent seasons . Arsene Wenger's side are currently second in the Premier League and face Burnley on Saturday . Since then Wilshere has made the grade with the first team, an established member of a core group of players who are enjoying the club’s soothing possession football. On present form Arsenal are the best team to watch in the Premier League and Wilshere, recovering from his latest injury, would dearly love to be part of it. Although dad Andy is a West Ham fan, his son is Arsenal through and through, as he demonstrated after last season’s dramatic victory over Hull City in the FA Cup. During the victory parade, just hours before he joined up with the England squad to begin preparations for the World Cup in Brazil, he mischievously grabbed the microphone to ask the fans: ‘What do you think of Tottenham?’ The answer was well-publicised at the time, but the more pertinent question is whether Wilshere can reclaim his first place in this developing Arsenal team. Wilshere could struggle to break into a side containing Alexis Sanchez (left) and Mesut Ozil next season . With England, manager Roy Hodgson plays him at the base of his midfield diamond, but at Arsenal Wenger prefers him in a pairing behind the main attackers. With Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey the favoured attacking players behind Olivier Giroud, this is not an easy team for Wilshere to get into next season. At 23 he has time on his side and even at the end of this season there are still three years to run on his current contract. Soon enough there will be a decision to be made for all concerned.","Jack Wilshere has been linked with a move to Manchester City this summer .

"It was just after breakfast, only a few short hours after the rampant champagne-fuelled celebrations into the early morning had ended, but Carlo Ancelotti knew exactly what he was saying. Still in Madrid’s five-star Tivoli Lisboa hotel, the ‘fat boy with the bowl full of Emilian tortellini’ (his own words, not mine) told an Italian journalist friend: ‘Yes we’ve made history by winning La Decima — but this is Real Madrid. Lose two games next season and I’ll still be an “idiot”.’ Date: May 25, 2014. Hotel Address: Liberty Street, Lisbon. And of course Ancelotti was speaking after Madrid’s two principal teams, sworn enemies, had contested the Champions League Final and he had lifted the ‘cup with the big ears’ for the fifth time as player or coach. Carlo Ancelotti is starting to feel the strain after recent poor results at Real Madrid . Ancelotti was a hero after guiding Real Madrid to their 10th European Cup triumph last year . Gareth Bale celebrates after scoring Real's second goal in extra time during the Lisbon final . Cristiano Ronaldo scored his team's fourth late in extra time to secure the famous victory . August 19 - Real 1-1 Atletico . Supercopa, First Leg . August 22 - Atletico 1-0 Real . Supercopa, Second Leg . September 13 - Real 1-2 Atletico . La Liga . January 7 - Atletico 2-0 Real . Copa del Rey Last 16, First Leg . January 15 - Real 2-2 Atletico . Copa del Rey Last 16, Second Leg . February 7 - Atletico 4-0 Real . La Liga . Not that winning liberated him from the sad truth of his statement. Two games? His team have lost almost one out of every three matches in 2015 (six defeats in 19 outings). Worse is the fact that he is now a black smudge on Madrid’s pristine-white history, having already lost to Atletico — the club which was unable to register a single win over Real between 1999 and 2013 — four times in a season. Perhaps worst of all, the European champions’ utterly humiliating 4-0 defeat at the ferocious Calderon stadium last time these two met, just over two months ago, meant Atletico had won all three home ‘derbis’ by a 7-0 aggregate this term. In fact, during each of the seven defeats in 11 derbies Ancelotti has had to soak up as Madrid manager against Diego Simeone’s bruising buccaneers, his team hasn’t scored once. None of which make Ancelotti an idiot. Where they do, cumulatively, leave him is in perhaps the most embarrassing position of his career. Not because if he loses the imminent Champions League quarter-final against Spain’s champions Ancelotti fears the sack. Cristiano Ronaldo sits dejected during Real's 4-0 La Liga defeat to Atletico back in February . Mario Mandzukic (left) celebrates with Fernando Torres after scoring in Atletico's 4-0 win in February . Like Norman Stanley Fletcher in Porridge, there are some penalties in his chosen profession which ‘Carletto’ (Wee Charlie) treats as an occupational hazard. You might argue that losing a 3-0 lead over Liverpool in Istanbul almost exactly a decade ago should constitute that moment of maximum embarrassment. Not so. Ancelotti not only famously doled out revenge on Rafa Benitez’s team two years later — when Milan reached the 2007 final they watched the Liverpool v Chelsea second semi-final together, cheering and roaring for the Reds more hoarsely than any Koppite to go through so that history could be re-visited — he could also come to terms with the remarkable 3-3-and-penalties defeat. His view: ‘My team did its very best to win. So I couldn’t be angry. I think this was destiny. I’ve managed nearly 900 matches in my career and two where my team played exceptionally well were that Istanbul final and the semi against Manchester United in 2007.’ So this is a different red-and-white thorn in his side. Constant defeats during which Real Madrid have not, by any stretch, done their best. Things have, in fact, been getting incrementally worse. May’s final in Lisbon was won the very second that Sergio Ramos made it 1-1 in the 93rd minute. Atletico were, almost literally, out on their feet. A rueful Ancelotti walks past the European Cup after Milan surrendered a three-goal lead against Liverpool . But Ancelotti made up for it by beating Liverpool in 2007 and gaining revenge for that defeat two years before . AC MILAN . UEFA Champions League 2002-03, 2006-07 . UEFA Super Cup 2003, 2007 .

Ligue 1 2012-13 . REAL MADRID . UEFA Champions League 2013-14 . UEFA Super Cup 2014 . FIFA Club World Cup 2014 . Copa del Rey 2013-14 . Since then, it has been as if Simeone and Co have soaked up all the anger, all the humiliation, all the impotent rage they felt when Cristiano Ronaldo venerated his penalty goal (to kill an already dead match) for 4-1 with his ‘I’m actually the Incredible Hulk’ celebration. In the drama of that night, and amidst the history of Madrid’s tenth title, it's often forgotten that when Rafa Varane kicked the ball at Atletico’s Argentinian manager with two minutes left in extra-time, Simeone chased him onto the pitch then had to be both restrained and persuaded to leave the playing surface before being sent off. Simeone, applauded out of the press conference later that night in appreciation of having won the Spanish title and of how heroically Atletico clung on to Diego Godin’s headed lead in Lisbon, spoke kindly about Varane being ‘just a kid’ with ‘a great future’ in the post-match post-mortem. But, trust me, that was one of the spurs chafing at Simeone’s skin all summer until the Spanish Supercup second leg when Varane was pressed, exposed for awareness and sharpness and Mario Mandzukic bagged the goal which started Atletico’s winning run against Madrid this season. ‘The most important, most intelligent player in every great team is usually a midfielder,’ Ancelotti believes. Atletico manager Diego Simeone rushes on to confront Real defender Rafael Varane in the final . Simeone also had a go at referee Bjorn Kuipers as tempers boiled over during the last few minutes . Atletico were unable to hang on to the lead given to them by Diego Godin during the Lisbon final . He was one such, as was Simeone, plus Luis Enrique, Pep Guardiola (and Max Allegri at a far lower level) at four of the other eight Champions League quarter- finalists. However, as a coach, Carletto couldn’t be more different from the breed represented by Simeone, ‘Lucho’ and Guardiola. And that’s something else, other than Ancelotti’s future employment with Madrid, which is at stake this week. From the moment when elite footballers, and then run-of-the-mill players, began to earn money per season which made them absolutely financially secure for life, the worth of the coach who is only authoritarian was at an end. If you can’t ‘convince’ and ‘enlist’ your multi-millionaire squad at a club which is expected to win one, or more, of the great trophies each season, then you are dead in the water. But Guardiola, Mourinho and Simeone come from a school where they not only master the teaching, coaxing, convincing, but show ferocious authoritarian tendencies, too. ‘My way or the high way’ is something they not only dare to say to a player worth £50m-plus, they believe it’s their right. Ancelotti is built differently, having won 17 trophies as a coach seeking only intelligence, diligence and intensity of effort. He neither wants nor needs to instil fear, to make his players blind followers of a regimental doctrine — he actually treats them as responsible grown-ups. If his team act like novice kids at the Calderon on Tuesday, once again, then Ancelotti still won’t be an idiot. But an endangered species — yes.","Real Madrid have not beaten their neighbours in six meetings this season .

"There is a passage in Diego Torres’s book, 'The Special One - The Secret World of Jose Mourinho', which goes a long way to understanding the practices of Chelsea’s manager. In the English version of Torres’s biography, the exchanges between Mourinho and Cristiano Ronaldo in the dressing room at Real Madrid start on page 138 and finish five pages later. Here is an abridged version of the alleged events in the team meeting before the second leg of the 2011 Champions League semi-final against Barcelona, when Ronaldo had made it clear he expected Los Blancos to be more adventurous in the Bernabeu. Jose Mourinho makes a point to Oscar and his Brazilian team-mate Willian during a game at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho has been called out by players for being too defensive before, by Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid . Oscar holds his head in his hands after missing a good chance at Stoke, where he was replaced at half time . Oscar hasn't completed a full 90 minutes for Chelsea since mid-January. Here is is full recent record: . Jan 31 Manchester City (substituted, 89) Feb 7 Aston Villa (substituted, 73) Feb 11 Everton (unused) Feb 17 Paris Saint Germain (substitute, 83) Feb 21 Burnley (substituted, 72) Mar 1 Tottenham (substitute, 88) Mar 4 West Ham (substituted, 74) Mar 11 Paris Saint Germain (substituted, 45) Mar 15 Southampton (substituted, 82) Mar 22 Hull (substitute, 61) Apr 4 Stoke (substituted, 45) According to Torres, the Real Madrid coach told his star player: ‘I’m going to say it to your face: you complain that we play defensively. But do you know why we play this way? For you. ‘Because, as you don’t want to defend or cover the wings, I have to have the team sitting deep... when you come on, you do your own thing.’ That meeting, held in the presence of the great Zinedine Zidane, apparently lasted 40 minutes. Real Madrid drew the second leg 1-1 and Barcelona progressed to the final, where they beat Manchester United 3-1 at Wembley. Team meetings are a theme of Mourinho’s management, giving his players the floor during the fallow periods that inevitably occur during the course of a long season. It is a pragmatic approach, one to be admired, unless you happen to be one of the players who challenges Mourinho’s coaching philosophy. You cannot blame Oscar, the current fall-guy, for encouraging Chelsea to play with a sense of adventure at a team meeting that took place during their wobble at the end of January. When you can call upon Oscar, Eden Hazard and Willian, why wouldn’t you? Oscar has been put back in his box in recent weeks, failing to start or finish a full 90 minutes in all competitions for Chelsea since the 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg on January 27. The Brazilian midfielder has failed to complete 90 minutes in any of Chelsea's last 11 games . Mourinho demands that the likes of Oscar work hard on their defensive roles to free Eden Hazard's flair . The Brazilian forward has not completed a Barclays Premier League match since the 5-0 victory at Swansea City, where he scored twice for the league leaders, 10 days earlier. Oscar put Chelsea ahead in the opening minute at the Liberty Stadium and his second, when he beat Swansea keeper Lukas Fabianski in the 36th minute from the edge of the area, is the last time he has scored. Since the 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the Capital One Cup at Stamford Bridge, Oscar has been substituted or been named substitute in 10 of Chelsea’s last 11 fixtures. Here is the record in full. Manchester City (substituted, 89); Aston Villa (substituted, 73); Paris Saint-Germain (substitute, 83); Burnley (substituted, 72); Tottenham (substitute, 88); West Ham (substituted, 74); Paris Saint-Germain (substituted, 45); Southampton (substituted, 82); Hull (substitute, 61); Stoke (substituted, 45). Against Everton, on February 11, he was not in the squad. Naturally Oscar has some concerns, worried that his views at a routine team meeting have been misinterpreted by this most demanding of managers. Oscar was disappointing during last weekend's win, and Mourinho hit out at his performance afterwards . The Chelsea star tries a fancy flick but little of what he tried came off during the win against Stoke . It is believed to have been innocuous, an observation from a player who has been a popular and respectful member of the Chelsea dressing room since his move from Internacional in 2012. He is certainly not regarded as a troublemaker. It was Oscar, after all, who is so highly-regarded by the coaching staff at Chelsea that he was considered a potential, future rival to the annual duel between Lionel Messi and Ronaldo for the Ballon d’Or. When Oscar returned from the World Cup, where he scored the 90th minute goal for his country in their 7-1 rout by Germany in the semi-final, his first-class attitude to the new season was noted by coaching staff. Despite the disappointment over the summer with the national team, he was eager to please Mourinho as he entered his third season with Chelsea. In November, his sparkling form was rewarded with a new five-year contract, a move designed to keep him in that role off the main striker, Diego Costa, until 2019. All was well. Oscar was dejected after Brazil's World Cup semi final defeat, but he returned to Chelsea with a good attitude . The Chelsea midfielder suggested the side should be more positive with the likes of Eden Hazard and Willian . When Oscar arrived at the club he was thought of as a future Ballon d'Or winner, but his place is now in doubt . There is a touch of Brian Clough about Mourinho’s attitude towards him, a nod in the direction of the famous response he gave when asked about the way he dealt with disaffected players. ‘We talk about it for 20 minutes and then we decide I was right all along,’ Clough once remarked. Oscar is certainly learning all about that as he deals with Mourinho’s mood swings. ‘No, I don’t think he had a bad performance, I just think his performance was not good enough, which is a huge difference,’ claimed Chelsea’s manager after their 2-1 victory over Stoke City on Saturday. Naturally there is a little uncertainty about Oscar’s performances at the moment, reluctant to try anything out of the ordinary because of the potential consequences. Oscar knows, like everyone else knows, that if you take on Mourinho, he will take you off.","Oscar spoke up against defensive Chelsea tactics in a team meeting .

"‘Everybody loves Harry’ exclaimed a disgruntled Ian Wright, at the very thought of anything to the contrary. ‘What you on about?’ Alongside Wrighty, Steve McManaman also defended his honour. ‘He’s been hugging everybody’, laughed Macca. All of this because Jake Humphrey teasingly suggested to Harry Redknapp he was in ‘hostile territory’ as BT Sport brought us the lunchtime game from the Emirates between Arsenal and Liverpool. Not since his aching knees took him away from the touchline have we seen Harry pitch side at a Premier League ground. Well, that break seemed to have done him the power of good as the former Tottenham gaffer chuckled at Jake’s notion. ‘Not easy’, he smiled. ‘But so far so good’. Harry Redknapp joined BT Sport presenter Jake Humphrey for live broadcast of Arsenal vs Liverpool . And it was indeed good to see Redknapp back in the role of pundit at a live game. His joints may be letting him down at the moment, but his wit and football nous seems to have remained undiminished as he joined in with the conversations that surrounded this crucial, and topical game. Coming into the match, Raheem Sterling had almost single-handedly managed to nearly shift the emphasis away from who would get the points to how many pounds he might get. And Harry had a view on both aspects. First he addressed Sterling’s contribution on the pitch, saying Liverpool had ‘got away with it to a point’ in playing him in recent games at wing back. But added that in this one ‘he needs to play that free role’. Redknapp was in fine form as pundit for Saturday's Premier League encounter at the Emirates . While on the young player’s future at the the club, for Harry there was only one position. ‘I think he needs to sign his contract. Get on with his football.’ Wright and Macca were in totally agreement, stating in tandem ‘he does’ when asked if they thought he wanted to play his football at Liverpool? When it came to a discussion on the title race, Harry was once again unswerving in his opinion. And you knew he was making a serious point because he was willing to back it with money against Wright. ‘We’ll have a tenner’, he suggested to the laughing former Arsenal hero. ‘I’ll have Chelsea. You’ve got the Gunners.’ During the first half, a definite winner was commentator Ian Darke who had one of those moments all the men behind the lip mics dream of. ‘Interesting, before the match we saw Mesut Ozil practise exactly this kind of free kick’, he told us as the German stood over the ball. The fact that just a few seconds later the same ball was now nestled in the back of Liverpool’s net allowed Darke a well earned denouement. ‘It’s Ozil. And it’s in. Practise makes perfect’. Ian Wrighty and Steve McManaman were quick to defend former Tottenham boss Redknapp . The presentation team were now in the studio at the break. Harry giving them knees a rest in the comfy chairs. And from where he was sitting he might just have been able to see the copy of his book placed strategically in shot just behind Humphrey. So Harry was relaxed, but he wasn’t resting on his laurels. When it became clear Daniel Sturridge was going to be coming on for the second half, Redknapp was quick to question Brendan Rodgers decision-making regarding the player. ‘What’s he supposed to be, Superman? Turn it around’, was Redknapps reaction. And he added, ‘If he’s fit enough to come on now, why wasn’t he fit enough to start the game?’ As we know, Daniel had failed to wear his red underpants outside his shorts and the game was lost. Leaving a disgruntled Brendan Rodgers to put a brave face on it in his post-match chat. At this moment, had there been anything hanging in the studio air regarding Redknapp’s future in football management, he managed to snuff that thought out most effectively. Arsenal beat Liverpool 4-1 in the Premier League clash at the Emirates on Saturday . Picking up on Rodgers’ pain straight away, Harry told us, shifting uncomfortably in that comfy chair, ‘that’s the most difficult thing, to stand there and smile. You can’t believe how low you go. It’s scary at times. It’s how it gets you’, he continued before reflecting, ‘when it stops (itals) getting you like that, that is the time to pack it up. Perhaps that’s why I packed it up!’. That little punchline punctured the gloom and brought the house down. It was the perfect moment to put to rest any suggestion that Harry Redknapp had departed from the game he clearly still loves. Perhaps those old knees will stop him stalking the space in front of his team’s dug out? But it is unlikely to stop him from talking on the screens in front of us where I reckon he always was and clearly remains, great value. Even at an even tenner.","Harry Redknapp made his pitchside return at Arsenal vs Liverpool .

"Over the years I’ve been lucky enough to play with a lot of accomplished women golfers, including two former world No 1's in Lorena Ochoa and Laura Davies. But none of these encounters prepared me for playing 18 holes with Charley Hull, the best teenage golfer in Britain. Suffice to say: I knew she was good but I didn’t appreciate she was so damn good. The venue was Turnberry and a media day for the Ricoh Women’s British Open in July. The sun was shining, Ailsa Craig was shimmering in the distance and Hull put on a shot-making clinic. Charley Hull can make it to the very top of the women's game if she carries on her progression . Teenager Hull possesses the same ‘wow’ factor as world No 1 Rory McIlroy (below) One of the nice things for me about playing golf with the women pros is we usually hit the ball about the same length. Not on this day. Hull hit drives that pitched past mine. She positively exudes the ‘wow’ factor Rory McIlroy had at the same age. Like Rory, she’s also easy company. Normally the way these things work is for the journalist to kick start conversations but Hull asked more questions than I did. She wanted to know everything about the course, from the historic role of the celebrated lighthouse to the war memorial that offers sober reflection to golfers on the back nine. The 19-year-old was keen to know about the revamp planned by the Trump family, who recently purchased Turnberry, under the guidance of course architect Martin Ebert. Again, like Rory, there’s the requisite amount of steel. ‘I’d hit a five iron off this tee to stay short of the bunkers,’ advised her caddy Gary Wildman, on the opening hole. ‘No, I want to hit a driver,’ replied Hull. She hit a driver. Indeed, she hit a driver off every tee, which is the way she likes to do things in practice. ‘I just find taking on the holes makes me concentrate,’ she explained. Again, like Rory, the driver also happens to be the best club in her bag. The 19-year-old has the same mentality and 'wow factor' as world No 1 Rory McIlroy . It puts her in the vanguard of the next revolution set to sweep the women’s game. After the emergence of the Koreans and the revival of the Americans, get set for the power hitters to leave their mark in the same way their male counterparts hold sway in the men’s version. Hull is part of a group that includes Thai rookie Ariya Jutanugarn and American Lexi Thompson. Hull has added 25 yards to her drive since hooking up with swing coach Matt Belsham earlier this year. Again, like McIlroy — there could be a theme here — her swing is so good she uses blade irons (she might be the only woman to do so), which are the preserve of the technically sound. American Lexi Thompson is another highly-touted golfer in women's golf and will challenge Hull . What’s next for the girl from Kettering who plays at Woburn and who finished No 1 in Europe last year, the youngest to do so? She has now earned her privileges to play in America and clearly that is the next proving ground. Her plan is to be the best player in the world at 21 — the year McIlroy reached the summit — which might be a tall order given the present incumbent happens to be 13 months younger and won yet again in America on Sunday. Hull speaks in respectful tones about Lydia Ko. They played together in New Zealand recently, where the home favourite shot a course-record 61 to Hull’s 64. ‘It was just an amazing day, and I hope we have many more,’ said Hull. Hull has ambitions to be the best in the world and she has a good chance of doing just that . The great advantage she will have over Ko going forward is the fact she hits the ball significantly further. But will she hole enough putts to make it count? On this day, she holed nothing of any length and still breezed round the Ailsa Course in 68 strokes. Hull recalled the last time she played Turnberry, in the Health Perception Championship. She was nine at the time, and stood 4ft 7in tall. ‘This was where I got knocked over by the wind,’ she said, standing on the 11th tee. How typical that she got back up to win the event. A decade on, she’ll take some knocking over this July… and beyond.","British golfer Charley Hull has all the attributes to be one of the best .

"In telly terms, the FA Cup has had quite - what they like to call in the trade - a 'journey’ this season. This weekend saw its TV channel sidekicks deliver a double header with a new ally to help set the scene. This no doubt will have the purists, and perhaps even some fans of the four teams involved, spitting at the very mention. But with Wembley on board for both games, I doubt the BBC and BT Sport will have minded presenting their coverage from HQ. However, on Saturday evening, Ian Wright was dead sheepish about it in the BBC’s on-site studio. ‘I don’t like semi finals at Wembley’, said Wrighty squirming awkwardly in his seat at the prospect of it. Well, some twenty four hour or so later, Wembley was certainly delighted to host them. Arsenal players celebrate during the victory over Reading which saw the Gunners reach the FA Cup final . Fabian Delph (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against Liverpool at Wembley . Wembley Stadium was a great setting for this weekend's two FA Cup semi-final clashes . Prior to that first clash on Saturday between Arsenal and Reading, there had also been disgruntled talk from inside the Emirates Stadium. This time about the fact the match clashed with the big Premier league game between Chelsea and Manchester United. Yes, over on Sky Sports, you could have witnessed business as usual at Stamford Bridge. With a first half that Jamie Redknapp at one point described as ‘difficult to watch’. If you weren’t watching Chelsea's victory, what you could see instead was what turned out to be a genuine sporting event, a real footballing occasion. Alongside Wright, the extremely engaging Jason Roberts hoped his old club Reading wouldn’t treat their premature trip to north west London as ‘a day out' and believed there was a chance the Royals could win against Arsenal. Well, they most certainly set aside the chance for some selfies and instead contributed wholly to a cracking game of football. A clash that was bursting out of the telly screen with atmosphere as the sun soaked some thrilling football and the crowd generated a groundswell of excitement. Reading, pictured celebrating after Garath McCleary's goal, contributed to a great encounter on Saturday . What’s more, there were also a couple of errors that led to two memorable moments in the coverage. Firstly, when a film about the infamous 1990 FA Cup Semi Finals failed, Gary Lineker was left with a spare few minutes to fill. Which he did with a great chat about his guests' Cup Final Wembley memories. ‘It’s a wonderful experience, winning an FA Cup, isn’t it Wrighty?’, observed Lineker before turning to the distinctly pot free Alan Shearer. ‘Don’t start again, Gary!’, barked Al, his brief annoyance serving only to make the moment even funnier for his fellow ex pros. And then there was Reading’s Adam Federici. I was amazed at the end of the game when the director went through the familiar montage of close ups, and while doing so chose to cut away from manager Steve Clarke beginning to console his crestfallen keeper. A few minutes later, they did decide to show it, though. I almost wished they hadn’t as it was nearly too harrowing to watch the poor fella’s suffering. Nevertheless it was compelling stuff, and helped seal that first semi final as something a bit special. Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici (centre) is consoled by Royals boss Steve Clarke after the final whistle . Come Sunday, and the man who would be drawing the camera’s unblinking gaze was this time established right from the get go. As soon as Steven Gerrard was announced in the starting line up, there was no doubt which player was going to be at the heart of BT Sport’s story. Although it wasn’t  all about the outgoing captain. They opened their coverage with a lovely little film in which two young fans - Villa’s Tom and Liverpool’s John-Paul (naturally!) - recreated each team’s cup runs in their back gardens. We then saw the two young stars walking up Wembley way together, helping to remind us about the supporter’s part in the occasion. This was reiterated with a pre-match lap of the pitch by host Jake Humphrey and his pundits which really drew those of us at home into the moment. It also enabled us to hear the Villa fans give Robbie Savage a, shall we say, robust welcome as he approached their end! Former Birmingham City midfielder Robbie Savage (right) received a robust welcome from the Villa faithful . From the moment we first saw Stevie G trotting out onto the pitch to warm up, right up until the moment  commentator Ian Darke exclaimed ‘off the line, Gerrard’s header’, the outgoing skipper was very rarely far from the centre of attention. Come the final whistle, the Liverpool captain was clearly reluctant to be. It was something BT handled very cleverly by using their inset box innovation to show the on pitch interview with Man of the Match Fabian Delph as the main shot showed Gerrard sullenly leaving the Wembley turf for possibly the last time. Yet another moment that made Wembley the ideal setting for an FA Cup semi-final TV audience to enjoy even more magic from this season’s tournament? I’ll leave that thought with you. Much of the attention was on Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard during Sunday's semi-final clash on BT Sport .","Wembley hosted two FA Cup semi-finals over the weekend .

"One can only imagine the gloomy mood that must have collectively descended on the European Tour's headquarters at Wentworth last week when reading about the acts of selflessness of the new Masters champion, Jordan Spieth. Shortly after being presented with the green jacket, the man who has rapidly become everyone's favourite Texan flew to New York and gave 25 interviews over the course of 24 hours. Then, despite the obvious fatigue, he flew to South Carolina to keep his promise to play the Heritage tournament — his fourth event in a row — because, well, they were good to him on the way up and he wanted to pay them back. Jordan Spieth hits a tee shot on the eighth hole during the final round of the RBC Heritage Tournament . Spieth has competed in four events in a row as the new Masters champion shows his commitment to the sport . There was more. What about two tournaments coming up next month in his home state? Yes, I'll be playing because they're 'hometown events', he said. He also committed to the Cadillac Match Play Championship in San Francisco next week because it is a WGC event, and the Players Championship in Florida the following week because it is the tour's flagship competition. Now, by way of stark contrast, let's return to the European Tour and their flagship event, also being played next month when the BMW PGA Championship is staged at Wentworth. Given that Europeans won an unprecedented three majors last year plus the Ryder Cup, not surprisingly they wanted to put on quite a celebration. Spieth attends the 50th Academy Of Country Music Awards at the AT&T Stadium on Sunday night . The new Masters champion poses with singers Charles Kelley (centre) and Jake Owen (left) on Sunday night . Only trouble is, three of the high-profile members of that winning team at Gleneagles will not be present. Local favourite Ian Poulter, world No 3 Henrik Stenson and world No 10 Sergio Garcia have decided not to play. In the past all three have made no secret of the fact they don't care for Wentworth and all three have poor records in the event. Doesn't that make it an obvious event to cut from a busy schedule? You can see the argument. But, equally, as Spieth at the age of just 21 is effortlessly showing, sometimes it's simply about doing the right thing. Yes, Poulter and Stenson, in particular, can put forward persuasive cases as to how they do their bit for European golf. Poulter is doing plenty behind the scenes to ensure the relaunched British Masters at Woburn in October will be a great success; Stenson plays more tournaments round the world than any other top player and the nasty bout of flu that ruined his chance at the Masters was a sure sign he needs to cut back. All the same, the feeling lingers this admirable pair have got this one wrong. BMW have done a fabulous job with this tournament. It has grown to become an integral part of London's sporting summer. Ian Poulter watches his second shot on the first hole during the final round of the RBC Heritage Tournament . 'It may be my last Masters next year. The distance is ebbing away from this old body and the handwriting is on the wall.’ Not just his final Open this summer, but it looks as if 65-year-old Tom Watson is ready to call it a day at Augusta as well. This year he shot 71 in the first round to become the oldest player to break par in Masters history. He followed it by making the halfway cut in the Heritage tournament in South Carolina last week, and shooting 69 in the third round. Clearly, he’s determined to go out with head unbowed. The prize fund at €5million is handsome and the players are treated regally, with a top-class players' lounge and free accommodation thrown in at the five-star Coworth Park hotel in Ascot. Equally, they don't do this as an act of benevolence. They do this on the presumption that everyone will turn up. So imagine how they must be feeling. Yes, it will still be a great event with world No 1 Rory McIlroy and Masters runner-up Justin Rose competing, while American Patrick Reed is making his debut. But they could be forgiven for looking at the revived Irish Open the following week featuring just as many star names for less than half of their investment and taking place on one of the world's great golf courses in Royal County Down to boot, and questioning their largesse. Pleasing all tournament sponsors is, of course, an impossible task, even if Spieth appears determined to try. But there are some events where players ought to feel an obligation to play. Their own flagship event is surely one. Sweden's Henrik Stenson watches his tee shot on the fourth hole during the RBC Heritage Tournament . St Andrews will be Nick Faldo's last Open . Twenty-five years after his runaway victory at St Andrews, Sir Nick Faldo will play in his last Open at the Home of Golf this July. Thus, the greatest British player of the modern era will bow out over the Swilcan Bridge like so many of the American legends, such as Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. With innovative new grandstands dramatically increasing the capacity around the fabled 17th and 18th holes, it will be a fitting place to say goodbye in every sense. ‘I look forward to celebrating all that golf has given me as I cross that storied bridge,’ said Sir Nick, whose 58th birthday falls on the Saturday of the event. Legendary golfer Nick Faldo is set to make his final Open appearance at St Andrews in July when he turns 58 .","Shortly after being presented with his green jacket, new Masters champion Jordan Spieth gave 25 interviews over the course of 24 hours in New York .

"Read Madrid galactico Gareth Bale will be the subject of a three-way £75million transfer battle between Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City this summer. Bale has indicated, publicly at least, that he wants to stay at Real. But sources in Spain suggest that the club could be willing to offload him even though manager Carlo Ancelotti has said he wants the winger to remain at the club. Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale is a  transfer target for Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City . Bale could be sold by Real Madrid as they pursue a deal for Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus . The complex politics at Madrid mean that Bale could be traded to help finance the inevitable signing of at least one platinum player during the summer and work within the parameters of Financial Fair Play. Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus is one star being lined up, and Madrid may feel they need to find space for Isco in their first team, the player having recently expressed his frustration at being sidelined for much of the season. Reus only recently signed a new four-year deal with Dortmund. But it is understood that was more to optimise his transfer value. Under the terms of his previous contract Reus had a buy-out clause of £20m. That has been written out of the new deal and the Bundesliga club believe he is worth double that in the current market. When Bale signed his record £86m deal to join Real Madrid from Tottenham two years ago he had a £75m release clause written in. Dortmund rate Reus (right) at around £40million after his £20m buy-out clause was taken out of his new deal . Bale has said he wants to stay at Real Madrid despite becoming unpopular with some fans this season . As it stands Chelsea would seem favourites to buy Bale, and the Blues also want Real centre half Raphael Varane. But City and United will be in the mix too as they both seek to bolster their attacking power. Ultimately it will come down to which club tables the best deal should Real open the door. The fact Bale has become unpopular with a section of the Bernabeu despite having a decent season could prove a deciding factor. A few weeks ago it seemed Javier Hernandez seemed destined to return to the Premier League this summer at the end of his year-long loan at Real Madrid came to an end. West Ham, Tottenham and Southampton were all in the hunt for the Manchester United striker who can be bought from United for £7m. But suddenly Madrid could decide to buy Hernandez themselves. Chelsea appear most likely to sign Bale - and they also want his Real Madrid team-mate Raphael Varane (right) Real Madrid could look to make Javier Hernandez's loan move a permanent one after his goal against Atletico . It might have been a simple finish served up by Cristiano Ronaldo, but the late winner Hernandez scored to beat city rivals Atletico Madrid in their Champions League quarter-final has lifted the striker to legendary status. The Bernabeu fans saluted Hernandez with astonishing continual chanting of the player's nickname 'Chicarito' until he eventually left the pitch. Not even Ronaldo has enjoyed such adulation. The Real hierarchy may find it unacceptable to let Hernandez go now. And if the player becomes more regular there is the added commercial factor of his shirt sales in his native Mexico. If Hernandez is retained that would be another reason why the club would be ready to move on Bale. Petr Cech could get a dream move to Real Madrid if David de Gea rejects the Spanish giants and signs a new £200,000-a-week deal with Manchester United. Cech is set to leave Chelsea in a £10m move this summer. Liverpool want him but a move to Madrid could be on if the La Liga side don't move for Tottenham's Hugo Lloris, who would cost £25m. Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech could join Real Madrid this summer if David de Gea stays at Manchester United . Aston Villa will come under pressure to sell striker Christian Benteke this summer if bids pass £30m. Liverpool may make a move even if they sign Danny Ings, with the future of Daniel Sturridge suddenly uncertain. Mario Balotelli's place in the squad will also have to be filled but it's unclear which club will be willing to sign Balotelli given his six-figure weekly wages. The Reds seem certain to take Benteke's Belgium international team mate Divock Origi back from his year-long loan with Lille. Rickie Lambert could be part of the deal with Villa, and will be on the wanted list of several other Premier League clubs. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke could be sold by the club if they receive a bid of over £30m this summer . Middlesbrough are set to give Jonathan Woodgate a new one-year deal next season, and if the club get promoted it would mark a remarkable return to the Premier League for the former England centre half. Woodgate's top-flight career seemed over two years ago when he left Stoke after the problems he has had with injury. But at the age of 35 Woodgate has been a constant force in Boro's promotion drive this season. Veteran defender Jonathan Woodgate (left) is set to earn a new one-year contract at Middlesbrough . QPR striker Charlie Austin will be a target for West Ham and Newcastle this summer. Monaco may move for Emmanuel Adebayor, who will be released by Tottenham at the end of the season. Inter Milan president Erick Thohir admitted to an Italian newspaper that the club want Manchester City's Yaya Toure. 'We like him and we are sure Roberto Mancini will know how to make the most of his talents,' Thohir told Corriere della Sera. Inter Milan president Erick Thohir has admitted that the club want to sign Manchester City's Yaya Toure (left) I am hearing . Sam Allardyce will consider the option of managing abroad next season. I understand Allardyce is virtually resigned to not being offered a new contract by West Ham next season when his current deal expires in the summer. Allardyce has long been frustrated that he has been pigeonholed as a 'belts and braces' manager when he believes he is a far more sophisticated coach than he is given credit for and has been at the vanguard of sports science innovation in the game. Indeed he once claimed that had been foreign with a name like 'Allardici' then he would get more plaudits and bigger jobs. West Ham boss Sam Allardyce is considering managing abroad next season if he is not given a new contract . Allardyce still harbours the ambition of being England coach having just missed out when Steve McClaren was given the job in 2010. Big Sam believes his CV could be enhanced by managing abroad - in Spain, Holland or Germany. He will not be short of options in the Premier League though - Sunderland and QPR are two possible destinations. Or he could take some time out and see what job crops up in the autumn. David Moyes, who has rebuilt his reputation with Real Sociedad, is one of the candidates to replace Allardyce at West Ham along with Slaven Bilic of Besiktas and Marseille's Marcelo Bielsa. Real Sociedad manager David Moyes is one of the candidates to replace Allardyce at West Ham this summer . I am also hearing . Rio Ferdinand could be offered the chance of a swansong in Major League Soccer depending on which club have spaces when their transfer window opens in June. Ferdinand, 36, may also find he is in demand in other territories such as Qatar and India. QPR are unlikely to offer Ferdinand a new contract when the one-year deal he signed after leaving Manchester United on a free last summer expires. Ferdinand, currently out injured, has made just nine appearances for Rangers this season. The former England captain's other option is to retire and pursue a career in the media or in coaching. QPR defender Rio Ferdinand could be offered the chance to play in the USA, India or Qatar next season .","Sources in Spain suggest Real Madrid could sell Gareth Bale this summer .

"'You're getting the hang of this commentary lark,' cooed Martin Tyler during Sky Sports coverage of the Manchester derby. Tyler was, of course, one half of the commentary team that was once seen as being the best of the bunch. That other half back then being his old partner Andy Gray. Nowadays, the man in the gantry alongside him is Gary Neville. And it was his zinger after United's fourth goal – 'Smalling has scored. It's a mauling for City' – that got the veteran lip mic man reaching for the platitudes. And perhaps cementing the new best partnership in the process? I'm not sure if Neville actually carries his recently won Royal Television Society Pundit of the Year award around with him? He could probably just about squeeze the perspex trophy into his inside jacket pocket if he really fancied it, but I doubt he would because I think one thing you could never accuse Neville of being is one of the extroverts among the current batch of experts. Gary Neville  in the Sky Sports studio after co-commentating with Martin Tyler for the Manchester derby . Chris Smalling is pictured scoring for Manchester United as City goalkeeper Joe Hart sees it go in . United defender Smalling was an unlikely goalscorer against City and Neville had a zinger to match it . Co-commentator Neville analysed the goal by saying: 'Smalling has scored. It's a mauling for City' Nevertheless, on his return to his old stamping ground with that new title attached, it was good to see him to turn it on even just a bit. And put in a performance that fitted both his newly anointed status and the magnitude of the occasion. Neville was all over this thrilling derby right from the get go. 'We've got a proper game of football here,' he extolled early on, almost licking his lips at the prospect. He was also quick to point out what he saw as the 'graveyard' of City's right-hand side as United punished them time and time again along the hosts' attacking left. The razor-edged corner of tongue was saved not exclusively, but certainly frequently for Yaya Toure's performance. Time and time again Gary found himself talking about the various patches of grass in which he felt Yaya should be but very rarely was. And when co-commentator Tyler did observe that he could see Toure finally picking up his man, Neville snorted his retort. 'That's nice of him.' He was in equally abrupt mood after the game when he joined Niall Quinn and Graeme Souness for what was a really sharp, incisive and no-holds-barred post-match discussion. Time and time again Neville found himself analysing Yaya Toure's poor performance for City . Toure could do little for City as they suffered a 4-2 defeat by their great rivals United at Old Trafford . Neville (right)and Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher form a dynamic Monday Night Football duo . Here Toure carried on getting it from Gary - who referred to the 'dereliction of duty' in his performance before adding that Yaya's recent form was: 'Not a conundrum anymore. He cannot do his job. Simple as that.' What's more, he was equally gobsmacked by Yaya's team-mates' lack of urgency when Aguero scored a late second. 'I can't quite work out whether to get a little bit wound up by this? I'm looking at their reaction. Is that right?' he asked. However, let's not assume this criticism is all because Gary is simply red. On discussing City's immediate Financial Fair Play-affected future, he made it quite clear where he stands. 'I'm a Manchester United fan,' he pointed out, pointlessly. 'But the last thing I want to see is Manchester City dip back down again to the second or third division because they can't challenge because there's some restrictive rule in place. 'We don't want a Real Madrid-Barcelona. We want competition.' Neville was damning in his analysis of City and freely admits he is a United fan after his years of service . Neville was gobsmacked by the City players' lack of urgency when Sergio Aguero (above) scored a second . This turned out to be not only the right moment, but also the right kind of game to make that point. Early in the coverage, host Ed Chamberlain told us 'the eyes of the football world' were watching. Over shots of a touchline teeming with camera crews, he went on to inform us there were '22 broadcasters here' and that the game was 'being beamed to over 100.' Sky Sports then went on to present those broadcasters with exemplary game coverage coupled with some lovely vignettes of the occasion. As well as a close up of the deep set, brooding eyes of Manuel Pellegrini that may haunt me for a fortnight. All in all, it was great coverage of a great game in a genuinely great league. As confirmed by a ton of countries, and Manchester's own Gary Neville.","Manchester United beat their rivals City 4-2 at Old Trafford on Sunday .

"Sporting America fell in love with him because of his skill under pressure and his sheer bravura. The rest of America fell in love because of what happened after the winning putt was holed. The 79th Masters attracted massive ratings in the USA and there is no surprise in that. They tuned in to watch as perfect a demonstration of sporting endeavour as you will ever behold. But they also tuned in to watch a man with a common touch and a depth of sincerity that reached into the heart of every household. Politicians who try so hard to be popular could learn much from 21-year-old Masters champion Jordan Spieth. The green jackets and dignitaries sitting behind him were enraptured as the winner gave an unscripted speech so gracious and natural you would think that public speaking was his calling rather than the Royal and Ancient game. Jordan Spieth wears his new green jacket after winning the Masters at Augusta on Sunday . Spieth hugs members of his family after securing his first ever major title at Augusta National . Spieth walks back onto the 18th green to formally acknowledge the large crowd watching on . As he stepped off the final green he embraced, in turn, his father Shawn, his mother Chris, his college sweetheart Annie, his brother Steven, who plays college basketball, his grandfather and various friends. And then he remembered his father’s words: ‘Make sure you say thank you to the people, son.’ So he went back on to the 18th green and formally acknowledged the patrons crammed into every available space. With this victory, Spieth must have killed forever the idea that you have to have a cold heart and a ruthless edge to be a winner. You will not find a single pro on the PGA Tour with a bad word to say about him. There is nothing fake about Jordan Spieth. Texans are supposed to be brash and larger than life, right? This one makes jokes about his receding hairline and dislikes being asked why he comes across as humble because, well, that would not be humble. Listen to Phil Mickelson, the Masters specialist who cheerfully admitted he had been outplayed by a man who had competed at Augusta only once before. ‘He’s just a class guy in every way and it’s difficult not to root for him,’ said the leftie. Spieth watches his tee shot on the seventh hole during the final round . Spieth gives a fistpump after making a birdie putt on the third green on the final day . ‘This is a momentous week in the history of our game. Along with Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth is going to carry it for the next decade and what an exciting time it promises to be.’ Sir Nick Faldo, on American television, sums up perfectly the feelings of a sport at the end of truly epochal week. Listen to Jack Nicklaus, who posted this tribute: ‘Congratulations to an exceptionally talented young man. That was an incredible performance. Jordan is so beyond his years. I like everything about him. He’s polite, he’s humble, he handles himself so well, on and off the golf course. And he’s obviously a wonderful player and now a Masters champion.’ The one family member who was not present to enjoy the celebrations was his 14-year-old sister Ellie, who suffers from a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. Hardly a day goes by when Spieth does not Facetime Ellie and every time they talk she asks him if he has won yet. ‘I’ll finally be able to tell her yes,’ he said, smiling. When Spieth speaks about Ellie there is no pity or anything maudlin in his voice, only joy, laughter and pride. ‘I know she was watching on television and I think she’s going to be a bit jealous of us all hugging round the 18th green,’ he said. ‘She’s going to want a present.’ Golf should not have been Spieth’s game at all. Nobody in the family plays — they are all big basketball fans. But Spieth was given a set of plastic clubs at the age of four and took it from there. Spieth (front) is presented with his green jacket by last year's Masters champion Bubba Watson . Spieth kisses his girlfriend Annie after a sensational victory at the Masters . Perhaps the only serious criticism he has attracted came when he dropped out of the University of Texas after his first year. It was well-meaning. By the age of 19 he had an amateur record so good he had positively lapped his fellow competitors and done well in the US Open, finishing 21st. But why the hurry? Why not complete his education? Throughout his life Spieth has known exactly what he wants — from the fact he is still with the girl he met in college to his caddie Michael Greller. He is a maths teacher by trade but Spieth persuaded him to come out on tour after the pair hit it off straightaway. Spieth just felt he was ready and it was not long before he was showing why. When he set out he was ranked 809th in the world. Now he is No 2 behind Rory McIlroy. In 18 months, he has banked more than $13million (£8.86m) on the PGA Tour alone. In his past four events he has won two and finished second twice and when he says: ‘I don’t see this as a great run of form, I see this as normal,’ it does not come across as at all boastful. Spieth (right) pictured with his college sweetheart girlfriend Annie . Spieth spends time with his family as he poses for a photo with sister Ellie (centre) and brother Steven (right) Asked about McIlroy, as ever, he found exactly the right words: ‘He’s got four majors and numerous wins and right now that’s something I can only dream about. I’ll never hit it like he does and I have to make up for that somewhere else. But I’m looking forward to getting in the heat of the moment with him in the near future and testing our games.’ How on earth did golf get this lucky? A sport with a fuddy-duddy, middle-aged image? Consider this: the world’s top two players have an average age seven years younger than the top two in tennis. The game is very fortunate to have a man like McIlroy. It is doubly lucky to have a personable 17-year-old in Lydia Ko at the top of the women’s game. Now Spieth has come along and golf feels truly blessed. Spieth pictured in his younger days playing basketball left-handed . It was with good reason that one of our competitors declared on the eve of the Masters that English golf had reached the end of an era, with no players ranked in the world’s top 10 for the first time at a major since 2008. But, following the encouraging events at Augusta, there should be good days ahead. Three players ranked in the top six was as many as the host nation, with Ian Poulter and Paul Casey (tied sixth) doing enough to suggest they will win at least once each before this season is out. As for joint runner-up Justin Rose, whose 14-under-par total would have won 74 out of 79 Masters, here’s a prediction: over the next five years he will add at least one more major to his 2013 US Open win. England's Justin Rose on the 18th green on Sunday after finishing tied for second on 14-under-par . Driving . No contest here.

"The potential domestic auction for Liverpool's Raheem Sterling this summer could decide which of Chelsea, Manchester City or Manchester United lure Gareth Bale from Real Madrid. As first revealed in Football Grapevine last month, Liverpool have put a £50million price tag on Sterling if they opt to sell the 20-year-old. Should Sterling leave for one of the Barclays Premier League's big three, then the other two will focus on trying to persuade Bale to leave Madrid. A potential domestic auction could be sparked for the purchase of Liverpool's Raheem Sterling . Chelsea, Manchester City or Manchester United are among those watching Sterling ahead of the summer . It could decide where Gareth Bale ends up if one club gets Sterling and the other two miss out . It promises to become a tangled transfer web. Bale is, from a playing and commercial point of view, a far 'safer bet' given his proven CV. But his fee of £75m and near £300,000-a-week wages mean his acquisition would restrict other signings under financial fair play guidelines. It's also the case that Bale may not agree to a return to any of the three Premier League clubs who can afford him. Indeed he has indicated he would like to continue at Madrid. But such has been the adverse reaction of many Madrid fans to him this season he may find it difficult to 'tough it out'. And the Spanish club may feel it is a good time to 'cash out'. As it stands Liverpool will not budge from their £100,000-a-week contract offer to England international Sterling, whose advisors believe he is worth about £150,000 in the current market. Liverpool will not budge from their £100,000-a-week contract offer to England international Sterling . Bale (left) pictured during a Real Madrid training session with Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo . Bale's £75m  fee and near £300,000-a-week wages mean his signing would restrict clubs under FFP guidelines . The stance of the Liverpool hierarchy, though, is they will not scrap their salary ladder scale for Sterling in the belief he has not yet justified moving up to their existing top bracket of £140,000-a-week that departing Steven Gerrard has been on or Luis Suarez pocketed before leaving for Barcelona. Given that he has two years left on his existing £35,000-a-week contract, the club feel  if Sterling will not agree they should cash in, even if means selling to one of the rivals - even United. Argentine Paulo Dybala,  dubbed by Palermo president Mauricio Zamparini as 'the new Sergio Aguero', is set to be on his way to the Premier League this summer. The destination depends on the outcome of the Sterling saga but both Liverpool and Arsenal are in for the 21-year-old. Paulo Dybala, dubbed 'the new Sergio Aguero', is set to be on his way to the Premier League . The destination depends on the outcome of the Sterling saga but both Liverpool and Arsenal fancy him . The 21-year-old currently plays for Palermo in Italy but could be on his way to England this summer . Liverpool have been strongly linked with a move for Arsenal's Theo Walcott but the player's wage demands may put off the Anfield outfit. Walcott signed a near £100,000-a-week deal with the Gunners just two years ago but is already seeking improved terms to commit himself to the club for a further five years. It remains to be seen whether Arsenal are prepared to up his wages again given his appearance record over the past two years which has been hampered by more injuries. Liverpool have been strongly linked with a move for Arsenal's Theo Walcott during the summer . Walcott signed a near £100,000-a-week deal with the Gunners just two years ago but could leave London . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers would see Walcott as an ideal replacement for Sterling but would only want to pay about the £100,000-per-week mark. If Walcott was still attracted to a move to Anfield, where he would command more regular football, then Arsene Wenger would make a move for Dybala. If Sterling goes and Walcott stays with the Gunners, Liverpool could then move in for the highly-rated Dybala. He is a centre forward who can also operate on the wing and is currently valued in the £15m bracket. Marcelo Bielsa has emerged as one of the front runners to succeed Sam Allardyce as West Ham manager. If, as seems certain, the Hammers do not give Allardyce a new contract in the summer then the club could turn to Argentine Bielsa, currently in charge of Marseille, who lie third in the French league in touching distance of leaders Lyon. Bielsa has an impressive CV having managed the national teams of both Argentina and Chile. Marcelo Bielsa could join the Premier League if he replaces West Ham manager Sam Allardyce . Bielsa and Hernan Crespo relax before Argentina's ill-fated 2002 World Cup campaign . Among the clubs he has managed include Athletic Bilbao in Spain, where he earned a reputation of promoting exciting football in a 3-3-3-1 formation. He is regarded as a progressive attacking coach with both Diego Simeone and Mauricio Pochettino  influenced by the 59-year-old. But the appointment of Bielsa would still be a gamble by West Ham. Allardyce may not be handed a new contract during the summer by West Ham when his current deal expires . Bielsa could replace Allardyce if his current contract is not extended by Premier League club West Ham . Over the years he has earned the nickname EL Loco - 'The Mad One'. His command of English is limited and he has little knowledge of the Premier League. The need for West Ham not to even be close to a relegation battle in their last season at the Boleyn Ground before moving to the Olympic Stadium, is obvious. Other contenders on West Ham's long list include Slaven Bilic, Rafa Benitez, Brian Laudrup, Frank Rijkaard and David Moyes. Once Manchester United have completed the long-mooted move for Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season, they will - as also predicted here - set their sights on Southampton's right back Nathaniel Clyne. It has been suggested United will offer striker Javier Hernandez, currently on loan at Real Madrid, as part of the deal to land by Clyne. But West Ham are also interested in signing Hernandez. Manchester United will set their sights on Southampton's right back Nathaniel Clyne this summer . United are set to complete their highly anticipated move for Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund . Chelsea are set to move in for Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Rob Green to act as No 2 to Thibaut Courtois with Petr Cech on his way out of Stamford Bridge. Arsenal and Liverpool have been linked with Cech. Chelsea would prefer to sell £10m-rated Cech abroad. Real Madrid or Paris Saint-Germain are likely to be in the market. Chelsea are set to move in for QPR goalkeeper Rob Green to replace Petr Cech at Stamford Bridge . I am hearing . While on England duty Sterling was urged by several around the camp to take a step back and consider the potential downsides of leaving Liverpool at this stage of his career, even if he will land bigger wages for the time being. I hear it was even put to Sterling that the saga now unfolding is more in the short-term interest of his advisor Aidy Ward than his long-term progression as a player. Indeed the Liverpool player should look at what happened to Shaun Wright-Phillips a decade ago. Sterling was reportedly urged by people in the England camp to sit back and think before leaving Anfield . It was in 2005 that Wright-Phillips left Manchester City - before they were big time - for Chelsea in a £21m deal, which was massive at the time. At the time 23-year-old Wright-Phillips looked as though he could be a world beater. But he was never a regular at City and his hugely promising career both at club level and England never reached its potential. Now at QPR, 33-year-old Wright-Phillips has made one Premier League appearance this season. Shaun Wright-Phillips left City for Chelsea in a £21m deal in 2005 but he never reached his potential .

"It is probably fair to say that never before in the history of the Masters has a crowd 10 deep assembled around the first tee at 4.20pm on the first official day of practice. Normally by then the estimated 70,000 crowd are streaming happily to the exits, savouring the day they saw Amen Corner in the flesh and clutching large shopping bags containing millions of dollars-worth of precious Masters merchandise. Given no phones are allowed in the grounds, how did word spread so quickly that the thing they had waited all day to witness was finally going to happen? They knew all right. Tiger Woods returns to action at Augusta National Golf Club to practice ahead of The Masters 2015 . Woods is given a warm welcome from the crowd and soon stops to sign autographs for some of his fans . Woods was making his first public appearance in 60 days since announcing a hiatus from golf . Woods is greeted by European Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke (right) at Augusta National Golf Club . And what a reception they afforded the main man as Tiger Woods stepped back into public life after his 60-day leave of absence. A couple of minutes later, it was like he had never been away as his drive flew wickedly left and spectators were running for cover. In the end, he finished in the middle of the adjacent ninth fairway. What he would give for such luck come Thursday. He had a perfect line to the flag and duly stroked a crisp mid-iron to 10ft and rolled in the birdie putt. Then it was time to practice his chipping from each side of the green — and everyone’s attention went up a notch. After his well-documented chipping problems in January, all eyes are being trained on how he copes with the infamous tight lies at Augusta. Woods practised to spots where he knows the flags will be located over the four days of the tournament. His action looked smooth and confident. He hit 16 chips from the front and right of the green and most finished close to the tee pegs that signified the imaginary holes. None were chunked. So it continued, in positive fashion. At the par-five second, he was putting for an eagle three. At the difficult par-three fourth, he positively skipped off the tee as his long iron finished tap-in distance away. After nine holes where the ball was struck with impressive authority, Woods decided to call it a day. Nothing, of course, can be read into what happens in practice, but one thing is for certain. At this place where he can draw upon so many happy memories, Woods is going to have an awful lot of goodwill to help him along. By contrast, Rory McIlroy practised at the other end of the day. In the past, Masters Monday was one where he would seek out an experienced hand for wisdom. Now he was the one passing on the insight, as he strolled to the tee with British Amateur champion, Bradley Neil. The promising 19-year-old from Blairgowrie considers driving the ball his strongest suit and was understandably pleased to find the middle of the first fairway. ‘I was feeling really happy and Rory steps up and crunches it 40 yards past me,’ said Neil. ‘I just thought: “Phew, he’s good, isn’t he?”’ Just days until 25-year-old McIlroy’s tilt at the career Grand Slam and the thing that struck Neil was that you would have struggled to tell who was the amateur here to soak up the experience and who was the history man. Rory McIlroy hits a tee shot during the practice session at Augusta National Golf Club on Monday .

Woods hits an impressive chip shot on to the putting green at Augusta National Golf Club on Monday . ‘It just tells you how strong he is mentally when he can be so calm,’ said Neil. ‘He’s got this chance to join the greats and yet talking to him you would have never known it.’ What did they talk about? ‘A lot of small talk actually,’ said Neil, who is trying to become the first British amateur since Peter McEvoy way back in 1978 to make the cut. ‘There’s only six years between us, so we talked about girls and things. Strangely, his life seemed to be a lot quieter than mine.’ Plan A called for the pair to play nine holes but Neil got the bonus of a further nine as McIlroy decided to play a full round. Perhaps he had one eye on the weather forecast, which is dire enough to wonder whether there will be any practice rounds at all. The highlight of Neil’s round came early, when he holed a 90-yard pitch shot at the second for an eagle three. McIlroy could not stop laughing. Two weeks ago during a private practice session here, Neil had done exactly the same thing. McIlroy, who was also on a reconnaissance mission, was standing on the adjacent third tee at the time. ‘Do yourself a favour Bradley, and don’t ever go for this green in two,’ said Rory. On the 18th, McIlroy finished in the style he will be looking for come Sunday. A perfect drive was followed by a typically towering iron shot that finished just 10ft from the hole and he knocked in the birdie putt. And so, late in the day, the attention switched to Tiger, where the crowd spoke as one. They were pleased to see him back. McIlroy hits a tee shot at the practice session at Augusta ahead of The Masters' start on Thursday . McIlroy and amateur Bradley Neil (left) practice their short game on the green at Augusta on Monday . Woods has not won a major since the 2008 US Open and will be keen to return to form as soon as possible . EUROPEANS HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND . Perhaps someone will do a television mini series and call it Modern Masters Mysteries. Part one would be what the heck has happened to the Europeans at Augusta. And part two would be how left handers have managed to produce 50 per cent of the champions over the last dozen years while comprising barely three per cent of the field. When Jose Maria Olazabal collected the second of his two green jackets in such emotional circumstances in 1999, it marked the 11th victory by a European in the 19 editions since Seve Ballesteros became the first in 1980. There has not been one since. During this millennium, the Europeans have won four US Opens, produced five Open champions, while there have been four triumphs at the US PGA Championship. They have also won six of the eight Ryder Cups staged during that time frame. But at the major where they used to enjoy the most success? There have barely been any serious contenders, let alone newcomers to the champions' locker room. Lee Westwood was runner-up to Phil Mickelson on one occasion while the Swede Jonas Blixt finished joint second last year. That is it in terms of top two finishes. Why the dramatic shift in fortunes? As Rory McIlroy pointed out, part of the explanation has to come down to the fabulous Augusta combination of Tiger and Phil, who have won seven Masters between them. Other than that, it is a hard one to fathom. As the successes in the other majors showed, there has been no shortage of quality. While the Europeans have been shut out, the left handers have prospered like never before. When the Canadian Mike Weir won the 2003 Masters he was only the second lefty to win any major (Bob Charles, with his 1963 Open triumph, was the other) let alone the Masters. Since then, Mickelson has weighed in with three victories before giving way to Bubba Watson, who has won two of the last three, making it six victories out of the last 12. It used to be said the perfect shape shot for Augusta was a high draw but the lefties can better that since their equivalent is a high fade, and the ball always spins more and lands softer when the shot is a fade. When you are dealing with the fine margins that prevail at Augusta National, that is a considerable plus. There is also Paul McGinley's geekish theory that the modern three-piece ball is harder to keep in the air when hit with a draw, thereby hurting the right handers at the Masters. My own theory? Two left handers with perfect games for Augusta just happened to come along at almost the same time. Both have the power and the touch that is so vital to success in these parts. But when Mickelson and Watson are past their best, do not be surprised if we go back to the Masters being dominated by those on the right.

"Raheem Sterling could force his way out of Liverpool this summer, costing the club up to £25million while saving potential suitors such as Manchester City and Chelsea the same amount. Under Premier League regulations the 20-year-old is entitled to 'buy-out' the last year of  his current contract which runs out in 2017. The effect of that would  see the fee Liverpool could command for the forward dramatically reduce. Raheem Sterling has rejected a new £100,000-a-week contract with Liverpool and could leave this summer . The 20 year-old could lower his value by buying-out the last year of his current deal for £1.7million . Liverpool insist they will hold firm and not be forced into selling Sterling in the close season. However, the Reds would have to reconsider their stance if Sterling and his advisers go down the route of buying out a chunk of his contract. It is understood Liverpool value Sterling as high as £50million given his age, talent and potential. However, if Sterling effectively only had one year left on his contract that fee would be reduced considerably - perhaps even in half to £25 million. With Sterling currently on a £35,000 a week, it would cost the England international £1.7m to buy out the last year of his contract. That sum could swiftly be recouped in the form of a signing on fee with a new club and, of course, in wages. Manchester City and Chelsea are both keen on Sterling, pictured racing against Philippe Coutinho . Sterling's value could plummet by up to £25million is he chooses to buy-out the final year of his contract . Liverpool have remained steadfast that their current offer of £100,000-a-week, with potential increments, is more than fair. But the player and his advisers believe he is now worthy of earning in the region of £150,000-a-week. That is the sum the Sterling camp believe they can get elsewhere with clubs they feel are more likely to play Champions League football. Thus far, the stalemate between Sterling and Liverpool does not seem to have affected his performances too much. However, there are those close to the club who feel the situation cannot continue to rumble on for too long for fear of upsetting the mood of the camp. The situation also has the potential to affect Liverpool's moves in the transfer market this summer. Slaven Bilic remains the name that keeps bouncing back from West Ham sources as the most likely to replace Sam Allardyce this summer. Bilic, a  West Ham hero as a player, has an impressive managerial CV having coached Croatia and also has Champions League experience with current club Besiktas. Besiktas manager Slaven Bilic is in the frame to replace Sam Allardyce at West Ham this summer . However, Bilic has not managed in the Premier League and the West Ham hierarchy are nervous about who comes in to take over from Allardyce given how crucial staying in the top-flight is next season with the club moving into the Olympic stadium in 2017. While Swansea's Garry Monk last week dismissed stories linking him to a move to Upton Park, the 36-year-old has been added to West Ham's 'long list' along with Michael Laudrup, Rafa Benitez, Marcelo Bielsa and Frank Rijkaard. Southampton are set to make a move for Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez when the transfer window opens. The Saints believe they could pip West Ham in a move for the Mexican forward, currently on loan at Real Madrid, by offering  Nathaniel Clyne to United for a reduced fee of £20m. Southampton could offer Nathaniel Clyne (right) to Manchester United in order to sign Javier Hernandez (left) Jurgen Klopp's decision to quit Borussia Dortmund caused immediate reports that he could take over at Manchester City or Arsenal this summer. The speculation in each case was not without foundation. Although Manchester City retain the stance they will remain loyal to Manuel Pelligrini, there is bound to be a review of the Chilean's position at the end of what has become a disappointing season. While it would seem Arsenal's revival will see Arsene Wenger remain in the Gunners' hotseat for another season, the sudden and rare availability of a coach with a CV and reputation such as Klopp's could focus minds at the north London club and raise questions about long term planning and an improvement of the clubs Premier League and Champions League challenges. Meanwhile, German club Wolfsburg remain interested in Everton's unsettled striker Romelu Lukaku. Jurgen Klopp could  move to the Premier League after announcing that he will leave Borussia Dortmund . Tottentham could make a move for Aston Villa forward Christian Benteke this summer. Despite the rise of Harry Kane, Spurs still want to bolster their strike force. However, West Ham, with  big ambitions in the build up to their move to Olympic stadium, may take on rivals Spurs in a £20m-plus battle for the Belgium international with the Hammers in the market for a new marksman. Aston Villa's in-form striker Christian Benteke is a summer transfer target for Tottenham and West Ham . I am hearing . Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic has attracted the attention of several clubs given that he has yet to be offered a long term deal by the Hornets. Despite taking Watford to the brink of the Premier League, the 46-year-old Serb - who has revived the club since taking over in October - still has no idea whether he will be given a long-term deal. That will surely be the case should Watford gain promotion. However, if they miss out, Jokanovic could be on the market. There would be plenty of Championship clubs interested and some possible suitors in the Premier League such as Sunderland. Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic is still not sure whether he will be in charge of the Hornets long-term . I am also hearing . West Ham insist they will not be listening to offers for left back Aaron Cresswell. The defender has attracted the attention of several top clubs including Chelsea. However, an offer of £20m could turn their head. The Hammers would then return to Ipswich, having signed Cresswell from the Tractor Boys for £5m last summer, and offer a similar sum for 22-year-old Tyrone Mings. Mings, who replaced Cresswell at left back, is also on Arsenal's radar. West Ham want to keep hold of defender Aaron Cresswell, who is a target for Premier League leaders Chelsea .

"What we may be witnessing in these opening jousts of the season is the mental disintegration of Nico Rosberg as a racing driver. His reaction to losing to Lewis Hamilton – blaming the Brit for slowing down and bunching him up as the attacking Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel closed on him – told us more about his own state of mind than it offered fair criticism of Hamilton. Rosberg was, I thought, disgruntled by his failure to match his team-mate during a run of eight wins in the last 10 races. In those emotionally charged minutes after the Chinese Grand Prix nothing seemed to make sense to him, rational thought was fuzzy and Hamilton appeared in his mind as a blurry figure of hate. Nico Rosberg (left) looks less than impressed after finishing second to Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton . The German driver blamed Hamilton for slowing down and bunching him up as Sebastian Vettel closed in . Rosberg (left), Hamilton (second right) and Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel celebrate on the podium in China . It was all the more remarkable given that Rosberg was for so much of last season the ultimate expression of focus, coolness, intelligence and calculation. There was no chink in his well-tailored shell of composure. That changed in the aftermath of Spa last August, when Rosberg was punished by the team (he was made to pay for the damage caused rather than fined as such, contrary to everyone’s interpretation at the time) for his part in an early crash with Hamilton. Rosberg's attitude seems to have changed in the aftermath of his crash with Hamilton in Spa last August . It was my view then and remains so that Rosberg was marginally more to blame for the collision, but that it was no more than a racing incident. The stewards agreed. They did not penalise either man. Yet, Mercedes made Rosberg a very public scapegoat, denting his confidence at a crucial moment in the season. He shrunk. Hamilton immediately seized the initiative, which he has never ceded in the slightest measure from that day to this. When on form, Hamilton is an extraordinary racer, maybe utterly unbeatable. And he is on form now, perhaps more so than ever in his life. That must eat at Rosberg’s heart. I am not writing off the German quite yet. I believe he is far tougher than his nickname Britney, as in Spears, suggests. He can be ‘nasty’ as Niki Lauda said of him. We can all recall examples of his cunning. But he is at a fork in his career, it seems. For if he cannot find a way to beat Hamilton soon, he could ebb away as Mark Webber did at Red Bull. Webber, a feisty competitor and a talented driver, was a genuine threat to Vettel in their first season fighting for the title, as Rosberg was to Hamilton in their intitial championship contest. But that was it for Webber. Vettel soon took total command, and his one-time rival was left to complain about his supposedly unfair treatment by the team, before fading into the distance and finally into retirement from Formula One. The 17-year-old Scuderia Toro Rosso driver Max Verstappen showed he has what it takes . My highlight of the Chinese Grand Prix was the pure, instinctive racing of Max Verstappen. His ability to go on the inside of his prey and brake at precisely the last moment was remarkable craftsmanship from a boy of 17. It reminded me of John Arlott’s tribute when a young, floppy haired David Gower began his England Test career with a nonchalant four. ‘Oh, what a princely entry,’ he growled. Bernie Ecclestone recently highlighted that commentators 'don’t fully understand' technical terms . Formula One has a greater than average obsession with its own navel. It never stops asking where it can improve itself to an extent that must bore any outsider to distraction. Over complicating the whole sport is an associated abomination that has increased in recent years through saturation coverage on television and the internet. Every smart aleck wants to show just how clever he is, however slight his underlying knowledge of the sport may be. Bernie Ecclestone recently picked up on this phenomenon, saying: ‘Commentators explain for an expert audience and not for people wanting to have an entertaining afternoon in front of their tellies. ‘And many times these commentators hide behind technical terms because they themselves don’t fully understand what is going on. There you have it.’ The nadir of this nerdy jargon is surely the description of tyres as ‘prime’ and ‘option’, terms that even the suppliers, Pirelli, wanted discontinued. So, to clarify: super soft tyres are always known as the ‘option’ tyres, when they are in use, which they are not always; softs can be ‘prime’ or ‘option’, so can mediums, though hards are ‘prime’ whenever they are available, which they are not always. It couldn’t be clearer, could it?","Are we seeing a mental disintegration of Nico Rosberg as a racing driver?

"So it seems you are either with me or firmly against me: there doesn’t appear to be a middle ground after my comments about Tim Krul. It is a week since I criticised Newcastle United’s goalkeeper for appearing to congratulate Jermain Defoe at half-time during the Wear-Tyne derby after the Sunderland striker beat him with a brilliant volley. I’m still struggling to work out why Krul did what he did. I have nothing against Krul, personally or professionally.

But coming together with an opponent and smiling after he’s scored against you in a match of such importance? No, I’m sorry. I can’t understand why any player would feel the need to do that. At the end of the game? That’s not an issue — there is no more appropriate place for sportsmanship. Think about the iconic image of Pele and Bobby Moore swapping shirts after Brazil had beaten England 1-0 at the 1970 World Cup or how two boxers will embrace after they have gone the distance — that is fantastic to see. When Liverpool beat Chelsea in the 2005 Champions League semi-final at Anfield, the first thing I did at the final whistle was go over to see John Terry to offer my respects for how well he’d played over the two legs. Would I have told him that at half-time with the game in the balance? No chance! We were talking about this subject at Sky on Monday morning. I bumped into former England rugby centre Will Greenwood and he told me a story about the end of the Rugby World Cup final in 2003, when Australia’s Elton Flatley scored a penalty with the last kick to take the game into extra-time. Pele (left) and Bobby Moore hug and swap shirts after the 1970 World Cup match between Brazil and England . Elton Flatley (left) levels the 2003 Rugby World Cup final with the last kick of normal time . Luis Garcia celebrates his winner for Liverpool against Chelsea in the 2005 Champions League semi-finals . Will said he went up to Flatley after that successful conversion and said to him: ‘Well done — you’ve got balls as big as houses for that.’ That is great sportsmanship but I’m not sure I could have done the same if I’d seen the World Cup ripped out of my hands. Andrew Flintoff, who famously went to console Brett Lee at the end of an Ashes Test in 2005, joined in the debate on Twitter. He clearly felt I had been harsh on Krul and he told me cricketers applaud the opposition batsman when he passes 50 or 100, quite often with a handshake. That’s all well and good. But will a batsman walk up to a bowler and pat him on the back after having his stumps uprooted? We have never seen that happen nor are we likely to. You don’t congratulate the opposition at a time when your team have been put on the back foot. I carried that approach during my career. There were more talented players than me but I had desire, focus and would never lose my intensity. I never, for instance, ever considered shaking hands or hugging an opponent in the tunnel before a match. The attitude stemmed from my childhood. Growing up as an Evertonian, I would work myself into a frenzy in the week before a derby match. I despised Liverpool then and I wanted the players who I supported to feel exactly the same way.

Defoe celebrates his strike which helped the Black Cats to victory in the Wear-Tyne derby . If, then, I’d seen Neville Southall put an arm around Ian Rush’s shoulder after he’d scored a goal, I’d have been devastated. I took that approach when I ended up playing against Everton. Put it this way — I couldn’t have shared a joke with Tim Cahill if he’d scored 30 seconds before half-time like Defoe. I appreciate some people reading this will feel it was extreme but that’s how I operated. Gary Neville has told me regularly that if I ever want to go into coaching or management, I will have to lower my tolerance levels since modern players are different and it isn’t worth falling out with them over certain things. I’m not saying my way is right or wrong but to be at my best I needed to be tense and wound up. If I thought to myself I needed to say ‘Well done’ to someone I was in direct competition with, I wouldn’t have been thinking about winning the game in which I was involved. That wasn’t me. Gerard Houllier was a manager who held similar views. He once saw one of our foreign players hugging an opponent in the tunnel before a game at Anfield and went berserk afterwards. ‘I never want to see that again from any of you — you are going to war with them,’ he said. ‘Save the hugging for in the bar afterwards.’ Carragher (left) argues with Gary Neville during a 2010 league match between Liverpool and United . Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier holds the FA Cup aloft after winning the trophy in Cardiff in 2001 . Houllier even told us before the FA Cup final in 2001 that he didn’t want us looking into the stand to see our families; given that I grew up watching players make the long walk at Wembley while waving to the crowd, that was quite a statement. But do you know something? I loved that. There is a time and a place for showing mutual respect and it is after the final whistle has gone and you are in the bar afterwards. Before that, you have business to take care of and that should be the priority — that’s why I felt so strongly about Krul. Others, of course, will take a different view and say I have been too harsh. I respect that. It doesn’t mean to say, though, that I can understand it. Underdogs City need show of strength . It is almost four years to the day since Manchester City struck a huge psychological blow in the battle to be top dogs in town. On April 16, 2011, Yaya Toure’s goal knocked Manchester United out of the FA Cup and set his club on a path of sustained success. It says everything for what was achieved back then at Wembley that City won six of the eight derbies that followed. Even when United won the title in 2013, there was a feeling that it was down to unrest behind the scenes with Roberto Mancini rather than the brilliance of Sir Alex Ferguson’s squad. Player for player, City’s quality was superior to their old rivals. Manchester City's Yaya Toure celebrates after scoring against United in the 2011 FA Cup semi-finals . Vincent Kompany (centre) lifts the trophy after Manchester City won the Premier League in 2012 . There is a similar feel about Sunday’s meeting at Old Trafford but this time City are vulnerable. United, having won their last five Barclays Premier League fixtures, are firm favourites and will feel confident of finally ending their neighbours’ title aspirations. If Louis van Gaal’s side win, the ramifications for City could be serious. There is no doubt United will spend big again in the summer and, with the full implications of Financial Fair Play kicking in, they might be able to recruit the players that City need. United will certainly fancy their chances but they should not take anything for granted. When the teams come out, City will still have the best striker on show in Sergio Aguero, the best midfielder in Toure, the most creative talent in David Silva and the finest defender in Vincent Kompany. Sergio Aguero (centre) in action for Manchester City against Crystal Palace on Monday night . Wayne Rooney (right) on the ball as Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal takes training on Friday . That quartet have not been at their best this season but, during the last four years, they have provided the best spine in the Premier League. They aren’t the problem at City — it’s the players around them who need to be improved. If City want to send a message to United — and for next season — Aguero, Silva, Kompany and Toure will have to show what we know they are capable of. Van Gaal is starting to put his stamp on United — they have improved since the switch to 4-3-3 — and has big ambitions. City have relished having United in their shade. To keep them there, they need a show of strength.","JAMIE CARRAGHER: Tim Krul was wrong to congratulate Jermain Defoe .

"Don't be fooled, Arsene. Don’t be caught out by this impressive run of form and think everything is in place for a crack at the title next year. It is not uncommon to see Arsenal finish a season with a string of good results. Usually they rattle out a sequence of wins just in time to preserve their place in the top four but too late to affect the destiny of the Barclays Premier League. The same thing has happened this year. Chelsea were relentless from the first whistle and have had the title race firmly under control since before Christmas. Arsenal players celebrate after their extra-time winner against Reading in the FA Cup semi-finals last week . Alexis Sanchez jumps in the air and celebrates wildly after his second goal for Arsenal at Wembley . With a 10-point advantage, even if Jose Mourinho loses to Arsene Wenger for the first time on Sunday it won’t stop his side becoming champions. Next year, though, Chelsea won’t have it all their own way and no team is better placed than Arsenal to dislodge them. There is a different feel to their form and performances this time around and Wenger said recently he could ‘smell’ something happening. You just hope, however, Wenger and Arsenal’s board don’t get fooled into thinking they have got all the tools they need at their disposal. This is not the time to be complacent. This is the summer when Arsenal must go for it and make the big additions that will stop them being nearly-men. That is exactly what Chelsea did 12 months ago. After finishing behind Manchester City and Liverpool, Mourinho didn’t mess around. In came Diego Costa, who had spearheaded Atletico Madrid’s La Liga success, and a World Cup winner in Cesc Fabregas. They meant business. The money was big but the quality was proven and, after they were unveiled, everyone began tipping Chelsea for the title. We might be doing the same with Arsenal come August if Wenger, who has been criticised for spending Arsenal’s money like it’s his own, is similarly ambitious. Arsenal, it should be stressed, are not in need of major surgery and the spine of their team is now much stronger than at any point last season, when they only just held off Everton’s challenge to finish fourth. But there is still room for improvement. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger talks to his players ahead of extra time at Wembley last Saturday . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho looks in fine form during a press conference on Friday . Results have been impressive since David Ospina replaced Wojciech Szczesny, who had failed to show the required consistency. Ospina has played 12 Premier League games; Arsenal have won 11 and he has kept six clean sheets, but Wenger still needs to buy a new No 1 if they are to be title challengers. Petr Cech would be an ideal candidate to come in. Laurent Koscielny has steadied things in defence, with Arsenal winning 15 of the 18 games he’s played since January 1 but, to progress, Wenger needs another top centre back. Gabriel Paulista arrived in the New Year but it seems it was to provide cover for Koscielny and Per Mertesacker. Francis Coquelin has added bite to the midfield, but would Arsenal have enough to challenge next season if Coquelin is their anchor and Mikel Arteta is his back up? No. Why doesn’t he go for Paul Pogba, who looks set to leave Juventus? Wenger spent £42m on Mesut Ozil, so why not spend the same and more on Pogba. If they needed to sign Ozil two years ago, their need to sign Pogba this summer is even greater. Diego Godin of Atletico Madrid is 29 and at the peak of his powers. He would be ideal at the heart of the defence. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina pictured during a training session at London Colney last week . Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech warms up before Saturday's Premier League clash against Manchester United . Olivier Giroud, meanwhile, has provided a focal point up front. I like Giroud. He is an under-rated striker and, had he not missed three months with a broken ankle, his tally would be more than 14; he averages a goal every 101.93 minutes, the second best rate in the Premier League. Giroud is one of a number of good options Wenger has up front. Alexis Sanchez has been brilliant, while Danny Welbeck has played his part, but that should not stop Wenger looking to improve on what he has got. If a forward with the class of players he has had before, such as Thierry Henry or Nicolas Anelka, comes on the market, Wenger would have to move for him. Imagine what Luis Suarez, Sergio Aguero or Karim Benzema could do for Arsenal? I’m not saying Arsenal are getting to the levels of ‘The Invincibles’ but their form has me thinking they are getting closer. The 2-0 win at Manchester City in January could be a turning point. They made themselves difficult to beat rather than being open. Hopefully we will see more of this. Arsenal's French striker Olivier Giroud looks forward as he advances with the ball at Wembley . Danny Welbeck (left) looks to evade the challenge of Reading's Hal Robson-Kanu (centre) and Alex Pearce . Of course it has been frustrating that they have not challenged for the title since last winning it 11 years ago, and Wenger has not had a smooth ride. Fans turned on him after they lost at Stoke — and after the Champions League defeat to Monaco — leading to talk about Jurgen Klopp coming in. But some perspective is needed. Wenger has done a good job keeping Arsenal consistently in the top four — all their rivals have dropped out at some point in between — and by the end of next month, they could have won back-to-back FA Cups. How could you then get rid of Wenger? So one question would need asking: what are they waiting for? Both Manchester clubs will spend in the summer, but both those clubs have got far more problems to fix. City’s squad is old and needs big investment, while United will have the complication of being back in Europe. Wenger, then, could use the next window to call it on. The message it would send out to his players, fans and, most significantly, their rivals would be huge. It would let everyone know they were launching an all-out assault on the title. They would have to be taken seriously. Beating Chelsea on Sunday won’t alter things in the short term, but it will offer belief that Arsenal can challenge next season. What they do in the window will determine how big a statement they can make. Finding some special players could transform them. Borussia Dortmund head coach Jurgen Klopp celebrates after beating SC Paderborn last weekend . Wenger applauds the Arsenal fans after his side booked their place in the FA Cup final . Big guns missed out on a Fab freebie . Full marks to Aston Villa. They are a side rejuvenated by Tim Sherwood and absolutely deserved to beat Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final. Jack Grealish understandably attracted most of the headlines for his outstanding performance but the role Fabian Delph played was just as important; his aggression, energy and left foot gives Villa balance in their midfield. Liverpool couldn’t cope with his aggression. Earlier this season, Delph was lauded for committing his future to Villa even when their position in the Barclays Premier League was threatened. He signed a four-year deal, which showed his character could never be called into question. What can be called into question, however, is the wisdom of some other clubs in the Premier League. Fabian Delph (right) celebrates after scoring for Aston Villa against Liverpool in the FA Cup semis . Delph, do not forget, was set to be out of contract this summer and a number of sides at the top of the table had their chance to sign a young England international for free. No doubt these same clubs will go out when the window opens and bring in at least one foreign midfielder, to go with the ones they signed last summer, and soon enough we will hear at some point next season that we don’t have enough English players playing for top sides competing in Europe. There will then be complaints from clubs saying it is impossible to buy English players because there is such a premium on them and they will argue that is why they are forced to look abroad for new signings. The Delph situation shows that sometimes such an argument is nonsense. He is now Villa’s captain and has been their best player for the last 18 months. His progress has been so impressive he is now a regular in the England squad and if he can add more goals to his game — like the one he scored against Liverpool — he could reach a very high level. Delph slots the ball past Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet in Villa's 2-1 victory at Wembley . If Delph does maintain his improvement, inevitably clubs will come looking at him. But if they want him, it will cost. For reasons only they know, they let slip a chance to get something good for nothing. Their loss is most certainly Villa’s gain.","It is not unusual to see Arsenal finish the season with good results .

"So who will be voted PFA Player of the Year? Eden Hazard is the hot favourite but whoever wins will have plenty of tactical voting to thank. I’m sure Hazard and the other leading contenders — in my mind David de Gea and Harry Kane — will benefit from their team-mates being careful with who they vote for. John Terry recently revealed he had chosen Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho — who has been very good but not great — as his nomination. There’s no way Terry can seriously believe Coutinho has been better than De Gea and Kane this season! There is more to it than meets the eye. John, I am almost certain, will have gone around Chelsea’s dressing room when the ballot papers came in and told the squad — given that you cannot choose one of your team-mates — under no circumstances should they vote for De Gea or Kane, who are Hazard’s biggest challengers. I’m sure the same happened in the Spurs and United dressing rooms. Chelsea winger Eden Hazard is among the front runners to win the PFA Player of the Year award this season . The Belgium international has been in superb form for Jose Mourinho's side as they look set to win the title . Hazard will have to beat off competition from Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea . Harry Kane is another of the favourites to pick up the individual gong after his heroics for Tottenham . How do I know? I did exactly the same thing in 2006 when Steven Gerrard won! I was Liverpool’s PFA representative back then and I made it clear that, for Stevie to win, nobody should vote for Thierry Henry or Frank Lampard! You might think that’s unfair but it is the same in every dressing room. The voting is, of course, already done but Hazard and De Gea come up against each other on Saturday and will both be eager to show that they should be regarded as the season’s standout performer. United are flying and the reason they are in this position is down to De Gea. He has come of age during the past two years and his performances in the first half of the campaign gave them a platform to build from. He is now in the top three goalkeepers in the world — when he arrived he wasn’t even in the top three in the Premier League. He will probably be the club’s player of the year again and that is as big an achievement as being up for the PFA award. The first time I played against him, he looked like a kid who had been pulled out of the youth ranks. He had no physical presence and it was something Liverpool looked to exploit during an FA Cup tie in January 2012. Jamie Carragher says Chelsea captain John Terry will have told his squad not to vote for Kane or De Gea to give Hazard a better chance of winning the award . Chelsea captain Terry revealed his vote for PFA Player of the Year was Philippe Coutinho . Carragher believes De Gea is one of the main reasons United are enjoying such a successful run . De Gea endured a difficult start to his United career as he struggled with physicality of the Premier League . Eden Hazard - Chelsea . Diego Costa - Chelsea . Harry Kane - Tottenham Hotspur . Alexis Sanchez - Arsenal . David de Gea - Manchester United . Philippe Coutinho - Liverpool . Daniel Agger scored a header to put us 1-0 up but his task was made easier because we crowded De Gea out and he simply didn’t have the power or the confidence to barge his way through a crowd of bodies. That is not something you could say about him now. But as good as he has been, I feel De Gea will miss out on becoming the first goalkeeper to win PFA Player of the Year since Pat Jennings in 1976. First, I think it helps if the winner comes from a team that are on course to win a trophy. Barring an unforeseen blip, Chelsea will win the title and that is why, if I was still playing, my vote would have gone to Hazard. He, simply, has been the best player in the best team. People may say ‘what about Luis Suarez, Gareth Bale and Robin van Persie?’ — the last three men to lift the PFA crown — but the consistency and quality of their performances meant they were impossible to ignore. Hazard's Chelsea team-mate Diego Costa has also been nominated for the award after netting 19 league goals . Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez makes the six-man shortlist after an impressive debut season in England . Terry voted for Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho, who completes the six-man shortlist . The PFA Young Player of the Year nominations are: . Eden Hazard - Chelsea . Harry Kane - Tottenham Hotspur . Philippe Coutinho - Liverpool . Raheem Sterling - Liverpool . David de Gea - Manchester United . Thibaut Courtois - Chelsea . I mentioned Terry will have been influential in the Chelsea dressing room when it came to voting. But on a serious note about him, I am very surprised that he is not on the shortlist. I would go as far to say that if Chelsea should have two contenders, it should be Hazard and their captain, both of whom have started all 31 league matches — not Diego Costa. I’m not saying Costa hasn’t been good but has he done more to influence Chelsea’s play than Terry? I’m not sure. John is still the best defender in the country and the heartbeat of his team. Is he playing better than he was five or six years ago? No. But he doesn’t allow his standard to drop. Put it another way — if he and Costa were absent for a game of great importance, I know who they would miss more. You could say something similar about Kane. His goals have helped Tottenham collect 21 points they might have gone without. He was at his peak when voting started and I’d be surprised if he doesn’t win the Young Player award. Terry has been as influential as ever for Chelsea this season and deserved a nomination ahead of Diego Costa, according to Carragher . Luis Suarez won the award in 2014 and Hazard picked up the Young Player of the Year award . One thing I cannot help feeling, however, is that the nominations show that this campaign has been anything but a classic. How can the same four players be up for both the PFA and Young Player award? Hazard won’t win the award by default but he certainly hasn’t got a highlights reel to match Suarez, Van Persie or Bale. It is interesting to see how Hazard measures up with Bale, who is getting criticism in Spain for not making a big enough impact at Real Madrid, yet after 27 games in La Liga he has scored 13 goals and made seven assists. Hazard, by contrast, has 12 goals in the Premier League — three of which have been penalties — and has eight assists. There isn’t a great difference in the numbers. But only one of them is anywhere close to being voted player of the year in their league. That shows us it hasn’t been a vintage season. Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale has 13 goals and seven assists compared to Hazard's 12 goals and eight assists, but is receiving criticism in Spain . Our league needs top-class defenders . The game of the week in the Champions League came when Madrid’s finest sides went to war at the Vicente Calderon. I have heard it said that the 0-0 draw was boring and the lack of goals made it dull but, in my view, nothing could have been further from the truth. It was an absorbing contest, as good a 0-0 as you could wish to see, and it showed why English clubs are struggling to make an impact in the competition. There will be a clamour this summer for our top sides to buy more and more exciting, attacking players but the displays of Atletico pair Miranda and Diego Godin and Real’s Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane showed the kind of additions we should be making. Atletico's Diego Godin closes in on Real Madrid's Bale during the pulsating 0-0 draw in the Champions League . Atletico defender Miranda challenges James Rodriguez as neither side managed to breach the other's defence . Ramos gets criticised in England for at times being rash but he is a top-class defender — Xabi Alonso emphasised that point on these pages when we spoke last November — and has been at the top for years, while Varane is a Rolls-Royce who could become the best in the world. Miranda has attracted the attention of Chelsea and Manchester United and it is easy to see why, but my favourite is Godin, a player who would have no qualms about tackling his grandmother to keep a clean sheet. He plays with that pure South American grit and steel. English clubs simply don’t have defenders who are willing to do that, perhaps with the exception of John Terry, and the statistics from our representatives in the Champions League this season prove that point emphatically. Liverpool, for instance, never kept a clean sheet in six matches in the group stages. Yes, they were in the same group as Real Madrid but failing to shut out FC Ludogorets and Basel over four matches was the reason they fell at the first hurdle. Former Liverpool man Carragher says Spain international Sergio Ramos is a top-class defender . Carragher says nothing would excite him more than the arrival of Raphael Varane or Godin to England . In the last 16, meanwhile, the numbers were just as damning. Chelsea couldn’t contain Paris Saint-Germain over two matches, conceding at both the Parc des Princes and Stamford Bridge, while Manchester City were easily breached twice by Barcelona when tumbling out. Arsenal did keep a clean sheet in Monaco but by then the damage had been done. How could they expect to progress after letting three in at the Emirates? The tie was effectively finished by their inability to keep the back door closed at home. When English clubs thrived in Europe between 2005-2009, it was because we were defensively solid. The Champions League is the best competition with the best players, so scoring goals shouldn’t be easy. With the new television deal about to kick in, we are going to hear stories about Gareth Bale returning and bids lined up for Paul Pogba and Marco Reus. Of course, they would be welcome additions. Nothing, though, would excite me more than the arrival of Varane or Godin. Chelsea failed to stop PSG scoring in either leg of their Champions League last-16 tie last month . Manchester City's backline was easily breached by Barcelona in their Champions League contest too .","The PFA announced the shortlist for Player of the Year earlier this week .

"I couldn’t wait to get out of Bournemouth, even though I loved the place. It was a holiday town, a place that would send you to sleep rather than drive you forward. Maybe it was the sea air; everything always manana. Then along came Eddie Howe. His team are anything but a team to send you to sleep. They are dynamic, full of hungry players, with a point to prove.

Gary Lineker asked if we have found ‘the English Special One’, but Eddie is not the Special One. He is the Different One. Watch Eddie on the touchline and you will see he is the opposite to Mourinho. Eddie is peaceful during a game, relaxed, quiet and controlled. His extrovert assistant, Jason Tindall, provides the instructions and the demands, with Eddie making his feelings known in a calm and gentle fashion. Obviously the Barclays Premier League will bring different demands for this young man, who is still only 37. Bournemouth's players slide along the turf in delight after their dream came true on Monday night . We got to know each other after my dad signed him for Portsmouth in 2002. He played only twice because of a knee injury that was similar to one that cost me my career. It eventually finished him, too, and while you don’t want to make friends through the same devastating injury, I am glad I got to know him. Some people you meet you can see are destined to be successful. He was always one of them. My dad liked him instantly and had a soft spot for him. I always thought my dad would be the king of Bournemouth, for their FA Cup giantkilling of holders Manchester United in 1984 and their promotion success when he took them into what is now the Championship. But Eddie has blown away those achievements. Lots of clubs will be admiring his progress and while he didn’t enjoy his experience at Burnley when he left Bournemouth in 2011, that won’t stop others casting an eye in his direction. Marc Pugh (left), Ryan Fraser and Harry Arter (right) toast the 3-0 win over Bolton that secured promotion . And why not? He is impressive. He has a good eye for talent, makes big calls, plays young players, is forward-thinking, ambitious and looks the part — he is a chairman’s dream. He will crave the opportunity to manage in the Premier League and will enjoy recruiting new talent. Bournemouth is a good place to bring up a family and he has also made it a good place to play. It is very different from the leaking stands and muddy pitch at Dean Court that I left behind. My childhood there was a big part of my life, cleaning Luther Blissett’s boots, training with Tony Pulis, Ian Bishop and Gerry Peyton and receiving my schooling in a football environment. But the away end had no roof and the old boys used to sit on wooden benches with cushions that they would throw at you when you were having a poor game. Jamie Redknapp believes Howe was destined for success as soon as got to know him in 2002 . Leaving for Liverpool at 17, I couldn’t get away fast enough. But now I can’t wait to get back there next season. I would never have thought all four of my clubs — Bournemouth, Liverpool, Spurs and Southampton — would be in the same league. Eddie Howe is the reason for that. I wonder if we are seeing an England manager in the making here.","Bournemouth secured promotion on Monday with victory against Bolton .

"On February 14, 1998, new kid on the block Michael Owen scored a hat-trick for Liverpool in a 3-3 draw with Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. Doing so on the most romantic day of the year was fitting for the division's newest heartthrob. The expectation surrounding Owen escalated, and the intro for the next day's report in the Liverpool Echo said it all: 'Brazil have Ronaldo. Liverpool, and now England, have Michael Owen.'

Best ever season total: 19 (and counting) It was a lot for young shoulders to take, yet four-and-a-half months later he scored that goal against Argentina at France '98. He handled it. Other England strikers created a similar hype. Wayne Rooney was one, Alan Shearer another. And now Harry Kane is dividing opinion. Some believe he will be the next name jotted on that prestigious list, others think he will be found out. This is where Kane can take note of Owen. It was he who, in 1997-98, scored 18 goals in 36 appearances in the Barclays Premier League. He kept it up at the 1998 World Cup, and did so the season after, too, scoring 18 goals again but in six fewer Premier League appearances. He never looked at the opposition as Manchester United, or Arsenal, or even Argentina. 'From one game to the next, I didn't even know who I was playing against – they were just names on a teamsheet, not big reputations, and that innocence served me well,' Owen once said. Kane has been just as fearless this year. The expectation on him is up there with Owen, and Rooney, and Shearer. Yet he must, at the very least, do it for another season; prove it is not a fluke, or a one-off, before he can even be considered a reason for England supporters to be chipper.

Kane will try to prove his outstanding Premier League season is not a fluke this year . 3 - no player had ever won Player of the Month three times in a row... but Kane tied with Dennis Bergkamp and Cristiano Ronaldo after winning it in January and February . 19 - Kane has matched Owen's best-ever total for a Premier League season . 22 - Kane's 19 goals have directly contributed 22 points to Tottenham Hotspur's 56 total . 25 - Kane has won the same amount of tackles as Vincent Kompany this season . 40 - Kane's 22 goals in 40 appearances in the Premier League beats Owen's 20 . 500 - Kane was 500/1 to be win the Premier League Golden Boot this season . Even so, that does not mean he shouldn't be celebrated, or that he can't do it. Kane, after all, has matched Owen's 19 goals in 2001-02 and 2002-03 – the BT Sport co-commentator’s best-ever total in a Premier League season – with eight games to spare. His 22 goals in his first 40 appearances beats Owen’s 20, too. Kane's goals have contributed 22 points to Tottenham Hotspur alone, taking them from a losing position to a winning one against Leicester City, Queens Park Rangers, Arsenal, and so on. They’d be 14th without. Nobody, by the way, had ever won the Player of the Month award three consecutive times. Dennis Bergkamp won it in August and September, 1997. Cristiano Ronaldo won it in November and December, 2006. Kane went desperately close to a third following five goals in March, only for Arsenal’s Olivier Giroud to deny him. Even so, being mentioned in the same breath as Bergkamp and Ronaldo will do the man who was struggling for a place in the Leicester City team just two years ago. Kane celebrates scoring against Queens Park Rangers for Tottenham in the Premier League at Loftus Road . Kane went desperately close to a third straight Player of the Month award - which has never been done before . Harry Kane and Vincent Kompany have – coincidentally – played 1,876 minutes each this season, and here's how they compare: . Tackles won: . 25 - Kane . 25 - Kompany . Tackles lost: . 30 - Kane . 37 - Kompany . The Tottenham product – 6ft 2in with hair slicked back and a traditional look about him – seems an old-fashioned centre forward. He was 500/1 at the beginning of the season to win the Premier League Golden Boot, and is not just another also-ran. In Diego Costa and Sergio Aguero, he is rivalling one man who cost Chelsea £32million, and another who won Manchester City the title three years ago. Analysing his style of play, however, isn't easy. He isn't known for having pace like Owen, or a cannon of a right foot like Shearer, or dribbling like Aguero, or a bravado like Costa – yet Kane appears a Jack of all trades. Ten goals with his right foot, five with his left, four with his head – he’s a right-place-at-the-right-time kind of striker, which never hurts. He’s precise, too, having had the third-most shots on target in the Premier League this year, behind Aguero and Queens Park Rangers striker Charlie Austin. Kane has had the third-most Premier League shots on target, behind Sergio Aguero and Charlie Austin . Kane appears a right-place-at-the-right-time kind of striker who is a Jack of all trades on the pitch . 88 - Sergio Aguero, Manchester City . 81 - Graziano Pelle, Southampton . 65 - Charlie Austin, Queens Park Rangers . 63 - Wilfried Bony, Swansea and Man City . 62 - Romelu Lukaku, Everton . 61 - Harry Kane, Tottenham Hotspur . 58 - Robin van Persie, Manchester United . 58 - Danny Ings, Burnley . 57 - Diego Costa, Chelsea . 55 - Saido Berahino, West Bromwich Albion . 47 - Sergio Aguero, Manchester City . 43 - Charlie Austin, Queens Park Rangers . 37 - Harry Kane, Tottenham Hotspur . 36 - Diego Costa, Chelsea . 35 - Romelu Lukaku, Everton . 35 - Alexis Sanchez, Arsenal . 33 - Wilfried Bony, Manchester City . 31 - Robin van Persie, Manchester United . 29 - Graziano Pelle, Southampton . 28 - Saido Berahino, West Bromwich Albion . Kane's heat maps against Leicester City (left) and Arsenal (right) show he's active in both halves . And don’t forget persistent. Consider the top 20 most distances covered by players during a Premier League match, and Kane features twice (13.01km vs Everton, and 13.12km vs Swansea City). It's no wonder his heat maps (above) show him active from one half to the other. Even chanelling his inner defender, Kane has made as many tackles (25) as Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany this season in the same amount of minutes (1,876) – and has lost fewer. Yet Italy proved more difficult to handle than Lithuania, or Leicester, or QPR. Kane was given a hard time by Giorgio Chiellini – a foul after 19 seconds serving as an unofficial welcome to international football – but he has had that treatment before. Not by the Italian, but by Chelsea captain John Terry. The Capital One Cup final at Wembley was among his more difficult afternoons, Kane admitted in an exclusive interview with Sportsmail previously, and it will only get harder. Kane was closely marked by Italy's Giorgio Chiellini in what was a taster of what's to come from defenders . Chiellini often had his arms wrapped around Kane during set pieces in England's friendly with Italy in Turin . Kane was barely given an inch by Chiellini during the international friendly and he can expect it to continue . Defenders catch on quick, and he will be marked intensely, as per Chiellini and Terry’s taster. Can his remarkable form continue for another season, and the one after that, and so on? Kane must avoid what happened to Michael Ricketts – a player who fell off the radar almost as quickly as he came on to it. Ricketts hit 12 goals for Bolton Wanderers in his first Premier League season by February 2002 to earn his England debut against Holland that same month, yet the striker did not score for  the rest of the season and never reached double figures for a club in the league again. What Kane doesn't want is to become the answer to a pub quiz question that asks which player scored 25-plus goals in 2014-15, only to never be seen again? Only he can make sure that doesn’t happen, and it begins with a half-decent 2015-16. Michael Ricketts hit 12 goals for Bolton Wanderers in his first Premier League season by February 2002 . He did not score for the rest of the season and never reached double figures for a club in the league again . Kane will try to avoid becoming a one-hit wonder in the Premier League and it starts with next season .

"Dutch football made a killing in the stock market this week. Yet its rise was not because PSV Eindhoven won their first Eredivisie title since 2008, ending Ajax's four-year reign. It was down to Memphis Depay, who scored his 20th goal of the season to confirm their 22nd championship in Holland. It turned heads at Manchester United. Yet Jim Lawlor, their chief scout, had been doing his homework long before Depay reached the total which Louis van Gaal holds in such high regard. PSV Eindhoven's Memphis Depay celebrates with the trophy after securing the Eredivisie championship . Depay (left) and PSV team-mate Georginio Wijnaldum (right) celebrate with the Eredivisie trophy . PSV manager Phillip Cocu (left) and top goalscorer Depay (right) clinched the title with three games to spare . 20 – Memphis Depay (winger) 19 – Luuk de Jong (striker) 16 – Michiel Kramer (striker) 14 – Michael de Leeuw (striker) 14 – Mark Uth (striker) The manager announced in February he lacked a striker who could score 20 goals. If a 21-year-old can do it from the wing in 27 appearances, albeit in Holland rather than England, is that not worth a £25million investment? Manchester United think so, and they are not alone. From 'official talks' with Liverpool, to 'discussions' with Paris Saint-Germain, to a not-so-secret meeting in Manchester. Depay has been busy, and no wonder. He is the Eredivisie's top goalscorer, without even being PSV's main forward. His 20 goals have contributed 12 points, which just so happens to be the difference between them and second-placed Ajax. Yet not many people had heard of Depay, particularly before the 2014 World Cup, so why the sudden case of rubbing hands together? How Depay could look for Manchester United should he make his £25m move to Old Trafford this summer . Depay pictured in action during PSV's title-winning victory against Heerenveen last weekend at home . Depay is the Eredivisie's top goalscorer with 20, without even being PSV's main forward in their attack . Depay was understood to have held a meeting in Manchester  as he nears his £25m move with Louis van Gaal . First, his background. He has 'dream chaser' tattooed across his chest, and 'successful' inked on the inside of his lower lip. Joining the iconic Manchester United brand would not contradict either, particularly given his difficult childhood. As a four-year-old, his parents separated. In 2012, after turning 18, he dropped 'Depay' from the back of his shirt as a snub to his absent father. Raised by his mother in the southern Dutch town of Moordrecht, he grew up in 'a small village where there is not much to do', so says Gigi, a childhood friend of Depay's. Yet some of the greatest footballers were created in such places. Take Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, for example. He grew up in poverty-stricken rural Chile in a mining town called Tocopilla – literal meaning Devil's Corner. With Depay poised to join the Barclays Premier League, talk is of him being paid the same as Sanchez – £130,000 a week. Yet the man handed his Holland debut just 18 months ago by Van Gaal remains relatively unknown. The manager sees something in him. As a player, Depay can be used as a makeshift forward, and has been likened to Cristiano Ronaldo by PSV manager Phillip Cocu and Ajax great Ronald de Boer. He's fast-paced, tricky, and physical. A left winger who cuts inside with a powerful right foot – not unlike his counterpart and compatriot Arjen Robben. His specialty is free-kicks. Five of his 20 goals were from dead-ball situations – his latest against Heerenveen seven days ago, when PSV were crowned champions with three games to spare. His talents aren't new to those in Holland, however. Nobody in Eredivisie completed more dribbles (101) last season, and he created the second-most chances (87), too. Depay has 'dream chaser' tattooed across his chest, and 'successful' inked on the inside of his lower lip . Depay celebrates with his Holland team-mate Arjen Robben during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Memphis, a right-footed left-winger, celebrates with his counterpart Robben, a left-footed right-winger . It is exactly what Manchester United need, given they have created fewer chances (332) than Queens Park Rangers (342) and Tottenham Hotspur (352) this season. It led to his potential being recognised by Europe's heavyweights during the summer. Called up, the then-20-year-old's goal against Australia made him the youngest Dutch scorer in the history of the World Cup, taking over from Boudewijn Zenden at France '98. That was Depay's first goal in Brazil, before his second against Chile – the same total England's squad managed as a collective in Group D. When Holland used a 4-3-3 formation, he got the nod to join Robben and Robin van Persie in a three-pronged attack. He had four shots, with 100 per cent accuracy, and scored two of them. Already a disciple of Louis van Gaal's philosophy, it seems. Compare Depay to Manchester United's other forwards – Wayne Rooney, Van Persie, Radamel Falcao and James Wilson – and he blitzes the averages of the rest. He scores a goal every 115.2 minutes (with Van Persie nearest on 119.3). He creates a chance every 41.9 minutes (with Rooney nearest on 62.5). He makes a run every 14.9 minutes (with Rooney, again, nearest on 37.1). And so on. How Depay could look for Manchester United (left) and the winger playing last week for PSV (right) Old Trafford forwards Wayne Rooney (from left to right), Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao and James Wilson . And yet, he is not the complete package. Not quite. He has been labelled greedy by some, averaging a shot every 19.9 minutes, having had 277 in 79 appearances in Eredivisie in the last three seasons. Even Gareth Bale, the supposed ball-hog at Real Madrid, averages fewer (24.3 minutes per shot). As is understandable with young players, his decision-making leaves a lot to be desired, too. He needs teaching, perhaps by his former national manager in Manchester. Depay wouldn't be the first to leave PSV for the Premier League, or even Old Trafford for that matter, after all. Thursday marked 14 years since Sir Alex Ferguson signed Ruud van Nistelrooy from PSV for a then-British transfer record of £19m. The striker went on to make 150 appearances, scoring 95 goals, averaging one every 128.2 minutes. A success. Depay wouldn't be the first to leave PSV for the Premier League, or Manchester United for that matter . Ruud van Nistelrooy (left) joined Manchester United from PSV, while Mateja Kezman (right) joined Chelsea . Three years after one PSV great arrived, another followed. Yet Mateja Kezman had little impact in the Premier League with Chelsea. He made just 25 appearances, scoring four goals with no assists, averaging one every 184.5 minutes. A dud. Depay could do worse than join the project at Manchester United. The Premier League can be as unforgiving as it is rewarding when it comes to potential-laden youngsters. They more often than not get found out, as £20m Brazilian Anderson was. Yet Depay can strive for great things, if his statistics are anything to go by, and putting it on the pitch at Old Trafford could be the next challenge for the 'dream chaser'. Depay could soon be joining the Premier League as he looks set to sign for Manchester United for £25m .","Memphis Depay held a secret meeting Manchester United recently .

"Manchester United had four different scorers On Sunday. At the start of the season I don’t think anyone would have thought that quartet would be anywhere near the team, let alone scoring vital goals in a huge Manchester derby. With all that money flashing around you would have picked Angel di Maria over Juan Mata, Marcus Rojo over Chris Smalling and just about anybody over Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young. But all four have proved their worth. People said Mata was too slow but his brain is certainly quick enough. Fellaini is now United’s go-to guy and Smalling has improved. Juan Mata celebrates after scoring against Manchester City, and he is part of Louis van Gaal's 'fab four' Ashley Young is another player that few would have expected to be a key part of Van Gaal's plans . Marouane Fellaini has become Manchester United's go-to player in midfielder this season . Chris Smalling has improved and despite the summer spending he remains a key aprt of the team . As for Young, who would have thought he would become one of United’s most consistent players? It just shows how Louis van Gaal works. He doesn’t care about names — he wants to pick the right person at the right time and give everyone a chance. The only potential problem would be a Michael Carrick injury. He has been instrumental in United’s revival. As for Manuel Pellegrini, I feel for him because he seems a good guy but this could be the final straw. Van Gaal doesn’t care about names — he wants to pick the right person at the right time and give  a chance . The only potential problem would be a Michael Carrick injury as he has been instrumental in United’s revival . ADDING GOALS WILL MAKE JAMES A STAR . We've heard a lot about James Ward-Prowse and he was one of my 10 players to watch at the start of the season. He is a fantastic young player with fine technique and an excellent set-piece. But it’s incredible that the penalty he scored on Saturday was only his second goal in 85 games for Southampton. He grew up idolising David Beckham and Steven Gerrard but they did not just provide, they scored too. James Ward-Prowse was one of my 10 players to watch at the start of the season and he scored this weekend . Now he has to go up a level and try and emulate his heroes by scoring goals on a regular basis. If he does that, he could well be one of the young England stars fighting for a midfield place at Euro 2016. Ward-Prowse grew up idolising David Beckham (right) and Steven Gerrard (centre), he must score like them . My tip for Ward-Prowse from August 2014 as one of my 10 players to watch this season . 1998 - The last time all three promoted teams were relegated the following season was in 1997-98. RELEGATION RIVALS . With Leicester’s last-minute win and QPR unlucky to lose against Chelsea, it’s all becoming very tight at the bottom. The three promoted teams are all in the relegation zone as it stands but I’ve got a sneaky feeling one of them will get out of it. And here’s a good omen for them. Only once before in Premier League history have all three promoted teams gone straight back down and that happened 17 seasons ago. The race is on. QPR were unlucky to lose against Chelsea but I’ve got a feeling one of the promoted teams will survive . LENNON LOOKING HAPPY AGAIN . When Aaron Lennon went on loan to Everton, his first photo shoot caused quite a stir. There was barely a hint of a smile and plenty of people wondered if he really wanted to be there. Now he looks like he’s loving life under Roberto Martinez. He is a good player, has scored a few goals and suits how Martinez wants to play. I would not be surprised if he made the switch permanent. Aaron Lennon looks like he’s loving life under Roberto Martinez and he suits the way the manager plays . CRESSWELL'S CURLER . Aaron Cresswell’s free-kick was one of the finest set-piece goals we’ve seen all season. It feels like a lot of free-kicks have gone flying in this campaign and I wondered if the referee’s vanishing spray was having a big impact. But even with the spray, which is a good addition, there hasn’t been a big change in terms of successful free-kicks, as our table shows. Aaron Cresswell’s free-kick against Stoke City was one of the finest set-piece goals we’ve seen all season . Cresswell's was good but there hasn’t been a big change in  successful free-kicks, as our table shows . 4 - In 29 games this season, Bolasie has four goals. In his last 77 Palace games he only scored three. BOLASIE STARTS TO BANG THEM IN . Yannick Bolasie has been one of the main reasons behind Crystal Palace’s incredible run of form this year. Alongside Wilfried Zaha and Jason Puncheon he has formed an incredibly potent attacking trio. Everything he does happens at blistering speed and he absolutely terrorises defenders. He’s such a tricky player and quite old-fashioned in the way he hugs the touchline and takes defenders on. But the very best wide men don’t just create goals, they score them as well. If he keeps firing them in like he did at Sunderland, then his value is only going to go up. Yannick Bolasie has been one of the main reasons behind Crystal Palace’s incredible run of form this year . HOMEGROWN STARS . Francis Coquelin and Harry Kane have been the two breakthrough players of the year and in positions where their clubs needed reinforcements. Coquelin has become such a strong presence in Arsenal’s midfield and Kane is a striking star for Spurs. It just goes to show you don’t always have to go out and spend huge money to solve a problem. The answer can be right under your nose. Harry Kane's progress goes to show you don’t always have to go out and spend huge money to solve issues . SPURS STAGNATE . That was a big win for Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane. It gave Aston Villa some vital points and he also proved a point to his old employers. But how much has really changed at Spurs? If it weren’t for Harry Kane, there would be some serious criticism heading their way — as the table below shows, they have not improved on last year. It is still a young team and they have time on their side but yet again their season is over sooner than it should be. Tim Sherwood enjoyed Aston Villa's win at White Hart Lane, it proved a point and earned vital league points . TRUE MASTERS . I was lucky enough to go Augusta this week to watch some of the golf and it was fantastic to see how hard all the players work. Plenty of footballers fancy themselves as golfers but these guys show just how dedicated you must be to be the best.","Manchester United beat Manchester City 4-2 at Old Trafford on Sunday .

"Aston Villa deserved their victory at Wembley on Sunday and there were two players at the heart of it all. Jack Grealish was fantastic but Fabian Delph was the best player on the pitch. On Saturday, I said his battle with Jordan Henderson would be key to the game. There’s no doubt who won that one. Delph was different class. He put in an all-action display and ran the game. He looked like the player we all felt he could become when he emerged at Leeds. He was outstanding. As for Grealish, for a young man to play like that on his first visit to Wembley was magnificent. Jack Grealish, Fabian Delph and Christian Benteke celebrate as Aston Villa  reached the FA Cup final . Delph shoots and scores against Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet to put Aston Villa ahead at Wembley . He is quick but has a languid style, like Steve McManaman. When he drops his shoulder he sends defenders so far the other way they almost have to pay to get back in. Tim Sherwood has done a brilliant job with Villa. I was at Wembley and their fans turned up with a sense of expectancy, something they have not had in a long time. Tim deserves huge credit for that. He has ignited that team and got their passion and excitement back. Delph and Grealish, pictured with Gabrial Agbonlahor inside the  dressing room, impressed at Wembley . Grealish is quick and has a languid style similar to former Liverpool and England star Steve McManaman . Foxes home advantage could be key . April 25 - Burnley (A) Apr 29 - Chelsea (H) May 2 - Newcastle (H) May 9 - Southampton (H) May 16 - Sunderland (A) May 24 - QPR (H) Of the three promoted teams fighting for their lives at the bottom, Leicester look the most likely to stay up. They are the form team down there right now. When you’re in a relegation scrap, nothing boosts your confidence quite like goals. That’s why Leicester have been able to drag themselves off the bottom of the table. They have scored 10 in their last four, including three at Tottenham in a game they were unlucky to lose 4-3. Now they have won three games in a row - a winning streak only Arsenal (8) and Chelsea (4) can beat. They have good pace up front with Jamie Vardy, and Leonardo Ulloa finally found his shooting boots with a goal against Swansea. The key for Leicester now is that, of their six remaining games, four of them are at home. That home advantage could be the difference between staying up or going down. Leonardo Ulloa celebrates with Leicester team-mate Esteban Cambiasso during the Foxes win over Swansea . Que sera, sera . Of course, for sentimental reasons I wanted Steven Gerrard and Liverpool to get to the final. What better way for one of Liverpool’s greatest ever players to depart the club than with an FA Cup win? It is a shame he won’t be there but he has probably achieved more at Liverpool than he would ever have dreamed of. And if there’s anybody who thinks about the team rather than himself, it’s Stevie. He will be devastated not to make the final but for the club’s sake, not his. Steven Gerrard looks dejected after Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday . Liverpool captain Gerrard will be devastated at not reaching the FA Cup final but for the club's sake, not his . Winning the FA Cup would have been the perfect send off for Gerrard who is leaving Liverpool for LA Galaxy . Chelsea just do what's needed . 1 - Chelsea have lost just one of their last 13 Premier League home games against Man Utd (3-2 in Oct 2012), winning eight and drawing four . It's difficult to be critical of a side like Chelsea. They have an incredible record at home and an uncanny ability to win the big games. That’s exactly what happened against Man United on Saturday. People say it was a tactical masterplan to play Kurt Zouma in midfield to stop Marouane Fellaini. I’m not so sure. Yes, Fellaini has been effective in recent weeks but I don’t think we’ve got to the stage where he needs to be man-marked. Chelsea are a good enough team to beat United without resorting to that. But you cannot argue with the results. Chelsea have developed a ruthless, efficient style. Since losing to Spurs on New Year’s Day they are unbeaten in the league. In their last two games they have had three shots on target. Two of them have gone in and they have won both games 1-0. That’s how to grind out a title. The United game was Jose Mourinho’s 102nd clean sheet out of 190 games in the Premier League. He knows exactly what’s needed to bring home the trophies. No wonder Roman Abramovich looked so delighted after the final whistle. Kurt Zouma (right) and Marouane Fellaini battle for the ball during Chelsea's 1-0 victory over Man United . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho knows how to grind out a title and has kept 102 clean sheets in 190 matches . Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich shows his delight in the stands at Stamford Bridge during Saturday's win . Pressure's on for Arsenal . I’m sure most neutrals wanted to see Arsenal play Liverpool in the FA Cup final, and plenty of Arsenal fans will be happy to see Villa there instead. But they will have to be careful. Against Wigan and Hull last year, and Reading this time around, Arsenal have made hard work of these games. The pressure will be all on them and they will have to compete with the energy of that Villa midfield. It will certainly make for another absorbing final. Arsenal celebrate during the win over Reading but will have to be careful against Villa in the FA Cup final . Burnley must keep believing . April 25 - Leicester (H) May 2 - West Ham (A) May 9 - Hull (A) May 16 - Stoke (H) May 24 - Aston Villa (A) For Sean Dyche and his side, their season starts now. Burnley have been on a poor run and another defeat this weekend has added to their worries. They have only scored one goal in their last seven games, although that was a significant winner against Manchester City. But that is a desperate drought that has seen them sink right to the bottom of the table. Their top scorer Danny Ings has not scored since February though it has been difficult for him — I’m sure he’s got other things on his mind with so much speculation about his future. He has had a decent season but he has suffered from a lack of support and that is a problem. Burnley's top scorer Danny Ings has not scored since February and has not suffered from a lack of support . Only two other Burnley players have scored more than twice all season - George Boyd and Ashley Barnes with five each. It’s hard to see where their next goal is coming from. But for Dyche the fixture list has been kind. Some of their relegation rivals have still got to face the top sides but the highest-placed team Burnley have to face are Stoke in ninth. Dyche and his team only have five games left but there’s no reason why they can’t get something from each one of them. Burnley players look dejected following Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Everton and are not bottom of the table . Awards season . 4 - Kane is only the fourth Tottenham player to score 20+ goals in a Premier League season after Gareth Bale, Jurgen Klinsmann and Teddy Sheringham. I have said throughout the second half of the season that the Player of the Year award will be between Eden Hazard and Harry Kane. Diego Costa, Sergio Aguero and Alexis Sanchez have all done well but those two have been consistently excellent. Over the last six games there’s no doubt Hazard’s performances should have that contest wrapped up. He has been nothing short of brilliant in the games that really matter. Kane has been the best thing about Tottenham’s season. He has rescued their front line and I would be amazed if he doesn’t win Young Player of the Year. I prefer watching attacking players doing exciting things and he has done that all season. He came from nowhere and he has been one of the stories of the year.

"After a weekend when special goals were the norm in the Premier League, it's not an easy task to pick the best of the bunch. From Jermain Defoe's match-winning volley in the Tyne-Wear derby on Sunday, to Charlie Adam's audacious long-range effort against Chelsea on Saturday evening, there's plenty to choose from. Here, Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp picks his top five goals of the weekend and explains why they've made his list. 5. Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal) vs Liverpool . I can't believe I have to make this goal No 5 in my list. It just shows the calibre of the goals scored this weekend. The Chilean took a brilliant first touch before spinning to lash it home and cap a fine Arsenal move — and a breathless first half. Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez puts the Gunners 3-0 up against Liverpool at the Emirates on Saturday . The Chilean runs off to celebrate after beating Simon Mignolet from outside the Liverpool area .

Like Defoe's, it was a hugely important goal for his team and part of a superb performance.

Any other week and this would be being talked about in the same breath as Wayne's overhead kick against City. To flick it up with one foot, pivot and then hit it with your other is as difficult a skill as you could wish to see, but he made it look effortless.

"Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with his latest column for Sportsmail. The Barnet manager talks about how important it is for the troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season. TAKING THE BISCUIT . Just a few days ago an old friend of mine Jimmy Carter, the winger who played for Millwall, Liverpool and Arsenal not the US President, visited Barnet and left me a nice packet of milk chocolate biscuits in my office. After training, to help me get rid of them, I decided to give some out to our players. The first seven who walked past my office door were called in for a cup of PG Tips and a chat. I asked each one to take a biscuit and pass the pack on, around the group. I kept repeating it, each time: Take one and pass it on, take one and pass it on. One player didn’t want a biscuit and simply passed the packet on. Martin Allen believes it is important for troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season. I stopped them in their tracks and asked him why he hadn’t taken a biscuit. This was an opportunity to point out how important it is to follow the coach’s direction. I didn’t tell them to eat it - I told them to take one and pass the pack on. The other six were looking at their biscuits waiting for the go ahead. I passed the packet back to the player and he now took his biscuit. I let them all know they could eat if they like, and if not return it to my desk, and shook all their hands as they left the room. When it comes to this crucial stage in the season, you need all your troops ready to follow orders. IT’S A ZAYN IF THEY’RE NOT PULLING IN ONE DIRECTION . At whatever level it’s always important to have all your players going in One Direction. Just like the band, if you’ve got one person wanting to go a different way, do a different thing, something is going to crack and the team ethic and unity will be broken. At the business end of the season, it is so important that they are working as a team. People have to do their jobs; defending set plays, defensive shape when you’re attacking, working up and down the pitch. You need good captains and leaders within your group. People like John Terry, who not only does his job but also makes sure each and every person in that Chelsea squad follows Jose Mourinho’s guidance out on the pitch. It is One Direction, or no direction. Captain John Terry works hard to ensure everybody at Chelsea is heading in the same direction . ON THE PERIPHERY . Having good players in your first team is obviously vitally important. But the players out of the team, on the periphery, can lose you matches. Negative body language, people unable to cope with not playing, disruptive comments, and a dismissive look about everything you say and do can infect the whole squad. The man-management of these players on the edge of the first team is crucial and the skills needed they do not teach you on the UEFA Pro Licence or courses put on by the Football Association. I’ve spent the last three-and-a-half years working with a guy called Rob Northfield, who runs Inspire based up in Harrogate, on man-management skills for my players, my staff and of course myself. He deals with chief executives of the infamous banks and building societies. Allen won a championship with Gillingham and is hoping to soon do the same with Barnet . Since then, I have one championship in the bag at Gillingham and hopefully by the end of this month would’ve bagged a second. Without Rob Northfields this would not have happened. Mourinho is a coach who is so good at dealing with players who are on the bench and not always in the side. He knows at some point in the season he will need them and they are always fighting for him. Players on the periphery can make the difference between winning and losing. Allen’s Analysis… . One person I keep hearing about… Gary Rowett Gary Rowett is winning so many games and doing so well at Birmingham City. He has steered them in the right direction after their poor start to the season in the Championship. He did a tremendous job at Burton Albion and back then there was no doubt in my mind, having played against his teams over the last couple of years, he would go on to manage at a much higher level. He must've asked me at least one hundred questions when my Gillingham team visited Burton the week after winning the championship. He was like Bamber Gascoigne, the old University Challenge presenter - non-stop firing questions at me. He was listening to the answers and asking intelligent questions about how we managed to win the league with Gillingham from a team that had previously been mid-table. For me, he’s heading for the top. Allen believes Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett is going to go all the way to the top . One thing I’d change about… perceptions in football . At Barnet last summer, I found myself with no staff and a need to recruit new people. I took on Jon Nurse, born in Barbados, as a player-coach. I was impressed when he told me how when he was a teenager he lost his mum and he had the responsibility to bring up his younger brother. On top of that he got a degree in computer networking and played more than 300 league games, winning a promotion, the FA Trophy and been in numerous playoff finals. He also has a UEFA B coaching licence and a schoolboy skills training academy called Love The Ball. I took on another player-coach, goalkeeper Graham Stack, an Irishman, who has four impeccably behaved children, who runs the Graham Stack Soccer Academy for youngsters and a high-end executive travel company with his wife, who can build patios and brick walls alongside his UEFA B coaching licence. Former Arsenal goalkeeper Graham Stack has been working alongside Allen as a coach at Barnet . Then I was introduced to a young man called Omar Yabroudi who moved to London from Dubai and wanted to be my analyst. He works hard and has been a real help. He works for virtually nothing and has fitted in superbly. We have a 23-year-old female physiotherapist, Jade Cook, who had only worked with our youth team before but she has stepped up to work with the first team for the first time. She is calm, quiet, well-organised, disciplined, structured and I am very happy all the players are being so well looked after. I did not take on a Barbadian, an Irishman, an Emirati or a female because of their nationality, or skin colour or gender. I took them on because they’re good at their jobs, they are good people, with good personalities and they have excellent characters. I’m very proud of all of them in their first year working for me and no doubt all four will go on to work at the top level in the Premier League. Without them we would not have been top of the Conference for so long. The big issue… England coming out of the dark ages. When I was a little boy watching England versus Poland in the front room with my dad, the amazing Jan Tomaszewski, who Brian Clough called a ‘clown in gloves,’ stopped England qualifying for the 1974 World Cup with his heroic performance in goal. The panel of pundits, all those years ago, said we’ve got to change. We’re not playing the type of football other countries play; our children don’t get coached to be good technical players like other nations. Over the years I’ve heard it time and time again. The same old stuff. Especially over the last few years with the Spanish dominance, people asking why we have not got the Iniestas and Xavis of this world on our shores. Allen believes Greg Dyke is the man to help find the Iniestas and Xavis of the English game . The Football Association’s technical director now, Dan Ashworth, appointed by my old chairman Greg Dyke, is a forward-thinker who can finally make some changes. He may never have played a professional game in his life, but at West Bromwich Albion he implemented a modern football structure at the club, where the manager does not have to deal with everything, where other departments and professionals are involved. Greg Dyke speaks to Premier League chief Richard Scudamore ahead of his FA council meeting . Ashworth can handle himself well. At a League Managers Association training day a couple of years, at a hotel near Reading, one Sunday afternoon, speaking just before Fabio Capello, Ashworth faced a roomful of sceptical, old-fashioned managers that thought they knew best and thought they knew the way forward. The gave him a torrid time with their caveman-like mentality that the manager should run the whole club. He handled the room carefully and skilfully and I think Greg Dyke has put English football into the right hands. He is the right man to take England back for their second World Cup win.","Martin Allen believes it's a crucial time for troops to follow orders .

"It's been a frustrating few weeks but at our end we are trying everything we can to make the fight that everyone in this country wants to see – Scott Quigg against Carl Frampton. You'll have seen by now that we have offered Frampton £1.5million for the fight – all he has to do is turn up, we will take all the risks. If there's more we can do to make this fight happen then I don't know what it is. Now it is up to Frampton and his people to decide if they really want it. If they do, cash the cheque and come to the Manchester Arena on July 18. Scott Quigg is desperate to fight Carl Frampton and has offered him £1.5million to do so on July 18 . Promoter Eddie Hearn produced a cheque for £1.5m live on television on Tuesday . I hope they do because I really can't understand what is stopping them. All the risk is on our side. I have fronted up this money and Scott is the one who might earn less. If this only generates average pay-per-view numbers then he might only make a third of what Frampton is getting. Personally, I think it will do big numbers and then Scott will probably get about the same as Frampton. It was interesting to see the Cyclone (Frampton's promoters) statement shortly after. They said this fight can only happen if they are co-promoters. Why, if we are the ones putting the money up? If it matters that much to them to have their name on the poster or Michael Buffer read their name out before the fight then I don't have a problem with that either. The fact is it's not about Cyclone or Matchroom, it's about Scott Quigg and Carl Frampton. Frampton made the first defence of his world title against Chris Avalos in February . In any case, Scott will fight on July 18 at Manchester Arena. I have held talks with both Nonito Donaire, the Filipino sensation, and Kiko Martinez. Both are former world champions and both are brilliant fights. Scott has options but he knows the biggest fight in the super-bantamweight division is a unification against Frampton. That is why we are busting a gut to make it happen. Now the ball is in Frampton's court. It is looking very likely at the moment that Kell Brook will fight on my May 30 card at the O2 Arena. With Kevin Mitchell and Lee Selby fighting for world titles and Anthony Joshua taking on Kevin Johnson, the addition of Kell will make this one of the very best cards this country has seen in years. Many have called for a fight between the IBF's No 5 ranked fighter Frankie Gavin to face Kell. I can tell you it is a fight that we are considering very closely. Kell Brook looks set to make a quick return to the ring with an appearance on May 30 at the O2 Arena . It's been an interesting few months for Frankie. In November he won the British and Commonwealth titles against Bradley Skeete and now his options look like a fight for the IBF international title against Chris van Heerden, an IBF title eliminator against Timothy Bradley, or a straight fight against the holder, who happens to be Kell. As his promoter, I can't see the merit in him going to America to fight Bradley if Kell is an option on May 30. And believe me, it is an option we are looking at closely. Frankie Gavin could challenge Brook for his world title in London in an all-British showdown . The public, more than anything, like an all-British fight. And every 10 minutes since we signed Frankie he has been asking for a fight with Kell. As Kell says, it is nice to see a British fighter with the balls to fight him. Josh Warrington is in action in Leeds this weekend. The unbeaten Leeds featherweight is up against Dennis Tubieron for the vacant WBC international title and it is his first real step towards a world title. This kid is brilliant inside and out of the ring. One of the highlights of my job has been watching him and Lee Selby moving towards each other. If Selby wins the world title against Evgeny Gradovich on May 30, as I believe he will, then the stage will be set for a huge world title fight between Selby and Warrington in 2016. Josh Warrington bids to continue his rise when he takes on Dennis Tubieron in Leeds on Saturday . Anthony Joshua marches on. He destroyed Jason Gavern on Saturday, making it 11 fights, 11 wins and 11 knockouts. Considering he has endured a lengthy lay-off with a stress fracture in his back, I could not have been happier. People have questioned the opponent but Gavern is a guy who went four rounds with Deontay Wilder in his 32nd fight last year. That is not to make a comparison with Joshua and Wilder, but more to show that in beating Gavern in three rounds there should not be any doubts about what was a worrying injury. Anthony Joshua made it 11 stoppage wins from as many fights when he beat Jason Gavern in Newcastle . Joshua is likely to fight in Birmingham on May 9 before taking on Kevin Johnson three weeks later . We will now carry on full speed with a guy who I am convinced will soon be a world champion. I am looking to get him out again on May 9 in Birmingham and should have more information on that soon. Then he will face Kevin Johnson at the O2 Arena on May 30 and from there we are looking at the likes of Dillian Whyte, Dereck Chisora and David Price. Beyond that you have Tyson Fury and David Haye. I'd expect those fights to be ticked off in the next 12 months. People want to see him fight the best now. But this is a process and we have a plan. The huge fights are coming up and I'd back him to look absolutely devastating.","Scott Quigg and I have taken all the risks - Carl Frampton must step up .

"Aston Villa take on Liverpool in their FA Cup semi-final encounter on Sunday with the competition both sides' last chance to win any silverware this season. Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp looks ahead to the Wembley showdown and where the match could be won and lost with individual player duels. CHRISTIAN BENTEKE v MARTIN SKRTEL . This will be a heavyweight contest that could decide the game. Christian Benteke is superb in the air and Martin Skrtel will have his hands full. Liverpool have to stop the supply line because defending crosses has been their Achilles heel this season. Christian Benteke (centre) scored the only goal of the game as Villa won 1-0 at Tottenham on April 11 . Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel (right) will have his hands full trying to stop Benteke on Sunday afternoon . FABIAN DELPH v JORDAN HENDERSON . This should be a good contest between two England team-mates. Fabian Delph’s new deal was a real boost for Villa - he drives that midfield, though he doesn’t get enough goals. You used to say the same about Jordan Henderson but he has improved so much. England international Fabian Delph (left) and Jordan Henderson are set for a midfield battle at Wembley . RAHEEM STERLING v RON VLAAR and NATHAN BAKER . Ron Vlaar and Nathan Baker make an imposing back line but they would rather be up against a Benteke than a Raheem Sterling, who will float around and make himself difficult to mark so he can use his lightning pace to get in behind them. Raheem Sterling's (left) pace and trickery is bound to cause the Villa defence a lot of problems .

"Saturday's game is absolutely huge for both teams. Win and Arsenal go second to put huge pressure on Manchester City. Lose and Liverpool will be nine points behind Arsene Wenger’s side. It’s a vital match and here’s where the game can be won and lost. OLIVIER GIROUD v KOLO TOURE/MAMADOU SAKHO . With no Martin Skrtel, Olivier Giroud will be licking his lips. Kolo Toure and Mamadou Sakho are both solid enough but they are nervous in possession and they will miss the experience and physicality of Skrtel. If Dejan Lovren is fit, I expect him to play, but if not, don’t be surprised if Giroud gets on the scoresheet. The Frenchman is in excellent form this season but the only question mark against him was does he score enough in the big games? So far in this campaign, he has scored against Manchester United, City and Liverpool. He will want to continue that run on Saturday. Martin Skrtel (centre) misses the trip to Arsenal after getting a three-game ban for stamping on David de Gea . Kolo Toure (centre) and Mamadou Sakho (right) are in contention to replace Skrtel for Saturday's clash . Whichever defender plays, they are in for a tough afternoon against in-form Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud . PER MERTESACKER v DANIEL STURRIDGE . I’ve lost count of the number of times I have covered Arsenal games and wondered how Per Mertesacker does it. It always amazes me that teams don’t try and get pacey players in and around him more often. He’s never been blessed with speed and playing a high line can cause him problems, but he has a World Cup medal to his name, so he must be doing something right. His partner Laurent Koscielny is much more mobile, so a fit-again Daniel Sturridge as well as Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho will hope to exploit Mertesacker’s side of the defence. Germany World Cup-winner Per Mertesacker (right) is expected line-up in defence for Arsenal . However, Mertesacker's lack of pace could be exposed if Daniel Sturridge (right) is fit to start for Liverpool . AARON RAMSEY vs JORDAN HENDERSON . This time last year if you asked people who they would rather have in their team, it would be Aaron Ramsey all day long. But Jordan Henderson has come so far it is now a 50-50 call. These are the midfield marathon men and whoever wins this battle in the engine room should end up on the winning side. Ramsey can grab a goal, and Liverpool will have to watch his runs into the box, but Henderson will press hard and make sure Ramsey and the likes of Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla have no room to breathe. Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey (left) midfield battle with Liverpool's Jordan Henderson should prove a close affair .","Arsenal host Liverpool in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon .

"On Friday night I’ll be wearing Bath’s No 6 shirt for the second time in a Premiership game. The switch from midfield has worked for myself and the team, so I’m hoping I can carry on playing in the back row for the rest of this season. The change of position was a decision my head coach, Mike Ford, made after the Champions Cup quarter-final against Leinster. He phoned me a day after that game to discuss playing me in the back row to maximize my on-field minutes in our run home, to what I call ‘the big dance’: that’s the finals. He thought No 6 would suit the way we are trying to play as a team and also suit my personal strengths and I agreed. Sam Burgess is set to start at blindside flanker for the second time for Bath on Friday night . Bath head coach Mike Ford believes Burgess will make a bigger impact on the game from the backrow . Burgess is still adapting to the 15-man code with his ball-carrying technique coming under scrutiny . In league, for nine years, my game has been about taking short balls and looking for holes. At Bath, that is what our forwards do, so moving into the pack makes sense and allows me more time on the field, which is what I need to keep improving my union brain. We’ve got, hopefully, five weeks left in the Premiership and if all goes well I will stay at six, but I don’t want to be pigeon-holed. I’ve found that has happened a lot since I switched codes. Whether I’m playing at 12, playing at 13 or playing at six, to me, it doesn’t make much difference to my attitude. I’ve found only subtle differences between the positions. Despite enjoying playing at flanker, I have not given up on a centre spot in my future in the game. I had a go at six earlier in the season in a couple of A-league games, but obviously that is not the same standard. Now, I feel more comfortable at the breakdown than I did a few months ago and I’m even getting to grips with the line-out. Burgess began his union career in the centre but is set to finish the season as a back rower . I find myself on the ball more, but I was disappointed by a few dropped balls. I never seemed to drop the ball as much in league! We’re addressing that now — my technique going into contact can improve. In union, you can contest for the ball more in the tackle than you can in league, so I’ve had to adapt a bit. I was maybe leading with the ball a bit too much. Another subtle difference between the codes is that in union players throw spin passes whereas in league, I was used to end-over-end passes. Now I’ve played in two positions, it is interesting to compare them. When I was in midfield, I thought that being a back was tougher and now I am in the pack, I realise that the forwards are the ones putting in the hard yards, but I’m sure if I go back into the backline, I’ll change my mind again! It was a great experience to spend time with the England squad. Burgess makes a strong carry during Bath's European Champions Cup clash with Montpellier in December . It was fantastic for me to rub shoulders with those players and pick up a few tips. I didn’t go in there with any mind-set other than to be myself and enjoy spending time with players I wouldn’t normally get to sit down and have a brew with. Training was intense and I enjoyed it. You never know when the opportunity will come round again, so I just tried to make the most of it. Stuart (Lancaster) wants me to do well in the game and wants me to be around the top players in that environment as much as possible, which is great. The former rugby league superstar spent time with Stuart Lancaster's England squad during the Six Nations . He just told me to keep doing what I’ve been doing. Obviously he has some pretty tough decisions to make, but he was pretty straight-up with me about where I stood. He told me I wouldn’t be part of those Six Nations matches, but he was very happy with how I’m going. I was at the last game against France. It was a great day for the sport and showed how freely people can play when the situation allows it. The atmosphere was unbelievable and the other players I spoke to said it was probably the best atmosphere they had ever experienced at Twickenham. Burgess was recently linked with move back to the NRL with Manly where his brother Luke (pictured) plays . That’s why I’m here; to be around that sort of atmosphere and to test myself on the best stage. It would have been wonderful to be part of that game. At around that time there were rumours in Australia that Manly wanted me back in the NRL. My brother, Luke, is there and suddenly my name was being mentioned, but anyone who knows my personality knows that there’s no way I would go back until I have given it a very good crack in union. For now, I’ll keep giving my best in that Bath No 6 shirt. Sam Burgess is a Canterbury ambassador and face of the Since 1904 fashion collection.
