"An Oregon man adopted from South Korea as a toddler fears that he could be torn away from his wife and three children because his U.S. citizenship was never registered. Adam Crapser, 39, of Salem, was issued with deportation papers by the Department of Homeland Security in January and a hearing is set for April 2. The father-of-three, who has a fourth child on the way, arrived in America with the name Shin Sonh Hyuk in 1979 around the age of three along with his biological sister. However, his first set of adoptive parents abandoned him and the second set turned out to be abusive. Adding to Crapser's struggles, at no point did his guardians seek the green card or citizenship for him that they should have. Deportation fears: Korean adoptee Adam Crapser, left, poses with daughters, Christal, one, Christina, five, and his wife, Anh Nguyen, in the family's living room in Oregon . Now,  after a life battling joblessness because of his lack of immigration papers, homelessness and crime, Crapser is facing deportation. 'The state abandoned him when he was a child,' his attorney, Lori Walls, said. 'Now the US is throwing him out.' Federal immigration officials say they became aware of Crapser after he applied to renew his green card two years ago: his criminal convictions, ranging from burglary to assault, made him potentially deportable under immigration law. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement wasn't aware of Crapser's childhood adoption history when it decided to pursue his deportation, agency spokesman Andrew Munoz said. Two U.S. senators, including Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, are proposing a stand-alone, automatic citizenship bill for adoptees like Crapser. Growing pains: This undated photo provided by Crapser shows him around the age of three with his sister . Struggles: Abandoned by one adoptive family, separated for nearly three decades from his only biological sister, and exposed to abuse by another American adoptive couple, Crapser struggled with rejection, homelessness and crime . 'It was not his responsibility to fill out that immigration paperwork,' Merkley said. 'He knows no other country.' Advocates say thousands of adoptees don't know they aren't citizens until they, for example, try to get a job. The federal government does not track the citizenship status of international adoptees or how many have faced deportation. The State Department says it is aware of adult adoptees who are in immigration removal proceedings. Adoptees who didn't become citizens are lawful permanent residents - but they lack the documents to prove it. Their stories about deportation to countries as diverse as India, Russia or Brazil are detailed on advocacy websites. Many of them remained stuck in legal limbo. A provision that would make citizenship automatic for all international adoptees regardless of age was added to a Senate immigration bill several years ago. But when reform stalled, the provision did, too. Since the 1950s, American couples have adopted nearly half a million children from other countries; about 100,000 of those children came from South Korea. For years, it was the parents' responsibility to seek citizenship, but many did not. In 2000, lawmakers made citizenship automatic for international adoptees, but the law wasn't retroactive. It excluded adoptees 18 or older at the time. Crapser wouldn't have met the criteria. Seven years after Crapser and his sister were adopted, their parents abandoned them. The foster care system separated Crapser, ten at the time, from his sister, whom he was dependent on, according to orphanage records. The boy bounced through several foster and group homes. When Crapser was 12, he moved in with Thomas and Dolly Crapser, their biological son, two other adoptees and several foster children. The next four years, Adam Crapser said, the couple choked, kicked and hit him and the other children every day, slammed them against walls, set dogs to attack them and burned them with hot objects. Still in limbo: Crapser  poses with daughter, Christal, one,  in the family's living room . 'Everything I did was wrong,' he said. 'As far as humiliation goes, I have been there.' His father also used racial epithets to address him and forced him to forget Korea. 'He always told me I'm American, and that I need to let go of my past,' Adam Crapser said. In 1991, the couple was arrested on charges of physical child abuse, sexual abuse and rape. They denied the charges. Thomas Crapser's sentence included 90 days in jail, and his wife's three years of probation. Because students at his high school teased him about the abuse, Adam Crapser said he dropped out of 9th grade. He became homeless and slept in a shelter or the back of an old car while working several fast food jobs and finishing his high school equivalency diploma at night. The Crapsers had not obtained U.S. citizenship papers for him. Over the next few years, Adam Crapser struggled alone, and also got into trouble with the law. Once it was after he broke into his parents' home - it was, he said, to retrieve the Korean Bible and rubber shoes that came with him from the orphanage - and later it was for stealing cars and assaulting a roommate. Because he lacked a green card to prove he could work in the U.S., he opened a barber shop and an upholstery business - something he could do without immigration papers. He said his parents withheld his adoption record for years, so it wasn't until 2012 that Adam Crapser submitted a green card application - which set in motion his path to a deportation hearing. Adam Crapser said he takes full responsibility for his crimes, but he has 'done his time' and changed his life. 'America promised me a home,' he wrote in his court declaration. 'I implore this country to keep its promise. If not for me then for my children, so they won't have to grow up without a dad.'","Adam Crapser, 39, was issued with deportation papers by the Department of Homeland Security in January and a hearing is set for April 2 .

"Pictures of the Australian man reportedly facing the death penalty for smuggling ice in China have emerged. The man, Ibrahim Jalloh, along with another Australian, Bengali Sherrif, were reportedly arrested at Guangzhou Airport in June 2014. Sherrif has already been sentenced to death, according to the ABC. Australian man Ibrahim Jalloh is awaiting trial after reportedly being arrested attempting to smuggle drugs in China . They were allegedly in possession of a substantial quantity of ice. It is believed Sherrif’s sentence could be reduced to life in prison if it is decided he has been well-behaved during his first two years in prison. Jalloh’s trial is reportedly yet to commence. The young man arrived in Australia from Sierra Leone with his mother, three sisters and brother eight years ago. Australian citizen Bengali Sherrif has reportedly been sentenced to death after he and Queensland man Ibrahim Jalloh were arrested at Guangzhou airport (pictured) in June 2014 . Daily Mail Australia contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but it did not comment on the alleged case. 'A number of Australians are currently facing narcotics-related charges in China,' a spokeswoman said. 'All are either under investigation or awaiting trial or verdicts. For privacy reasons, we will not disclose details of individual cases.' The arrests were mentioned in a Melbourne Court last week where three men face trial, accused of being embroiled in a drug ring importing drugs to Australia from China. Queensland men Sam Komba, 20, and Foday Kamara, 29, both face one charge of conspiring to import a controlled substance, according to ABC. The two Australians were allegedly in possession of a substantial quantity of ice (stock picture) Melbourne man Wedi Bembo is charged with the same offence. He also faces an additional charge over an alleged heroin importation in 2013. Jalloh’s brother Chiwto told the court that the accused had travelled to China in the belief he was picking up passports allegedly under the orders of Sam Bembo, according to ABC. Chiwto reportedly said their mother was devastated when she received a call to say Ibrahim had instead been arrested for drug trafficking. Komba, Kamar and Bembo’s trials will be held in October.

"Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist. He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear. Scroll down for video . Mystery: This painting depicts Jesus Christ as single person but writer David Fitzgerald believes he was a literary invention that combined the stories from several cults and figures in Judea during the first century . He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus. Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence. Historical researcher Michael Paulkovich has claimed that Jesus of Nazareth did not exist after being unable to find any verifiable mention of Christ in historical texts by 126 writers during the ‘time of Jesus’ from the first to third centuries. He claims that he is a fictional character invented by followers of Christianity to create a figure to worship. He says this is surprising despite his ‘global miracles and alleged worldwide fame.’ The 126 texts he studied were all written in the period during or soon after the supposed existence of Jesus, when Paulkovich says they would surely have heard of someone as famous as Jesus - but none mention him. 'When I consider those 126 writers, all of whom should have heard of Jesus but did not - and Paul and Marcion and Athenagoras and Matthew with a tetralogy of opposing Christs, the silence from Qumram and Nazareth and Bethlehem, conflicting Bible stories, and so many other mysteries and omissions - I must conclude that Christ is a mythical character,’ he writes. ‘""Jesus of Nazareth"" was nothing more than urban (or desert) legend, likely an agglomeration of several evangelic and deluded rabbis who might have existed.’ In a new book due to be published later this year, he will argue that the figure of Jesus was actually a combination of pagan rituals and stories about other people. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. 'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all. 'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray. 'I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted. 'Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith. 'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different ""Lord's suppers"" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs. 'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus.' Mr Fitzgerald, whose first book 'Nailed: Ten Christian Myths that Show Jesus Never Existed at All' was published in 2010, believes it is no longer reasonable to assume there has to be a single historic figure who began Christianity. Instead he says early Christians drew upon the beliefs and rituals of other cults and faiths around in the first century. He argues that John the Baptist's cult is one such example and had initially been a competitor to the cult of Jesus before being incorporated into the Christian story. Mr Fitzgerald says there are inconsistencies in the Gospels of the Christian bible (pictured above) that suggest Jesus Christ was a literary allegory and these accounts were written decades after his supposed life . The statue of Christ the Redeemer (above) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is one of many depictions of Jesus but Mr Fitzgerald says that many of the early depictions were unable to agree on his appearance . Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all. 'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria. 'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record. 'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did.' The earliest mention of Jesus yet to be discovered is a limestone ossuary on which the words 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' is inscribed. The box, which has been dated to 64AD - several decades after the crucifixion - was seized by the Israeli Antiquities Authority and its owner arrested for forgery in 2003. Although he was later cleared in 2012, doubts about the authenticity of the inscription remain. Others have said there could have been several people named James, whose father was called Joseph and had a brother called Jesus living in Jerusalem at the time. The James Ossuary (above) is thought by some to be the first mention of Jesus in an inscription on its side . There are three mentions of Jesus in non-Christian sources which have been used to research the existence of a 'real' Jesus. A Jesus is mentioned in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, which was written around 94 AD. Rather than being born in a stable to a carpenter father, Jesus was actually the son of a successful, middle-class and highly intellectual architect. This claim comes from biblical scholar Dr Adam Bradford, who also says that between the ages of 12 and 30 - the so-called 'missing years' of Jesus' life, when little is known about him - he was studying at religious schools and became the highest-ranking rabbi in Judea. The radical revision of Christian history would suggest that, in preaching the spurning of worldly possessions for an austere life, Jesus may have been speaking from experience. Dr Bradford has analysed the Bible's original Greek and Hebrew scriptures to try to establish the truth about Christ's background. He says a mistranslation of the Greek word 'tekton' to describe the profession of Joseph, Jesus's father, is one of many mistakes that have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Christ's character. Dr Bradford claims that while 'tekton' is usually said to mean carpenter, it more accurately means master builder or architect. As an architect, Joseph would have had a higher social status that enabled him to better educate his son. Roman historian Tacitus later mentions Christ and his execution with Pontius Pilate in his Annals, thought to be written around 116AD. Both mentions were a considerable time after his alleged execution. Mr Fritzgerald also takes issue with many of the stories about the Crucifixion that stem from the first Gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke. He said: 'There are many examples of inconsistencies in the gospels that suggest they were written by people who did not live in Judea at the time they are set. 'Mark makes many mistakes about life and geography during the first century in Judea. 'If Jesus really had been arrested on the eve of Passover, they would probably have just put him in jail and tried him after the weekend. 'The trial itself violates the rules of Jewish law - why was he not stoned? 'What we know about Pontius Pilate also suggests he was someone who would not do what the Jews asked him and would often do what they asked him not to. 'Instead Mark portrays him as being persuaded by the Jewish leaders to execute him.' Mr Fitzgerald argues that many of these stories were in fact incorporated into the story of Christ as literary devices rather than as a historical account. He said: 'There is also no evidence for the tradition that sees Barabbas - an anti-Roman rebel and murderer - being released while Jesus, an innocent, is condemned to death. 'What this actually seems to be is Mark using the story as an allegory for the Yom Kippur scapegoat ritual where one goat is released into the wilderness and the other is sacrificed for God.' Mr Fitzgerald hopes to have his new book 'Jesus: Mything in Action' out later this year. He added: 'It still puzzles me that as soon as anyone tries to pin down who Jesus is we get 50 different Jesus's emerging. There is no consensus.'","Atheist writer David Fitzgerald claims there is no evidence Jesus existed .

"The Afghan Taliban has published a bizarre biography of their 'charismatic' supreme leader Mullah Omar - praising the one-eyed terrorist's 'special' sense of humour and love of grenade launchers. In a clear attempt to counter the growing influence of ISIS in the central Asian country, the Taliban propaganda release lavished praise on the extremist in celebration of his 19th year as leader. The Taliban have reportedly seen defections to ISIS recently, with some insurgents expressing their disaffection with the one-eyed warrior-cleric who has not been seen since the 2001 US-led invasion. The biography, posted just after midnight on the Taliban's main website, described Mullah Omar as being actively involved in 'jihadi activities', dispelling speculation that he died long ago. 'Special sense of humour': In a clear attempt to counter the growing influence of ISIS in Afghanistan, the Taliban propaganda release lavished praise on the one-eyed extremist (pictured left and right) Weapon of choice: The Taliban's bizarre biography of their 'charismatic' supreme leader Mullah Omar praises the one-eyed terrorist's 'special' sense of humour and love of grenade launchers (pictured) Despite being 'regularly tracked by the enemy, no major change and disruption has been observed in the routine works of [Mullah Omar] in... organising the jihadi activities as the leader of the Islamic Emirate,' it said. 'He keenly follows and inspects the... activities against the brutal infidel foreign invaders.' Lionising the militant's 'charismatic personality', the biography also contained several anecdotes of battlefield valour and described the RPG-7 grenade launcher as his 'preferred weapon of choice'. The enigmatic, remote figure has not made a public appearance since the 2001 invasion, and has hardly ever been photographed. The US State Department - which has a $10 million bounty on his head - only describes him as a tall male with a shrapnel wound to the right eye. Enemies: The Taliban (pictured) have reportedly seen defections to ISIS recently, with some insurgents expressing their disaffection with Mullah Omar who has not been seen since the 2001 US-led invasion . Jihadi rivalry: The Taliban clearly fears the growing influence within its ranks of the Islamic State - the terrorist organisation led by Iraqi extremist and self-appointed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) The Taliban's surprise move to release his richly-detailed biography, even describing his personal and family life, took security analysts by surprise. 'The Taliban have posted Omar's biography for several strategic reasons - the most important of which is to counter Daesh influence in their ranks,' said Ahmad Sayedi, an expert on the Taliban, alluding to the Arabic abbreviation for the Islamic State terror group. 'This announcement is also meant to show that Omar is alive and well and still in control as the supreme leader of the Taliban.' In the past 13 years, Omar has stayed completely out of the public eye amid growing power struggles within the Taliban and fears of ISIS' influence in their ranks as an ideological rival. The Afghan government has also raised the ominous prospect of ISIS making inroads into the country, though the group that has taken over swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria has never formally acknowledged having a presence in Afghanistan. In February a US-led NATO drone strike killed a former Taliban commander and a Guantanamo detainee suspected of links to ISIS in the volatile southern province of Helmand. Former fighters: Three former Taliban members carry their weapons during a handover as they join a government peace and reconciliation process at a ceremony in Herat . A US Department of Defense image obtained from November 2001 shows a leaflet the US were then dropping in Afghanistan showing pictures of Taliban leader Mullah Omar with the warning 'We are watching!' Mullah Abdul Rauf Khadim, who led around 300 men, had reportedly defected from the Taliban to join ISIS. The whereabouts of Omar remain a mystery but he is believed to be leading the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan from a hiding place somewhere in Pakistan. The news comes as Afghanistan's senior Shiite community leader said ISIS was responsible for kidnapping dozens of Shiite men and boys in February. Mohammad Mohaqiq said two former Taliban leaders, who switched allegiance to ISIS, were responsible for the abduction of 31 members of the minority Shiite Hazara community on February 24 in southern Zabul province. It is the first time an Afghan leader has confirmed ISIS involvement in the kidnappings.","Taliban militants have lavished praise on their enigmatic supreme leader .

"Boko Haram fighters  have been murdering dozens of young women and girls they had taken as 'wives' and using children as 'expendable cannon fodder', the U.N.'s human rights chief said today. As the Islamist militant group has retreated from parts of northeastern Nigeria, 'gruesome scenes of mass graves and further evident signs of slaughter,' has been brought to light, Zeid Raad al-Hussein told a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. Boko Haram's reported use of children as shields and human bombs would, if confirmed, constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, he said. Scroll down for video . 'War criminals': Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that if reports are true, BGoko Haram have committed crimes against humanity . Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau (pictured) and his group of insurgents have reportedly been murdering women forced into marriage with fighters, and using children as 'expendable cannon fodder' This comes in response to last week's reports that hundreds of women and children had been seized from Nigerian primary schools by Boko Haram militants to be used as 'human shields'. The Islamic militants took as many as 500 adults and children from primary schools in the north-eastern town of Damasak in late February, Mike Omeri, spokesman for the fight against Boko Haram, confirmed. 'Boko Haram rushed to primary schools they took children and adults that they are using as shields to protect themselves from the menacing advance of troops,' he added. There has also been eye-witness reports of the insurgents slaughtering dozens of Nigerian women who had been forced to marry Boko Haram fighters, before a battle with government troops in the northeast town of Bama. Witnesses said the women's Islamist militant 'husbands' feared they would be killed by advancing troops, and murdered their 'wives' to prevent them from subsequently marrying soldiers or 'infidels'. A member of the Nigerian army covers his nose as human remains are discovered at the former prison of Bama,  used by Boko Haram to hold any opponents, many of who were killed when the militants fled the town . Civilians who fled the fighting in Bama and the surrounding areas in recent days walk at a makeshift camp for displaced people on the outskirts of Maiduguri . Mr Al-Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, also told the council that there are 'persistent and credible reports' of serious rights violations by Nigerian and other security forces responding to Boko Haram. Mr Al-Hussein, son of Prince Ra'ad bin Zeid of Jordan,  called for 'thorough and fully transparent investigations' by authorities. Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, U.N.

"Vladimir Putin is planning to exploit the threat of nuclear war to force Nato out of countries bordering Russia, it has been claimed. A secret meeting between intelligence figures in Moscow and Washington reportedly revealed Putin will consider any attempt to return the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine as declaration of war and will take any necessary step - including using nuclear weapons - to retain control of the region. Notes from the meeting are also said to have revealed that Putin is planning imminent 'destabilising actions' in pro-Western Baltic states in a direct challenge to Nato's promise to defend the countries from Soviet-style Russian expansionism. These disturbances are thought to likely involve cyber attacks or ramping up local ethnic tensions in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania intended to unsettle the region. Threat: Vladimir Putin will consider any attempt to return the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine as declaration of war and will take any necessary step - including using nuclear weapons - to retain control of the region . Notes from the top secret meeting between American and Russian officials in Germany last month have reportedly been seen by The Times. They suggest Russia is prepared to respond with force to the build up of Nato defence forces in the Baltic and by carrying out a wave of cyber attacks that can not be traced back to Moscow. The Kremlin officials - who were briefed by Russian Foreign Minister Segei Lavrov before the meeting and spoke of behalf of Putin - are said to have issued 'a spectrum of responses from nuclear to non-military' in response to the growing Nato army in the region. As well as the situation in the Baltics, two other potential flashpoints were reportedly identified that could lead to nuclear war between Russia and the West: the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, and any future attempt to return the annexed Crimean peninsula to Ukraine. Firepower: Moscow described Nato's supply of weapons to Ukrainian military (pictured) - who hope to defeat pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country - as a 'further encroachment' on the Russian border . In Crimea, Russia is understood to have said that any attempt remove the region from Russian control would be met 'forcefully including through the use of nuclear force'. Meanwhile, Moscow described Nato's supply of weapons to Ukraine in the hope of defeating pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country as a 'further encroachment' on the Russian border. 'The Russian people would demand a forceful response [to such advances]', the Kremlin intelligence chiefs reportedly added. It is the threat posed by Russia to the Baltic states that is thought to be imminent, however, after Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania all raised concerns that Moscow has ambitions in the former Soviet territories, prompting Nato to establish a 'rapid reaction force' in the region. The threat of a Russian invasion of the countries is currently considered so great that Lithuania has gone as far as to reintroduce conscription in order to ensure it is prepared for all out conflict. Ready for conflict: Soldiers take part on in action training near the eastern city of Mariupol in Ukraine . News of the growing tensions emerged as a new men's clothing label launched in Russia in the hope of cashing in on the wave of patriotism currently sweeping the country. The move comes ahead of a giant military parade planned in Red Square on May 9 to mark the 70th anniversary of end of the Second World War underscoring the decisive contribution of the Red Army to defeating Hitler and the Nazis. Unveiled at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Moscow, the brand is called The Army of Russia. The design bureau of the Russian Defence Ministry, headed by Leonid Alexeev, showcased balaclavas, shiny 'military boots', sweat pants and tops emblazoned with the slogans 'Army', 'Polite', and 'Politeness conquests the cities'. 'Polite' is a phrase used by Russians to justify their takeover of Crimea last year. It refers to pro-Moscow forces' apparently 'polite' requests for the dramatically outnumbered Ukrainian security personal to leave the region.","Russian intelligence chiefs took part in secret meeting with U.S. officials .

"A former Kansas elementary school teacher was arrested this week and charged with child sex crimes. Kourtnie A. Sanchez, 25, was arrested Monday on charges including electronic solicitation, unlawful sexual relations, solicitation of unlawful sexual relations and three counts of promoting obscenity to a minor. Sanchez - who is believed to be a mother-of-three - was a student teacher at Marshall Elementary School in Eureka during the fall 2014 semester. Prosecutors allege her victims were aged between 15 and 17, and that the alleged incidents occurred over five months in 2014. However it is unclear how many victims there were.

Obscene: Sanchez was a student teacher at Marshall Elementary School in Eureka during the fall 2014 semester, when the alleged incidents' occurred . Married: Sanchez - whose maiden name is Olsen - is married and is believed to have three children. She will next appear in court on May 8 . Selfie: The former student teacher is seen here in photos from her Facebook account, which has now been deactivated. She left her position in December 2014 . Brief: Sanchez looked sullen during her first court appearance on Tuesday March 31, 2015 .

However she still coached some junior high sports for the school for the past two years. She coached junior high girls' volleyball and basketball, even though she was not a certified teacher, so was not permitted to coach, according to KAKE.com. The school said she left in December following a 'situation', but would not elaborate. Sanchez looked sullen during her first court appearance on Tuesday. The history log of her Snapchat - a cellphone App that allows users to send photos and videos to each other that expire after seven seconds - have been listed as part of the complaint.

"A 115-year-old Detroit-area woman now listed as the world's oldest living person still makes plans for a fishing trip each year and credits God for her longevity. Jeralean Talley of Inkster tops a list maintained by the Los Angeles-based Gerontology Research Group, which tracks the world's longest-living people. Gertrude Weaver, a 116-year-old Arkansas woman who was the oldest documented person for a total of six days, died on Monday. Talley was born May 23, 1899. Scroll down for video .

Talley was born in rural Montrose on May 23, 1899 . Asked for her key to longevity, the Detroit Free Press reports that she echoed previous answers on the topic. 'It's coming from above,' she told the newspaper. 'That's the best advice I can give you. It's not in my hands or your hands.' Michael Kinloch, 56, of Wayne County's Canton Township, is a GM engineer and longtime family friend of Talley's through their church. He said Talley's mental state is 'is very sharp.' R.I.P: Just days after becoming the world's oldest documented person, 116-year-old Gertrude Weaver died Monday. She is seen here on her birthday on July 3, 2014 . Arkansas supercentenarian Gertrude Weaver, born in 1898 to sharecropper parents, died on Monday, after inheriting title from 117-year-old Japanese woman just last week . 'It's unfortunate that other people passed away, but this has certainly elevated her,' Kinloch said. 'She's feeling no pain. She just can't get around like she used to.' Talley's husband died in 1988 and five generations of her family have lived in the Detroit area.

"It had seemed likely to be the moment amateur jockey Lewis Ferguson had dreamt of – a first win on his first ride for new boss, champion trainer Paul Nicholls. But as he approaches the final fence of the John Dufosee Memorial Hunter Chase at Wincanton, clear leader Merrion Square swerves and he loses his balance. As Merrion Square cleanly jumps the fence alongside him, the 18-year-old rider’s waist collides with the fence with such force that he pivots. The birch of the fence acts like a spring board as Ferguson is made to look like a crash-test dummy as his momentum is brought to a juddering halt. 18-year-old amateur jockey Lee Ferguson is flung from his horse in spectacular fashion at Wincanton . The jockey from Hawick is propelled into an almost perfect 360 degree trajectory. His feet point directly to the sky as he continues through a spectacular and heart-stopping rotation that remarkably has all the grace of an Olympic gymnast on his way to maximum points for artistic interpretation. Ferguson’s whip goes flying as he begins to exit his spin and the turf starts to rush towards the disorientated young jockey. There is no time to brace himself for the impact with the on-rushing turf which is about to face him but fortunately at least he has been thrown clear of the chasing horses. Jockey Ferguson hits the fence after his ride stumbles wildly on the approach to the fence . Colliding with the barrier forces the amateur jockey into a spectacular mid-air somersault . Merrion Square was a hotly tipped favourite to win the 4.20 at Wincanton on Wednesday . Impact imminent, no evasion. Ferguson bounces back to earth but remarkably suffers no more than being briefly winded. He is able to stand and walk away with minimum assistance from attendants. A relieved Nicholls later jokes: ‘The only thing damaged is his pride!’ While Ferguson says: ‘I wasn’t aware of what had happened until after I watched the replay in the Weighing Room. I was just a bit winded. I have never had a fall like that before. It is not something you can practise for. Hopefully, it will never happen again. I am on the television but not for the right reasons. Coombe Hill won the race at 4-1 for trainer and former jockey Chris Honour. Ferguson escaped the fall with only 'dented pride' according to trainer Paul Nicholls . Ferguson crashes to the turf but managed to walk away from the freak fall unscathed . Meanwhile, Nicholls expects to have a team of four riders competing at the Grand National on April 11 as he tries to win the event for a second time. The champion trainer's assault on the world's greatest steeplechase will be led Rocky Creek and rising star Unioniste with a supporting cast of Royal Rebellion and Mon Parrain.

"The new 4G mobile phone services in the UK are not as super-fast as the industry promised - and could get worse. The mobile phone companies boasted that 4G services would be ‘five times faster’ than the existing 3G networks when they launched in the autumn of 2012. However, a new official study puts the real figure at an average of 2.5 times faster - 14.7 megabits per second compared to 5.9Mbit/s per second on the 3G service that most people use. A study by Ofcom says 4G speeds in the UK are slower than promised. Mobile phone companies boasted 4G would be five times faster than 3G. But the actual figure is actually only 2.5 times faster - 14.7 megabits per second. Shown is an HTC One XL smartphone at a news conference in Zurich launching 4G in 2012 . At the same time, the evidence suggests that 4G services are likely to slow down as more people connect to them. 4G technology is being promoted by the big mobile networks on the basis it offers high speed internet access and smooth video streaming without annoying buffering. More than 10 million people have been won over by the promises and have signed two year contracts costing an average of £20 ($30) a month. The 4G speed data comes from the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, which supports the technology and insists the figures show a meaningful and significant benefit over the 3G services. Despite this, the figures make clear the step change has not been as remarkable as the major networks - EE, O2, Vodafone and Three - promised. Ofcom’s research compares the speed and geographic coverage of the networks and puts EE, which is the subject of a £12.5 billion ($18.5 billion) takeover by BT, on top. EE’s 4G network, which covers 81 per cent of homes and businesses, delivered the fastest average download speed of 18.6Mbit/s. This looks good when compared with its 3G service, which was a slow 4Mbit/s. Second fastest was Vodafone with 16.4 for 4G versus 6.6 for 3G. O2 came next at 13.9 versus 6.6, followed by Three at a relatively slow 8.5 for 4G which was not very impressive against the 5.4 for 3G. Upload speeds are important when sharing content, such as pictures and videos to social media sites like Instagram and Facebook. EE was also fastest on this measure at 17.6Mbit/s, followed by O2 on 13.2, Vodafone on 13.1 and Three with 9.4. The Three network was the fastest to load a web page at 0.63 seconds, compared to 0.71 for O2, 0.76 for Vodafone and 0.77 for EE. There is good evidence to believe the speeds offered by 4G are slowing down. When 4G services launched at the end of 2012, the average download speed was up at around 19 Mbit/s, however the new research suggests an average of 14.7 and other studies put it as low as 10. This has happened because more people are using the service, effectively causing jams on the airwaves. The only way this can be countered is if the networks spend millions upgrading masts and installing new ones. Ofcom’s research compares the speed and geographic coverage of the networks and puts EE, which is the subject of a £12.5 billion ($18.5 billion) takeover by BT, on top. EE’s 4G network, which covers 81 per cent of homes and businesses, delivered the fastest average download speed of 18.6Mbit/s . The Ofcom figures are based on 120,000 smartphone tests in five sample towns and cities - Edinburgh, Leeds, London, Newcastle and Poole/Bournemouth - between October and December. Its study found that download speeds in Edinburgh fell by 12.5 per cent between the summer and end of last year. The time to call up a web page improved marginally from 0.8 seconds to 0.72. Ofcom admitted: ‘As more people are taking 4G services from the mobile operators, this is likely to affect the average speeds being received.’ The speeds for London were unchanged over the same period, while there was no data for the other areas. Claudio Pollack, Ofcom’s Consumer Director, said the study is designed to boost competition by helping consumers decide which mobile networks are offer the best service. He said: ‘People are increasingly connected, communicating and sharing content on their mobiles when out and about. ‘4G is delivering a significantly enhanced mobile experience and, as these services roll out across the UK, our research will support consumers when choosing the right mobile package for their needs.’","Study by Ofcom says 4G speeds in the UK are slower than promised .

"The victims of a horrific medical experiment run by the United States in Guatemala that deliberately infected individuals with syphilis in order to test drugs and study the disease are now suing Johns Hopkins University. The lawsuit, which has 750 plantiffs and includes victims and their families, is seeking $1billion, claiming that officials from Hopkins approved the study at the time and even helped to plan and monitor it as it ran from 1945 to 1956. The few victims who are still alive were almost all children when they were unknowingly infected, and many among them were orphans. In the aftermath of the experiment, some of the individuals died of syphilis, with open sores covering their bodies, while those who did survive claim they passed the disease down to their children, ending up with babies that were born blind, severely handicapped, and, in at least one case, without a brain. It is estimated approximately 700 people were infected with the disease, and of the roughly 75% who were treated, only 25% were reported to have completed their treatment. Scroll down for video . Marta Orellana (above) was just 9-years-old when one day at the orphanage she was ordered to go to the infirmary and infected with the disease . Federico Mesa (above) was a solider who was forcibly injected with syphilis as a soldier and passed it along to his family . In a $1billion lawsuit, 750 plaintiffs claim Johns Hopkins (above) approved and helped to plan the study, which ran from 1945 to 1956 . Marta Orellana was just 9-years-old when one day at the orphanage she was ordered to go to the infirmary. She was told the lie down and spread her legs, which she resisted at first, but eventually succumbed to the doctors around her. At that point she claims that men with gauze or cotton on their fingers penetrated her, infecting her with syphilis. A few weeks later they called her in to take fluid from her spine, and she says when she turned around to look it was yellow. Even after the study ended she recalls one instance in which she saw one of her doctors and was convinced he was going to kidnap her to continue studying her. In addition to orphans, soldiers, prisoners, mental patients and prostitutes were also sought out for the study. Prostitutes in particular, who would be injected with the disease and then sent to sleep with prisoners. Marta Ruiz's (above) husband was infected, and she gave birth to one child who did not have a brain . Ruiz's other child was born severely handicapped (above) Marta Cesarea Pérez Ruiz did not get infected with the disease during the experiemnt, but her husband did, and it caused major problems with two of their children when he passed it along to her. One was born without a brain, while another was born with syphilis which was left untreated, and is now severely handicapped. Another woman, Victoria, was born blind, which she believes to be a result of her father having been infected with the disease and, again, not having been treated when she was born with syphilis. Federico Mesa, like Orellana, is one of the few original patients still alive. He was a solider at the time he was first infected, and acknowledges that he infected his wife and others with the disease. He was injected with the disease he claims and subjected to numerous tests, and never once told what any of them were for. The United States government only admitted to this experiment in 2010, which was run by Dr. John Cutler (above) Dr. Cutler was also known for his infamous syphilis experiment in Tuskegee, Alabama (above) The United States government only admitted to this experiment in 2010, which was run by Dr. John Cutler, also known for his infamous experiment in Tuskegee, Alabama. In that study, conducted between 1932 and 1972, Dr. Cutler and the US Public Health Service found African-American men in Alabama who had syphilis and claimed they were treating them for the disease, when they were not in fact doing so but rather studying how it progressed. They also unknowingly infected some men with syphilis who did not have the disease. Dr. Cutler defended the experiment even after public outcry had shut it down, saying in 1993: 'It was important that they were supposedly untreated, and it would be undesirable to go ahead and use large amounts of penicillin to treat the disease, because you’d interfere with the study.' He would at one point in his career be appointed assistant Surgeon General of the United States. In the end, the experiment resulted in the death of at least 83 individuals from syphilis. In 1974, a $10million settlement was awarded along with lifetime medical benefits and burial services to all living participants. Those benefits later grew to include all direct family members of victims in 1975. In that study, conducted between 1932 and 1972, Dr. Cutler and the US Public Health Service infected some African-American men in Alabama with syphilis . Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom (right) described the syphilis experiments as 'crimes against humanity' at the time while President Obama and then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apologized (left) A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against the U.S. government by many of the same plaintiffs in the current Hopkins lawsuit back in 2012. That suit listed then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius as defendants, who released a statement at the time saying; 'Although these events occurred more than 64 years ago, we are outraged that such reprehensible research could have occurred under the guise of public health.' They then added; 'We deeply regret that it happened, and we apologize to all the individuals who were affected by such abhorrent research practices.' And while the case was dismissed on a legal technicality, Judge Reggie B. Walton, who rendered the decision, urged the plaintiffs to appeal for the compensation they deserve. The US government cannot be held responsible in a court of law for any action committed in another country. 'For more than half a century since the time of the Guatemala study, scholars, ethicists and clinicians have worked with government officials to establish rigorous ethical standards for human research. Johns Hopkins welcomes bioethical inquiry into the U.S. Government's Guatemala study and its legacy,' Hopkins spokeswoman Kim Hoppe told The Baltimore Sun said in an email. 'This lawsuit, however, is an attempt by plaintiffs' counsel to exploit a historic tragedy for monetary gain.' One of the attorneys for Hopkins meanwhile calls this suit 'baseless.' It was medical historian Susan Reverby from Wellesley College in Massachusetts who first unearthed the shocking details of the tests while researching Dr. Cutler's archives in Pennsylvania. 'I was just completely blown away. I was floored,' she said at the time. 'I expected to find something on Tuskegee. There was nothing. What he left behind were these records from the Guatemala study.' She then said; 'That was all he left behind. Why he did this, I have no idea. Why would you leave this?'","Victims and their families of a US study that infected individuals with syphilis in Guatemala without their knowledge are suing Johns Hopkins .

"The RSPCA is considering abandoning its controversial policy of 'pursuing pointless fox hunting prosecutions' after the collapse of the latest case. The animal charity has no more legal actions left under the Hunting Act after its decision last month to drop the case against William Bryer, joint master of the renowned Cattistock Hunt in Dorset. Following criticism for spending £22.5million pursuing animal welfare prosecutions last year, the RSPCA is now reviewing its policy on fox hunting cases. The RSPCA is considering abandoning its controversial policy of 'pursuing pointless fox hunting prosecutions' after the collapse of the latest case (file picture of the Boxing Day hunt in Lacock, Wiltshire) The RSPCA has the power to bring its own prosecutions rather than rely on the police or the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). However last October, a report commissioned by the charity recommended abandoning the policy and leaving the job to the CPS, which has more expertise. The organisation stressed that its main role is to focus on the rescue, rehabilitation and rehoming of animals, rather than taking people to court. A spokesman said: 'One of the questions we are currently looking into it whether or not we continue to prosecute under the Hunting Act.' Fox hunting was outlawed in 2005 under Tony Blair's government, but groups continue to meet by using trail hunting, usually with a hunt member dragging the scent of a fox across fields and woodlands. Other hunts use an exemption that allows dogs to flush out the animals from woodland which can then be shot. There were more than 400 prosecutions under the controversial Hunting Act between 2009 and 2013. Just 49 people were charged with hunting offences in 2005, but this more than doubled to 110 by 2010. The animal charity has no more legal actions left under the Hunting Act after its decision last month to drop the case against William Bryer, joint master of the renowned Cattistock Hunt (pictured) in Dorset . Fox hunting with dogs was outlawed in 2005 under Tony Blair's government, but groups continue to meet by using trail hunting (file picture) However critics claim many of these people are prosecuted under the Hunting Act for poaching offences, rather than fox hunting, and that hardly any are from official hunts. In 2012, the RSPCA spent £327,000 prosecuting the Heythrop Hunt, in Oxfordshire. David Cameron has ridden with the hunt. Three defendants were accused of interfering with a badger sett while assisting the Cheshire Hunt in February 2012. A year later the RSPCA admitted it did not have enough evidence. Defendants’ costs of up to £10,000 paid by the taxpayer. In April 2013, charity accused two defendants in the Cheshire Forest Hunt of disturbing a badger sett but ten months later offered ‘no evidence’. In November 2013, case against Will Goffe, 33, of the Ledbury Hunt, near Malvern in Worcestershire, was dropped due to insufficient evidence. Last month Mr Bryer's case collapsed after the RSPCA pulled out of a three-year battle to prove he had broken hunting laws. His solicitor, Jamie Foster, claimed that the case had been flawed from the start. He said: 'There is video footage of my client laying legal trails before and after the alleged breach of the hunting ban which was not disclosed to us by the RSPCA.' He said the laying of a trail, or a scent which the hounds can track rather than chasing a live animal, showed that the Cattistock had behaved responsibly, not recklessly as the prosecution claimed. Tim Bonner, from the Countryside Alliance, said: 'We would welcome any decision by the RSPCA to leave the question of prosecuting hunts to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. 'The Society has always faced a fundamental difficulty acting as a prosecutor while also being a political campaigning organisation. It can only be in the best interests of animal welfare that the RSPCA returns to its core principles rather than pursuing pointless prosecutions through the courts.' An RSPCA spokesman said: 'Whilst we have not changed our policy on prosecuting alleged offences under the Hunting Act we don't have any other hunt cases pending at the moment.'","RSPCA considering dropping policy of prosecuting people for fox hunting .

"A drunk Chinese man became so annoyed at his neighbour's dog barking that he killed it by slashing its throat.

Dog murder: Li Chien, 30, had been visiting a nearby pub in Xiulin Township, Hualien county, and became annoyed with a dog owned by neighbour Tang Chao, right, on his way home and killed it . The animal was found several hours later by his distraught owner Tang Chao, 40, who called police. He said: 'I normally wake up early and hear Lucky outside. This time I didn't and immediately knew something was wrong. 'When I got outside I found him lying dead in a pool of blood.' Mr Chao says he suspected his neighbour Li of being the culprit, and called police. He said: 'I don't understand how anyone could want to hurt a dog like Lucky. He was very obedient and hardly ever barked during the day. Sad: Lucky the dog is pictured after having his throat slashed by drunk Li who killed him for barking . Investigation: Taiwanese police search for the weapon in Li's home . 'He only barked when he heard or saw movement during the night, like any good guard dog would do.

"Iran's President Hassan Rouhani (above) has pledged to abide by the commitments of a nuclear agreement that promises to end years of crippling sanctions .

Residents danced in the streets, blared their horns and joyously waved their national flag following the breakthrough deal. The agreement between Iran and the West, struck after a 12-year stand-off, aims to prevent Tehran making a nuclear weapon in exchange for phased sanction relief. Mr Rouhani also called on world powers to fulfil their part of the deal. Speaking after the announcement he said: 'Everything we promised in the nuclear talks ... we will remain loyal to and stand by our promises. 'The world must know that we do not intend to cheat.' David Cameron and Barack Obama insisted the deal was 'strong'. The marathon talks between Iran and the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany in Lausanne, on the shores of Lake Geneva, had run over their deadline by more than two days with many fearing a deal was not possible. But last night, the EU's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini announced Iran had agreed to restrictions on its enrichment of material that can be used either for energy production or in nuclear warheads. Under its terms, Iran would scale down plans to enrich uranium and make weapons-grade plutonium in return for Western powers dropping stringent economic sanctions. They will also be subjected to inspections. If they are found to be in violation of the terms, the sanctions will be put back in place.

Iran and the six world powers must now finalise the deal by June 30. Negotiations on a comprehensive deal will begin in days. After learning that economic and financial sanctions will be rolled back, Iranians danced in the streets, flashing victory signs and brandishing US dollar notes. In Tehran, there were jubilant scenes as locals - many hanging out of cars - celebrated by unfurling national flags and punching their fists in celebration. A new chapter of 'cooperation with the world' will begin when the final deal goes into effect after July, Mr Rouhani said. He said: 'Our enrichment and entire nuclear technology is only for the development of Iran. It will not be against regional countries or against the world. There were joyous scenes in Tehran last night as Iranians waved flags and gave the victory salute . Iranians flash the victory sign from their car while celebrating the breakthrough deal in Switzerland last night . The plans agreed in Switzerland lay the ground for a new relationship between Iran and the six world powers . Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, arriving home, called the agreement a 'win-win outcome' Crucially for Iranians, economic and financial sanctions relating to its nuclear programmes will be rolled back . 'Some think we have no option except to fight the world or to surrender. But there is a third way, too. We have to have cooperation with the world.' Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was mobbed by ecstatic supporters as he arrived at the Mehrabad airport in Tehran after securing the historic deal in Switzerland. He reassured Iranians that the country's nuclear programme will continue but said any negotiation requires give and take. He said: 'Our programme is exclusively peaceful, has always been and always will remain exclusively peaceful. 'Our facilities will continue. We will continue enriching, we will continue research and development.' He added a planned heavy water reactor will be 'modernised' and that the Iranians would keep their deeply buried underground facility at Fordo. 'We have taken a major step but are still some way away from where we want to be', Mr Zarif said, adding that the preliminary step was a 'win-win outcome'. Tuned in: Philip Hammond said the deal would 'provide reassurance that the programme is peaceful' This map helps demonstrate how Iran's nuclear programme is spread across the country - the agreement hopes to prevent Tehran making a nuclear weapon . A Tehran resident, Alireza, 37, told CNN: 'Things can't get worse than they are so, I'm happy with this news. 'This is pretty historic and I pray that my children will be able to live in an Iran that can play nice with the international community.' But the news was not welcomed by all, with Iran's hard-liners describing it as a disaster for Iran. Hossein Shariatmadari, an adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and editor of the hard-line Kayhan daily, said Iran had exchanged its 'ready-to-race horse with a broken bridle'. On a visit to Chorley today, the Prime Minister hailed the 'strong' deal struck in Lausanne. Mr Cameron said: 'I believe this is a great deal and a strong deal. We are all concerned about Iran getting nuclear weapons but what this deal does is block all the pathways to a nuclear weapon, and then have proper inspection and verification. 'Crucially the sanctions that have done so much to bring Iran back to the table, they don't come off unless Iran implements its side.' Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the deal would 'provide reassurance that the programme is peaceful'. Chinese Ambassador to the UN Wu Hailong, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat, an unidentified Russian official, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and US Secretary of State John Kerry, who secured the preliminary agreement in Lausanne . From left Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond speaks to US Secretary of State John Kerry as European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat take their positions before making a statement on the Iranian deal . 'This is well beyond what many of us thought possible even 18 months ago and a good basis for what I believe could be a very good deal,' he said last night. 'But there is still more work to do. The fine detail of any deal will be very important, in particular specifics of oversight measures and mechanisms for handling UN Security Council resolutions. 'Diplomats and technical experts from all sides will work intensively over the coming weeks to finalise the detail by the end of June. Sanctions will remain in place until the comprehensive deal is agreed and implemented.' He added: 'Talks were extremely tough. We always said we would never agree a bad deal. This outcome is testament to the persistence and willingness of all sides to be flexible in finding solutions to seemingly intractable problems. 'It demonstrates what can be achieved when international partners work together in pursuit of a common goal.' Speaking at the White House Rose Garden, Mr Obama said that 'if Iran cheats, the world will know it' Mr Obama staked the reputation of his administration on reaching what many believed was an unlikely deal . Mr Obama urged a more cautious note following the breakthrough. Speaking in the White House Rose Garden yesterday, he said: 'If we can get this done, and Iran follows through on the framework that our negotiators agreed to, we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully. But, he added: 'If Iran cheats, the world will know it.' And 'If there is backsliding' and Iran doesn't meet certain specifications 'there will be no deal.' US Secretary of State John Kerry admitted there was still progress to be made when the deal was signed. He said: 'We have no illusions about the fact that we have a ways to travel. We still have many technical details that have to be addressed.' Following the deal, Israeli leaders immediately raised concerns, vowing to fight any agreement before it is finalized in the coming months. Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the Iran nuclear deal, claiming it threatens the Jewish state and puts his people in mortal danger . One of Netanyahu's scathing comments was shared on his Twitter page during his speech . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been a leading critic of the nuclear talks, stressing he believes it will leave too much of Iran's nuclear infrastructure intact. After speaking to the US President on the phone, he said in a televised statement just hours after the agreement was signed: 'A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel.' He added: 'Such a deal would not block Iran's path to the bomb. It would pave it.' It prompted Netanyahu to urge more pressure to be placed on Iran by Western powers until a better deal is reached. Israel's Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz, who oversees the monitoring of the nuclear programme, claimed the deal was 'disconnected from the sad reality' of the region. He added: 'Since the declaration is far from being a real agreement, we will continue in our efforts to explain and persuade the world in the hope of preventing a bad agreement, or at least to insert corrections and improvements.' The preliminary agreement announced in Switzerland on Thursday is spelled out in a four-page document (below) released by the White House and the State Department. Here's some of what Iran is agreeing to do: . In return, the West will: . Obama insisted that: 'If Iran cheats, the world will know it'.

"A mother who cradled her three-year-old son while she lay down in front of a train killed them both after finding out her husband had a second family in Egypt, an inquest has heard. Depressed Donna Oettinger, 41, had sought urgent psychiatric help in the months before she and her son Zaki died on train tracks in south London in March 2013, Croydon Coroner's Court heard. She had attempted to kill herself three months before the tragedy but was unable to receive the treatment recommended to her by doctors. Depressed Donna Oettinger, 41, had sought urgent psychiatric help in the months before she and her son Zaki died on train tracks in south London in March 2013, Croydon Coroner's Court heard.  Ms Oettinger had starting suffering depression after going to Zaki's father, Mohammed El Shaer, in Egypt, and discovering he had another family, an inquest heard . Her mental health had declined after discovering Zaki's father, an Egyptian national who could not travel to the UK, had a second family. She also was using cocaine regularly for six months and became convinced she had caused lasting damage and her anxiety worsened, the inquest heard. After visiting a psychiatrist in November Zaki was referred to social services, although the case was not reviewed. It meant the family and Zaki's safety was never assessed by the authority. A coroner has today ruled that doctors and social services in charge of looking after Ms Oettinger, made five 'significant' failures in the months before she and her young son lay in the path of a train in March 2012. But at the end of a three day inquest into their deaths, coroner Selena Lynch said that despite the family slipping under social services' radar 'nothing could have be done' to foresee the deaths. A coroner has ruled that doctors and social services in charge of looking after Ms Oettinger, made five 'significant' failures. But at the end of a three day inquest into their deaths, coroner Selena Lynch said that despite the family slipping under social services' radar 'nothing could have be done' to foresee the deaths . Ms Lynch concluded at the end of a three-day inquest that Ms Oettinger, who suffered chronic anxiety, unlawfully killed her son. She said: 'Donna Oettinger suffered from depression and had suicidal ideas. 'She had taken a significant overdose and had been seen by a number of professionals. 'The failures that I have identified, are in some respects quite significant, but can't be said to have caused or contributed to her death or Zaki's.' She said some of the measures now in place might have made a difference, but added: 'I think it is unlikely that Donna Oettinger would have been admitted to hospital or prevented from being alone with her child. 'Whether there might have been some improvement in her condition it is impossible to say.' The Coroner identified five separate failures by doctors and nurses at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and Croydon child protection services, who first came into contact with Ms Oettinger in late 2012. Her mental health had declined after discovering Zaki's father, an Egyptian national who could not travel to the UK, had a second family. She also was using cocaine regularly for six months and became convinced she had caused lasting damage and her anxiety worsened, the inquest heard . Ms Oettinger took an overdose of tablets while visiting a friend in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, on December 13 2012. A social worker in Rotherham advised doctors back in Croydon that she should be cared for by a Home Treatment Team (HTT) However the request was not met. After a follow up appointment back in London a few days later no-one liaised with Rotherham and Ms Oettinger was not reassessed. Doctors decided that instead of treating her at home she would benefit from her own 'care coordinator'. But a miscommunication meant this never happened. As a result the Trust failed to check on Ms Oettinger's condition when she missed a number of appointments in early 2013. The pair died around a month after her last missed appointment. Zaki's grandmother, Carol Oettinger, wept as the the Coroner recorded her daughter's death as suicide and the unlawful killing of Zaki. The coroner said: 'With respect to Donna Oettinger the only appropriate conclusion in this case is a matter of law I conclude to be one of suicide.' With respect to Zaki, she said: 'His mother was suffering from an anxiety disorder. The conclusion for Zaki, again as a matter of law, must be one of unlawful killing.' At the end of the hearing the Coroner pleaded that the horrific nature of Zaki's death and its link to Ms Oettinger's health didn't undo work to end stigma around mental illness. She said: 'It's important to recognise what happened to Donna and Zaki is very much out of the ordinary. '[But] I fear that the stigma of depression and mental illness will grow as a result of events such as these. 'The circumstances of these deaths are extremely upsetting, even for the experienced professionals who dealt with the events of March 22 2013. 'But they represent a tiny fraction of Donna and Zaki's lives. The mother and baby were seen lying on the tracks at a south London station, before their deaths . 'Zaki was a happy child who was very much loved by all those around him and wouldn't have had any time at all to understand what happened to him. 'The events that day do not define them as people. 'Don't let anyone tell you that suicide can always be prevented. They are wrong. Zaki and Donna deserve to be remembered as they were in happier and healthier times.' Speaking after the hearing, Bridget Hughes, Solicitor to the Oettinger family at Kingsley Napley LLP said: 'The Oettinger family is devastated by the loss of Donna and dear Zaki. No one could have fought harder than Donna's mother, Carol, to try and get the care her daughter desperately needed when she became ill. 'The Coroner has heard that there were serious shortcomings in care at the Croydon Mood Anxiety and Personality Disorder Team (MAP) which was managed by the South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. 'These shortcomings permeated through from community psychiatric nurse to consultant level. The service, fragmented in design, was chaotic in its implementation. 'In the family's view, this contributed to Donna's deepening despair and distress. 'Nothing will bring Donna and Zaki Oettinger back, but it is hoped that something may be learned from this family's experiences given the detailed investigation that has since taken place.'","Donna and Zaki Oettinger died on train tracks in south London in 2013 .

"A prolific gang of thieves who carried out early morning raids on multi-million pound mansions to steal cash, jewellery and luxury cars  have been jailed for a total of 17 years. Mohammed Alam, Sayed Juied and Sadek Miah treated burglary 'like a job, a profession,' raiding houses in affluent west London, Herfordshire and Surrey. Over the course of 11 months the gang broke into 21 homes, taking a Ferrari, Porches, Minis, paintings and cash worth £1million, often waiting until home owners were on holiday before striking. Sayed Juied, 32, and Sadek Miah, 31,  were jailed for six years each after admitting to raiding 21 muti-million pound homes in west London, Hertfordshire and Surrey . The gang were undeterred by security systems, officers said, instead viewing them as a sign a property was worth raiding. If they found that valuables were locked in a safe inside, they would simply cut the safe out, before cracking it open later. Officers first began hunting the group in July last year after a raid on a £2.6million house in Somerset Road, Wimbledon, next door to the Lawn Tennis Association. Mohammed Alam, 26, was give five years. Police said the gang treated robbery as 'a profession', surveying properties before they struck . The raiders smashed in a back window before ransacking the property, taking keys to a £30,000 Porsche Cayenne and a £20,000 Mini Cooper, along with £13,000 of jewellery and electrical items. The house was so badly damaged the owners also had to foot a £13,000 repair bill. A week later the gang struck two neighbouring homesin Putney, including one £4.6million house, taking jewellery worth £38,700, and a Porsche Cayenne worth £75,000. Continuing their all-night burglary spree, they hit another Putney home  where they stole a personalised Ferrari worth £280,000, a matching Cayenne worth £130,000, and a painting worth nearly £50,000. Jewellery worth £8,600 was taken along with £1,400 in foreign notes was taken from a house in Kingston Hill during another raid in July. In another burglary in Kingston Hill last July, the back patio doors were forced open while the homeowners were away and the alarm system was smashed. Jewellery worth £8,600 was taken along with £1,400 in foreign currency. Three homes in Arthur Road, Wimbledon, were targeted between December 2013 and July last year, with damage caused to front doors and property worth £500 taken during one raid. Police tracked the trio after staff at the All England Club, home to the Wimbledon tennis championships, caught their car on CCTV. They passed the details to the Metropolitan Police, who found that the car had been rented by Alam, 26, from Unxbridge, who had used his real name. That in turn led them to Juied, 32, and Miah, 31, both from Maida Vale, west London. When police arrested the trio they found multiple Google searches on their computers on how to disable alarm systems and CCTV, and how to crack open safes. The gang took cars, cash, jewellery, electricals and paintings worth a total of £1million over the course of 11 months. Among their haul were two Porche Cayennes (pictured) worth a total of £205,000 . During one raid at a £2.6million opposite the All England Lawn Tennis Association in Wimbledon, the raiders made off with a £20,000 Mini Cooper (pictured) along with a Porsche, cash and jewels . The gang admitted conspiring to commit the burglaries, and were jailed for a total of 17 years at Kingston Crown Court on Wednesday. Alam was given five years behind bars, while Juied and Miah were both given six-year prison terms. Detective Sergeant Dan Mitchell, from Merton burglary team, said: 'They would conduct reconnaissance on big detached houses in really affluent neighbourhoods and then break in. 'They were quite an unusual team, they were not deterred at all by CCTV and alarm systems, that's how they thought somewhere was a worthwhile target. 'They would smash the alarm box as soon as they got in. They would go straight for the safe and try and take the whole safe out, the main thing they wanted was cash. 'They were treating it as a job, a profession. They're the most professional team I have worked on.'","Mohammed Alam, Sayed Juied and Sadek Miah raided a total of 21 homes .

"One Wall Street trader closed out his week a few million dollars richer last Friday - and it was all thanks to social media. The unnamed trader used perfect timing to capitalize on one of the biggest deals of the year when Wall Street Journal mergers and acquisitions reporter Dana Mattioli took to Twitter to announce that Intel was in talks to buy one of its competitors, chipmaker Altera. Seconds later, the trader had snapped up 3,158 contracts of Altera, with each option contract giving them the right to purchase 100 shares. Scroll down for video . An unnamed Wall Street trader made a profit of approximately $2.5million on Friday thanks to a tweet from the Wall Street Journal . The trader purchased 315,800 shares of chipmaker Altera one minute after the Journal reported Intel was in talks to purchase them . CNBC reports that the trader paid $36 a share, and the call option was a mere 35 cents as options on the stock, at that point valued at $34.76 a share, were set to expire in just a few weeks. 3:32pm: The Wall Street Journal reports that Intel is in talks to buy Altera. 3:33pm: Trader purchases 315,800 shares of Altera at $36 a share for a total cost of $11,368,000 plus $110,530 for a $0.35 call option. 3:35pm: Nasdaq suspends trading of Altera in the wake of the Journal's tweet. 4:00pm: Trader sells Altera at the new share price of $44.39 for a total of $14,018,362. This, after factoring in the intital share price and call option, leaves them with a profit of approximately $2,539.832. This call option allowed the trader the right to purchase more shares in the company, in this case 315,800 shares, at the cost of $36, even though the value of shares quickly began to rise. Just 28 minutes later, when the market closed for the day, Altera was valued at $44.39 per share. That was an increase of 28%, but because of the call option, the trader was able to sell their stocks at a far greater profit. So instead of making a 28% profit, the trader made a 2,220% profit of roughly $2.5million when they sold their shares. Even more impressive is that the trader managed to make the purchase just minutes before Nasdaq suspended trading of Altera because of the tweet from Mattioli. What's more, call options for Altera had at that point reached a price of $8.10 by the end of the day. There is also a chance, reports Matt Khouw, that the trader could have been aware of Intel's plan to buy Altera early, or that they used a bot to quickly buy the shares. 'A bot is not as outlandish as it sounds,' Khouw said. 'Traders need to aggregate and filter through tremendous amounts of data quickly and will rely on technology to help if it is available.' As for Intel's reported purchase of Altera, that still has yet to happen. Meanwhile, Intel share prices fell earlier this week in response to the news that they might purchase Altera.","An unnamed Wall Street trader made a profit of approximately $2.5million on Friday thanks to a tweet from the Wall Street Journal .

"The skylines of the world, an African desert and even the barren landscape of the Arctic have been reimagined as part of an annual skyscraper competition. More than 480 design teams submitted entries to eVolo Magazine's 2015 contest and a jury of experts chose three winners and awarded 15 other designs with honorable mentions from 480 global entries. The first place was awarded to a Polish group called Bomp for its 'natural habitat' Essence Skyscraper, beating the designs for a giant 'Times Squared 3015' concept at the heart of Times Square, a Bio-Pyramid in the Sahara and Cybertopia - a project that blurs the lines between digital and physical worlds. The eVolo Magazine Skyscraper Competition was established in 2006 to recognise 'outstanding ideas for vertical living'. The first place in this year's contest was awarded to a team of Polish designers for its project Essence Skyscraper (shown). The main body of the building is divided into 11 natural landscapes including open floor plans, water floors, fish tanks lifted up to 98 feet (30 metres) above ground, and jungle areas . The eVolo awards were established in 2006 to recognise 'outstanding ideas for vertical living'. Since then, the publication has received more than 6,000 projects that use technology, materials, designs and space in novel and challenging ways to question how 'we understand vertical architecture and its relationship with the natural and built environments.' eVolo said the winners were selected for their 'creativity, ingenuity, and understanding of dynamic and adaptive vertical communities.' The first place this year was awarded to Bomp -  a team comprising of designers Ewa Odyjas, Agnieszka Morga, Konrad Basan, and Jakub Pudo - from Poland for the project Essence Skyscraper. The eVolo awards were established in 2006 to recognise 'outstanding ideas for vertical living'. eVolo said the winners were selected for their 'creativity, ingenuity, and understanding of dynamic and adaptive vertical communities.' First place: Essence Skyscraper by Ewa Odyjas, Agnieszka Morga, Konrad Basan, and Jakub Pudo - from Poland. The proposal is an urban mega-structure with a range of natural habitats. Second place: Shanty-Scraper by Suraksha Bhatla and Sharan Sundar from India. The project wanted to provide housing, work and recreational spaces to the inhabitants of Chennai city’s slum in India. Third place: Cybertopia by Egor Orlov from Russia. His design reimagines the city of the future as the combination of digital and physical worlds - a city that grows and morphs instantly according to its residents needs. The proposal is an urban mega-structure with a range of natural habitats. The designers said their design 'would serve as a place to briefly escape urban life and stimulate diverse and complex experiences.' The main body of the building is divided into 11 natural landscapes including open floor plans, water floors, fish tanks lifted up to 98 feet (30 metres) above ground, and jungle areas. Second place went to Suraksha Bhatla and Sharan Sundar from India for their Shanty-Scraper. The project wanted to provide housing, work and recreational spaces to the inhabitants of Chennai city’s slum in India. It was designed to use debris from the city's construction industry including pipes, corrugated metal sheets and timber. The designers explained: 'India’s Slum population is expected to surge to 104 million, or 9 per cent of the national population by 2017. 'As the nation’s disparity between the rich and poor deepens, the number of people living below poverty line has doubled over the last decade. 'Shanty-Scraper aspires to provide a unique solution. The vertical squatter structure  is comprised of post-construction debris [and] the double height semi enclosures serve as utility yards and social gathering spaces.' They said that the 'lifts' are divided into multiple plank platforms made from a simple mechanically-driven lever and pulley. Third place was awarded to Egor Orlov from Russia for his project Cybertopia which reimagines the city of the future as the combination of digital and physical worlds - 'a city that grows and morphs instantly according to its residents needs.' He explained: '""Tomorrow"" we expect a completely different topography of the city. 'It will be a map which includes cyber worlds with intrinsic geography, laws of physics, qualities and even its own residents. It is as though landscapes of computer games have woven into the city space. 'The residential area of the skyscraper represents a constantly growing and developing spatial complex...printed by 3D printer or by drone construction. Second place went to Suraksha Bhatla and Sharan Sundar from India for their Shanty-Scraper (concept drawings shown left and right). The project wanted to provide housing, work and recreational spaces to the inhabitants of Chennai city’s slum in India. It was designed, in particular, to use debris from the city construction industry including pipes, corrugated metal sheets and timber . The Bio-Pyramid: Reversing Desertification design (pictured) was created by David Sepulveda, Wagdy Moussa, Ishaan Kumar, Wesley Townsend, Colin Joyce, Arianna Armelli and Salvador Juarez from the US. They said it is a non-conventional skyscraper that not only operates as a 'bio-sphere' but also as a gateway from Cairo across the Sahara Desert . Meanwhile, the Noah Oasis: Rig to Vertical Bio-Habitat (pictured) was created by Chinese designers Ma Yidong, Zhu Zhonghui, Qin Zhengyu and Jiang Zhe. 'Our design transforms the original rigs into vertical bio-habitats, which aims to exert instant response to oil spills, restore damaged eco-systems and offer shelter from future disasters,' the team said . The 15 honorable mentions include skyscrapers designed for the arctic, structures that intend to reverse desertification, abandoned oil rigs transformed into bio-habitats, and atmosphere laboratories among others. The third place was awarded to Egor Orlov from Russia for 'Cybertopia'. It reimagines the city of the future as the combination of digital and physical worlds - 'a city that grows and morphs instantly according to its residents needs' These include the Bio-Pyramid: Reversing Desertification, created by David Sepulveda, Wagdy Moussa, Ishaan Kumar, Wesley Townsend, Colin Joyce, Arianna Armelli and Salvador Juarez from the US. They said their Bio-Pyramid  is a non-conventional skyscraper that not only operates as a 'bio-sphere' but also as a gateway from Cairo across the Sahara Desert. The Unexpected Aurora in Chernobyl design was submitted by Zhang Zehua, Song Qiang and Liu Yameng from China. This project aims to build a skyscraper for people who return to Chernobyl and is fitted with air and water purification systems. The skyscraper itself is powered by solar energy. 'The skyscraper is just like a Garden of Eden, a new and safe life will start from here,' the designers said. Exploring Arctic: Multifunctional Complex in Dikson Harbour is based on transforming an Arctic hub port. 'It is necessary to create comfortable working and living environment of the Northern Sea Route transport infrastructure,' said designers Nikolay Zaytsev and Elizaveta Lopatina from Russia. 'The initial idea is to design a separate anthropogenic microcosm, detached from the harsh Arctic environment, but based on the dynamic equilibrium between people and nature. Instead of building on the ground, one entry imagined a structure built into the clouds to control the weather. Called Cloud Capture, Taehan Kim, Seoung Ji Lee and Yujin Ha from Korea said their design would catch and redistribute clouds 'where they are affluent to scarce'. This could transform the 'arid-yellow deserts into fresh green spaces'. A similar design was submitted by Shi Yuqing, Hu Yifei, Zhang Juntong, Sheng Zifeng and He Yanan from China called Air Monument: Atmosphere Database. They said the structure would obtain atmosphere samples throughout the year to monitor changes and highlight any concerns. Meanwhile, the Noah Oasis: Rig to Vertical Bio-Habitat was created by Chinese designers Ma Yidong, Zhu Zhonghui, Qin Zhengyu and Jiang Zhe. 'Our design transforms the original rigs into vertical bio-habitats, which aims to exert instant response to oil spills, restore damaged eco-systems and offer shelter from future disasters,' the team said. 'The original rig will become a reactor centre, where the spilled oil will be converted into catalyst and building materials, as well as a recreational centre and research facility.' Underwater, the structure will be secured to pipes. And in the US, a group of designers proposed a self-contained city featuring a stadium, forest, farm and beach on the top of a mile-high skyscraper in New York City.

It was designed by Blake Freitas, Grace Chen and Alexi Kararavokris. The group said that as the planet continues to overpopulate, their entry explores spatial, environmental and experimental possibilities of vertical living. The proposed community would usher in a 'new kind of daily life', where farmers tended to crops which provided oxygen and food, visitors attend a football game by catching an elevator to the third floor and residents walk through a redwood forest thousands of feet above the city.

"Victim: Dr Martin Luther King . The FBI repeatedly deceived Congress by destroying vital files relating to the assassination of Martin Luther King, a new book claims. Leading King historian Stuart Wexler said that the bureau chose to cover up the potential role of a high level informant in the killing rather than tell the truth. Wexler said that it could have been one of the greatest scandals in the history of the FBI - but now we may never know what happened. By destroying the files the FBI disobeyed a direct order not to do so from a Congressional Committee which had been set up to investigate the killing of King and former President John F Kennedy. Wexler told Daily Mail Online that the bureau's actions were 'disturbing' and that his research had left him suspecting that agents had mounted a deliberate operation to bury the truth forever. King was shot dead by James Earl Ray on 4 April 1968 at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee in a killing which galvanized the civil rights movement. Power: Dr King's leadership of the civil rights movement was demonstrated in the I Have A Dream speech in 1963. His death on 4 April 1968 shocked a nation already scarred by the deaths of President John F Kennedy - and the civil leader's murder was followed by that of Robert Kennedy . Guard: The balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, where Dr King was shot. Caught: James Earl Ray, the assassin of Dr. Martin Luther King Jnr. being taken to his cell by Sheriff William Morris,  in Memphis Tennessee, July 19, 1968. He had been on the run since the death . Key figures: James Earl Ray (left) in the wanted picture issued by the FBI. Joseph Milteer (right) was a racist  known for a covertly recorded interview in 1963 in which he spoke of the Kennedy and King assassinations before they happened . Interest in King's life has been renewed since the release of the Oscar-winning film 'Selma', about the historic march from the Alabama town, which was 50 years ago this year. But Wexler said that there are still many unanswered questions about his death which he addresses in a new e-book called 'Killing King'. The FBI plot began when the House Committee on Assassinations was set up in 1976 - it would finish its inquiries into the killing of King and Kennedy in 1978. Wexler said that the FBI appears to have been spooked after an investigative reporter called Dan Christensen published a number of articles about the Miami connection to both assassinations, articles which the committee were interested in. Wexler said that, according to his research, in 1977 the MURKIN (murder of King) files were destroyed from the FBI field offices in Miami and Mobile, Alabama. Crucially, both had information on Tommy Tarrants, a former high ranking Klan member from Mississippi. Wexler said that something in that file made the FBI upgrade Tarrants from a little-known racist activist to major player in the King assassination to the point where they showed his picture to witnesses at major crime scenes. What that something was, it now seems we will never know. Also destroyed from the Miami field office was the the file on Joseph Milteer, a well-known racist who is known for a covertly recorded interview he gave in 1963 in which he talks about the Kennedy assassination and the King assassination before they happened. Wexler said: 'It's entirely possible that Milteer was raising the bounty money for King's assassination.' The destruction of the files broke a key rule of the FBI's record keeping; that it doesn't get rid of information on people who are still alive. Tarrants was alive then - and he still is today. According to Wexler, every other field office investigation of the King murder was preserved, just as Congress ordered, and eventually transferred to the national Archives and Records Administration. Wexler said: 'I have no doubt this was done deliberately. They are not destroying everybody's files, they are selectively destroying files. 'They wanted Tarrants to give evidence to the committee, they didn't want him to be a suspect. KKK: Tommy Tarrants was a figure in the KKK and seemed initially marginal to the investigation into the MLK murder but was suddenly made a significant figure. Was it because of his links to another more senior figure that files were destroyed? In charge: J Edgar Hoover, the FBI chief, had condemned Dr King and had a mantra that protecting the bureau's reputation was all that mattered. Wexler says his successor stuck to that belief . Dramatic hearing:  James Earl Ray testifies in 1978 before the House Assassinations Committee. At left is Ray's attorney Mark Lane. Ray told the panel he did not kill Martin Luther King, Jr. 'By that point Tarrants had already made a conversion away from radical racist Christianity - he is now a preacher. 'Until then he had been in prison for a bombing and he'd made a full conversion. The FBI arranged for him to get out of prison, which was unheard of.' Wexler said that another reason why Tarrants was problematic is that he led directly to the Klan in Mississippi, which was one of the most violent anti-black chapters of the group at the time. He said: 'Laude Matthews. also known as L.E. Matthews, was due to take over as head of the Klan there and Matthews was a big time deep cover agent for the FBI. 'We can imagine a situation where the FBI does not want the Congressional investigation to lead back to Laude Matthews. 'They did not want to expose him to suspicion. Imagine what it would have looked like if an FBI informant had a connection to the King assassination? 'This is speculation of course, but it would have been was on the worst scandals in the history of the FBI'. If the FBI had covered its tracks over King's assassination, it would fit into the pattern of duplicity and double dealing that marked the bureau's handling of King. The FBI had put him under intense surveillance and bugged his hotel rooms and attempted to destroy his marriage by sending his wife recordings of him with other women. At a press conference in 1964 then FBI director Herbert Hoover went so far as to call King the 'most notorious liar in the country'. Portrayal: David Oyelowo in his acclaimed performance as Dr King in this year's movie Selma . Never forgotten: The memorial at the site of Dr King's assassination.  The anniversary is tomorrow. A few days later one of his deputies, William Sullivan, wrote a vicious letter to King and gave it to an agent in Miami to post to him in Atlanta. It became known as the 'suicide letter' and called him 'filthy' and 'abnormal' and urged him to take his own life. The letter read: 'In view of your low grade, abnormal personal behavior I will not dignify your name with either a Mr. or a Reverend or a Dr. 'And, your last name calls to mind only the type of King such as King Henry the VIII and his countless acts of adultery and immoral conduct lower than that of a beast.' The head of the FBI between 1973 and 1978 was Clarence Kelly, a staunch ally of Hoover. Wexler described Kelly as a man who followed Hoover's mantra that the reputation of the bureau was the most important thing, 'no matter what'. Wexler said that the FBI could still go some way to salvaging its reputation; one way of doing so would be to give King's case to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Cold Case team, which has looked as more than one hundred civil rights crimes, mostly from the 1960s. He also implored the FBI to run the fingerprints it has from the various crime scenes such as rooming house and car used by Ray. The last time it did so was in 2000 when the integrated Automated Fingerprint identification System was in its infancy and could not even recognize palm prints. It also only covered one state and had a tiny database. Wexler said: 'Now the database is three times larger and covers 50 states. They could run the tests in a day. If they want copies of the prints I have them all, digitized.'","FBI accused in new book - by leading King historian Stuart Wexler - of misleading Congress by destroying files on civil rights leader's murder .

"Manning's profile picture is a sketch done of her since she began living as a woman . Chelsea Manning, the US Army solider who was convicted of leaking thousands of secret diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks, has begun tweeting from behind bars at Leavenworth military prison in Kansas. Manning sent out 15 tweets on Friday afternoon - mostly to thank her supporters, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and journalist Glenn Greenwald. Within just a few hours @xychelsea racked up more than 16,000 followers. She also gave a shout out to Tom Morello, the frontman of Rage Against the Machine. 'Thank you for the support! I’m a huge fan of RATM and your music,' she tweeted. Morello replied: 'Take care, stay strong.' Manning's lawyer told Politico that she was dictating the tweets over the phone to supporters in 'close contact' with her. She mentioned the difficulty of tweeting from prison in a tweet that said: 'Tweeting from prison reqs a lot of effort and using a voice phone to dictate #90sproblems.'

"Deborah Fuller has been banned from keeping animals after she dragged her dog behind her car, causing wounds as she drove at 30mph . A dog breeder and exhibitor who dragged her pet behind her car at a speed of 30mph and failed to get painful wounds to its paws and chest treated, has been banned from keeping animals and had her dogs confiscated. Deborah Fuller, 56, dragged her dog Tango for 400 metres behind her car as she drove along the B1066 near Long Melford, Essex. The Rhodesian ridgeback was left with injuries to all four paws as well as grazing to his chest and a deep wound on his elbow. He is believed to have somehow escaped from the boot of her car and was dragged along the single carriageway because his lead was attached to the vehicle's tailgate. Fuller, of Lawford, Essex, denied causing unnecessary suffering to an animal by not taking it to the vets and failing to take steps to safely secure a dog within a vehicle, but was convicted following a hearing at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court. Fuller has also been banned from keeping animals for five years and had her 27 other dogs confiscated. Chairman of the bench Anthony Ealden said if Tango had been taken to the vet earlier 'unnecessary suffering' could have been avoided. He said: 'We believe for whatever reason, known only to yourself, you had no intention of getting veterinary treatment as a matter of urgency. 'We do not accept your reason for delaying treatment as reasonable.' The incident took place on June 11, 2014, when the dog was seen being dragged along the B1006 behind the car. Tree surgeons working nearby spotted what had happened and tried to get Fuller, who is a Rhodesian Ridgeback breeder and exhibitor, to stop her car. She didn't stop until she reached the end of the carriageway and they took her registration number and reported her to police who called the RSPCA, the court heard. Tango was later found by inspectors  in an outbuilding at Fuller's home with bandages on his paws. He was taken to a vet and given treatment for his injuries, which took eight weeks. Tango was left with considerable injuries to his paws and stomach, as well as a deep elbow wound . Tango, a Rhodesian ridgeback, pictured before being injured by being dragged along the road . Fuller claimed she had not been aware the rear hatch of her car had opened and claimed she had given the one-year-old dog first aid, and had already arranged for him to go to the vet when police turned up. Mike Fullerton, defending Fuller, said:  'When Deborah Fuller was being restrained she asked why she was not allowed to take the dog to the vet.' RSPCA inspector Sam Garvey said after the sentencing: 'Eyewitnesses report they saw the dog being dragged about 400 metres at a speed of 30mph. 'This must have been horrific for poor Tango. So painful, and so distressing. 'It is hard to say what caused Tango to be dragged behind a moving car in this way, but by the time we found him, seven hours later, he was urgently in need of vet treatment. The animal was taken to the vets and treated for the burns, suffered when he was dragged along the road . Judges ruled that the dog's suffering could have been avoided if Fuller had taken him to the vets earlier . 'He had injuries to the pads of all four feet, causing the black layer of skin to be removed. He also had grazing to his chest area and a nasty deep wound to his elbow and leg area. 'It took a period of eight weeks to heal the wounds and for his skin to grow back over his pads so he could walk without discomfort.' Fuller was also ordered to pay £3,000 costs, given a 12 month community order and a two month curfew from 7pm to 7am. Tango was taken to a vet for treatment after being found and has made a full recovery in foster care. The court also allowed confiscation of all the animals owned by Fuller, which are currently in RSPCA care. Tango was removed from Fuller, along with more than 40 other dogs that were at her Essex home . Fuller and her partner Phil Sheldrake, 59, previously pleaded guilty to 16 charges of causing unnecessary suffering and failing to meet the dogs' needs at Colchester Magistrates Court in June. Earlier this month the case was thrown out after the High Court ruled that inspectors did have the correct warrant to seize 44 dogs from their Essex home. Tendring District Council had been granted a warrant to investigate 'nuisance' at the house, following complaints about noise and dog faeces. The council joined forces with the RSPCA and seized 44 dogs from the house, with the animal welfare charity claiming several of the animals were emaciated. However the trial was halted when district judge Kenneth Sheraton said evidence gathered by inspectors was inadmissible because they did not have the correct warrant.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT - Deborah Fuller dragged her one-year-old dog behind her car for 400 metres at a speed of around 30mph .

"A writer has revealed why she stopped washing her hair six years ago after embarking on a quest to try and control her greasy, limp locks - by avoiding shampoo. New Yorker Sarah Theeboom was inspired to give up using products on her hair after she ran into an old friend whose once dry, frizzy locks were smooth and shiny. When Sarah asked for her secret, her friend explained that she had simply stopped shampooing, opting to partake in the apparently-popular 'no poo' movement, which Sarah had never heard of until that moment. 'I wasn’t in love with it, and I just didn’t really know what to do,' she told Seventeen. 'I wanted to try my friend’s trick and stop shampooing.' Scroll down for video . Natural beauty: Sarah Theeboom (pictured) hasn't washed her hair in six years after a friend told her that giving up shampoo was the secret to gorgeous locks . Although her friend warned her that her scalp and hair would go through a nasty adjustment period, Sarah wasn't prepared for the dandruff and excessive amounts of grease that she first experienced after she first started shunning shampoo during a three-week vacation to Thailand. Sarah recalled that during those first few weeks her hair was the 'greasiest' it had ever been. 'I was so embarrassed that I didn’t want to show my head to anyone,' she explained. Despite the fact that she 'almost cracked' and went back to shampoo, she forged on with her mission. After vacation she started wrapping her hair with headbands every day. When she showered she would wet her hair and scrub her scalp with her fingers. And even though her boyfriend was critical of the idea, Sarah explained that, by this point, she 'felt committed' to her cause. New woman: The writer from New York City said her hair is now silkier and 'totally frizz-free' since she gave up using shampoo . It took six weeks for her hair to feel somewhat normal again and then another six weeks of her hair looking 'so-so' before the 'magic happened'. 'I started to see what my natural hair was like when I wasn’t constantly doing stuff to manipulate it,' Sarah explained. 'It was silky and wavier and totally frizz-free.' The 'no poo' movement has gained popularity over recent years because of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Shailene Woodley, Adele and Jessica Simpson who have revealed that that they avoid washing their hair for days - and sometimes months - on end. Because it is no longer considered a ludicrous concept, Sarah said that she typically doesn't have a problem sharing her hair secret, but she did note that sometimes she will come across someone who just doesn't get it - including one hair stylist who didn't understand why she couldn't shampoo her hair. Sarah explained that her although her current regimen sounds like a 'beauty philosophy', she was really just experimenting to see what worked for her. 'I don’t think shampoo is evil or bad for your hair...' she said. 'I still have good hair days and bad hair days, but overall, my hair looks and feels so much healthier.'","Sarah Theeboom, from New York City, gave up using hair products as a part of the 'no poo' movement .

"US tourists will have plenty of options for accommodation when they invade Cuba, with Airbnb now allowing American travellers to book rooms on the Caribbean island for the first time. More than 1,000 Cuban properties are listed on the popular home-rental website – private rooms are available for as little as $12 (£8) a night – and the bulk of them are located in the capital of Havana. Airbnb has plans for rapid growth in Cuba, where its employees have spent the last three months signing up property owners in advance of the expected crush of American visitors. More than 1,000 Cuban properties are listed on Airbnb, with 40 per cent located in the capital of Havana . Kay Kuehne, regional director for Airbnb, told the Associated Press: ‘We believe that Cuba could become one of Airbnb's biggest markets in Latin America. ‘We are actually plugging into an existing culture of micro-enterprise in Cuba. The hosts in Cuba have been doing for decades what we just started doing seven years ago.’ Forty per cent of Airbnb’s listings in Cuba are in Havana, while the rest are mostly located in tourist hotspots along the coast. With more than one million private listings, Airbnb’s ambitious plans for Cuba are being hailed by AP has the most significant US business expansion on the island since the old Cold War foes pledged to restore full diplomatic relations and move towards opening trade. One of the biggest hurdles Airbnb hosts are currently facing is the lack of internet access across the island . Property owners are welcoming the opportunity to make some extra cash in a country with a sluggish state-run economy, and they hope it will help to spur a revival on the island as they compete with hotels for business. Israel Rivero, who owns pre-war flat in central Havana and will charge $30 (£20) a night on Airbnb, told AP: ‘I think this is going to help our business prosper, to definitely improve, not just private business, but everything here.’ Collin Laverty, owner of tour operator Cuba Educational Travel, said property owners have already been investing central air conditioning, improved water pressure and other amenities in order to be able to charge more than $25 (£16) a night for basic service. He said: ‘You're starting to see places that can compete with three- and four-star hotels.’ Tourists leave a privately-owned home with rooms for rent in Havana . For the time being non-US travellers will not be able to book rooms or flats in Cuba through Airbnb . One of the biggest hurdles Airbnb hosts are currently facing is the lack of internet access across the island, which restricts their ability to check on bookings and respond to questions from potential guests. They also face challenges when it comes to accepting credit card payments, as they are unable to access much of the international banking system due to US sanctions that haven’t been lifted. Mr Kuehne said Cuban and US authorities have welcomed Airbnb’s expansion. But for the time being non-US travellers will not be able to book rooms or flats in Cuba through the website. With many hotels filled with non-US visitors, one of the biggest concerns about the return of American tourists in Cuba is a shortage of suitable accommodation. While diplomatic talks continue, Americans still can’t freely travel to the Caribbean nation. Because of restrictions under the US embargo they must meet one of 12 US government-approved categories for legal travel, including professional research and religious activities.","More than 1,000 properties are listed in Cuba on the home-rental website .

"Online marriage proposals and star-struck children are a regular feature of Rae Johnston's life. But the 33-year-old Sydney based tech and gaming journalist, who is known for dressing up as Wonder Woman in her spare time - as well as her sideline zombie and Huntress costumes - insists she's a geek through and through. Ms Johnston is one of the growing number of Australians who are dressing up in hand-made costumes of their favourite comic book, television show or movie characters in the name of cosplay - a trend that has exploded online and at conventions across the globe. Rae Johnston said she receives regular online proposals for her signature cosplay Wonder Woman outfit . The 33-year-old Sydney based tech and gaming journalist has been selected to host the Cosplay championships at this year's Oz Comic-Con - the official Australian version of the internationally renowned pop culture convention, the San Diego Comic-Con . 'I specialise in Wonder Woman. She's my signature character and eventually, I'm working my way through all of her costumes. But I also love group Cosplay which is when a bunch of us get together and have a theme like the walking dead and we'll go to a convention and just walk around the floor being those characters,' Ms Johsnton told Daily Mail Australia. 'I got into cosplay about three years ago, which is not long considering I've been going to conventions since I was little, but I had no crafting skills. Then I discovered there are all these tutorials online and on social media - all these ways of accessing information on how to make costumes and I thought: if I'm going to learn to sew, then I'm going to learn to sew Wonder Woman.' Countless hours and hundreds of dollars have gone into some of her costumes, but Ms Johnstone said many cosplay costume makers prided themselves on spending under $10 on a single costume - ripping apart old ones and including things they had around the house - while others fork our thousands of dollars for the perfect materials. Ms Johnston says she chose Wonder Woman as her signature - with each costume taking up to six weeks to make - because of her empowering character and 'compassion'. 'She always leans towards non-violence first and is very diplomatic - for example one of her weapons is her lasso of truth. She's a fantastic role model for younger girls and I do a lot of charity events dressed as her, like hospital visits for disabled and underprivileged children where we just rock up and brighten up their day. It took her six weeks to create her Wonder Woman outift, but she says she plans to work her way through all of the super hero's costumes . Ms Johnston said that what was once considered traditionally 'geeky' has become quite mainstream, with more and more Australians connecting to cosplay stars online . 'But I also love group Cosplay which is when a bunch of us get together and have a theme like the walking dead and we'll go to a convention and just walk around the floor being those characters,' Ms Johsnton, dressed as DC COmic's Huntress, added . 'But one of my all-time favourite experiences was at Supernova convention when I had a little girl come up to me and she was shaking because she thought I was the real life Wonder Woman and it was just incredible - that meant the world to her.' With a combined social media following of 25,000 fans, Ms Johnston is lined up to host the Cosplay championships at this year's Oz Comic Con - the official Australian version of the internationally renowned pop culture convention, the San Diego Comic-Con, which saw over 130,000 guests attend in 2014. Meanwhile both Perth and Adelaide are expecting over 20,000 people to attend their separate events this year. Ms Johnston said that what was once considered traditionally 'geeky' has become quite mainstream, with more and more Australians connecting to cosplay stars online and learning the craft of costume making through podcasts and tutorials on social media.

The journalist (pictured dressed as DC Comic's Black Canary) visits children's hospitals dressed as Wonder Woman to 'brighten their day' 'Some people do it because they love getting into character and walking around a convention floor. For some it's about the crafting of the costume. For others, it's about being part of the community,' Ms Johnston said. 'It's a huge ice breaker for making friends. The thing about the geek community is we have a lot of introverts - we don't have a lot of people who would walk around introducing themselves, but if your dressed as the doctor [from Doctor Who] and so is someone from across the room - they might walk up to you and ask how you made elements of your costume.  I've met some of my best friends at various conventions because we share the same passion and fandoms. 'People can make a career out of it too. Some cosplayers have started working as consultants for video game companies who want to design their character's costumes so that they are easily replicated in real life because they've recognised cosplay as a massive marketing strategy. It means that it's more likely to be made by someone and seen on a convention floor and that's a huge draw card for people to start talking about that particular game.' Famous Californian cosplayer Abby Dark Star (pictured as DC Comic's Poison Ivy) has almost 500,000 fans online and is one of the judges at the Cosplay championships at this year's Oz Comic Con . Abby keeps her real name private due to her career in social media and marketing . There are charitable benefits to getting involved too. Ms Johnston is one of many members of Medic, a group which raises awareness of 'a different geeky cause' each month, such as tech groups who create controllers for people with disabilities. Famous Californian cosplayer Abby Dark Star, who has almost 500,000 fans online and will judge the Cosplay championships at this year's Oz Comic Con, likened cosplay to football fans who choose to dress up at matches. 'Imagine you have a girl and she may struggle with her image, but she plays the video game World of War Craft and sees a strong female overturning obstacles, very smart and capable and she says 'I get inspired by this character' and she want to dress up as her to emulate the characteristics,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'That's the way they show their passion - by dressing up.' Abby, who keeps her real name private due to her career in social media and marketing, has created at least 30 finished costumes over the last 10 years, some of which took her up to four months to finish. 'In my head I'm just a 12 year old still getting teased by the boys for my nerdy star trek books,' the cosplay fan, who teaches others her craft through panels and tutorials, said. 'I'm a cosplay community manager - it's about the community for me, seeing people grow and be empowered and accepted, especially when it comes to women. 'If you show any skin your immediately labelled a w**** and to me, I see all these women characters who have super strength and brains - like brilliant doctors and other amazing things - and if you would call them a w**** they would kick your butt - I dig that.' Abby has created over 30 finished costumes over the last 10 years, some of which took four months to finish.

"This video captures the stomach-churning moment a physics teacher swings an axe into his co-worker's genitals - in a disastrously misjudged class experiment. The nauseating footage was captured on a camera phone at a school in Portland, Oregon, and shows the well-built man lecturing a crowd of students before excitedly asking 'everybody ready?'. The teacher then orders the class to give him a count as he hoists the axe up over his head and swings it directly into the unlucky fellow-teacher's crotch - causing him to squirm violently on the floor. Facing the axe: The well-built teacher tells his class about the effect the axe will have on the cinder block before hoisting the implement into the air and swinging it straight on to the helpless teenager's groin . Ouch! This is the teacher's face the moment after he was stuck in the crotch by the blunt end of the axe. Amazingly, his co-worker stepped up and immediately took a second swing . Unmasked: The teacher, seen here after the second axe blow shattered the cinder block, seems to be hurting from the bed of nails he was holding to his chest - rather than to hit to his groin . The idea of the experiment appears to be to crack open a cinder block that is balancing on the chest of one of his co-workers using the blunt end of the axe. Standing with his legs astride over the teacher, he swings the tool over his head but completely misses his target. The man appears to be wearing face protection but has not thought to cover his groin area and is seen writhing on impact just before the 17-second clip cuts out. Uploaded to YouTube, the video has been titled: 'How the physics teacher lost his job.' No pain, no gain: As his class of pupils watch in anticipation, the teacher misses his target and brings the blunt end of the axe directly down on to the teacher's genitals before the clip cuts out . Another hit: The teacher with the axe immediately took a second swing and crushed the cinder block . However, teenager Haneef Mubarak says nobody was fired - and remarkably the teacher who was hit turned out OK. Mubarak, who says he is a student in the class, posted a second video and revealed that the unfortunate man holding the cinder block was actually the teacher of the AP Physics class at a high school in Portland. The new clip shows the teacher with the axe actually take a second swing at the block, even as his coworker writhes in pain on the floor. The teacher is actually holding the cinder block on his check on top of a bed of nails. The experiment was meant to show that the nails would not pierce the teacher because the force was evenly distributed, Mubarak wrote on Reddit. The new video shows the teacher get up and dust himself off. He appeared to have more pain in his chest, where he took the second hit, than his in groin. 'He got up and resumed teaching after the demo was over. Looked uncomfortable, but ya gotta do what ya gotta do,' Mubarak said.","Nauseating footage captured on phone and uploaded to YouTube in the US .

"A British man has been arrested in Turkey after an operation against a far-left militant group that left a prosecutor dead. The British national, of Polish origin but who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday as part of an operation against the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, according to reports. Members of the banned leftist group - known as the DHKP-C - took senior Turkish prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz hostage last week. Both the prosecutor and the hostage takers were killed after a police shoot-out. Scroll down for video . Sick: Members of the banned leftist group - known as the DHKP-C - took senior Turkish prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz hostage last week. Both the prosecutor and the hostage takers were killed after a police shoot-out . Murderers: A handout photo provided by the Istanbul head prosecutor shows two hostage takers seconds after they entered the Istanbul Court House where Mehmet Selim Kiraz was later killed . A Foreign Office spokeswoman said this morning: 'I can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Turkey and that we are offering consular assistance.' The DHKP-C is listed as a terrorist organisation by the US, EU and Turkey. Two members of the DHKP-C and the prosecutor they held hostage inside a courthouse in Istanbul died after the shootout. Police had negotiated with the gunmen for six hours before the violent end to the hostage situation, according to Istanbul police chief Selami Altinok. Pictures emerged of the hostage takers holding a gun to the prosecutor's head during the siege. Sadness: Thousands of people attended last Wednesday's funeral ceremony for Turkish prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz inside the main courthouse where he died the previous day . Grief:  Mehmet Selim Kiraz was shot in the head during the stand-off and rushed to hospital where doctors tried in vain to save his life. Pictured is his funeral the following day . Police had negotiated with the gunmen for six hours before the violent end to the hostage situation. Pictured are the thousands of people who turned out for Mehmet Selim Kiraz's funeral . Turkey has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of Kiraz held during the armed siege last week. Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. The prosecutor, identified by state television as Kiraz, was shot in the head during the stand-off and rushed to hospital where doctors tried to save his life. Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu and hospital officials later announced he had died. Private news agency Dogan reported police special forces had entered the building, which was evacuated. It was not clear how the assailants managed to get arms into the courthouse. Mr Kiraz was the prosecutor investigating the death of a teenager who was hit by a police gas canister fired during nationwide anti-government protests in 2013. The DHKP-C, which seeks a socialist state, has carried out sporadic attacks, including a suicide bombing on the US Embassy in 2013 that killed a security guard. The group was more active in the 1970s. Another attack: Just one day after the death of Kiraz, a woman armed with guns and hand grenades was shot dead as she tried to attack Istanbul's police headquarters . Police HQ: Television footage showed police sealing off the street in the central Aksaray neighbourhood . Armed: The woman was carrying a rifle, two hand grenades and a pistol. Local media said a man was also held . Just one day after the death of Kiraz, a woman armed with guns and hand grenades was shot dead as she tried to attack Istanbul's police headquarters. A picture of the red-haired woman lying on the ground with a rifle strapped to her body and a handgun by her side has emerged and television footage showed police sealing off the street in the central Aksaray neighbourhood. 'The Istanbul police headquarters on Vatan street was targeted by rifle fire and a female terrorist was killed in the clash,' the Istanbul governor's office said in a statement at the time. The woman was carrying a rifle, two hand grenades and one pistol, it said. Local media said a man had also been detained. On the same day police separately detained a gunman who entered an Istanbul branch of the ruling AK Party and hung from its window a Turkish flag with the emblem of a sword added. It was not immediately clear whether any of the attacks were linked, but Prime Minister Davutoglu warned of the risk of 'provocations' and attempts to cause chaos ahead of June's national election.","Man is a British national of Polish origin, but has not yet been identified .

"Blue Bell Ice Cream announced Friday that it has suspended operations at an Oklahoma production facility that officials had previously connected to a foodborne illness linked to the deaths of three people. 'We are taking this step out of an abundance of caution to ensure that we are doing everything possible to provide our consumers with safe products and to preserve the trust we have built with them and their families for more than a century,' the company said in a statement. Last month, the company and health officials said a 3-ounce cup of ice cream contaminated with listeriosis was traced to a plant in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Scroll down for video . Blue Bell Ice Cream has suspended operations at an Oklahoma production facility that officials had previously connected to a foodborne illness linked to the deaths of three people . Ten products recalled earlier in March were from a production line at a plant the company's headquarters in Brenham, Texas . The now-recalled ice cream product - cups of chocolate, strawberry and vanilla - is not sold in retail locations and is shipped in bulk to 'institutional accounts' such as hospitals in 23 states that comprise less than 5 per cent of the company's sales. 'We recommend that consumers do not eat any Blue Bell brand products made at the company's Oklahoma facility and that retailers and institutions do not sell or serve them,' the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said late Friday. Ten products recalled earlier in March were from a production line at a plant in Brenham, Texas, the company's headquarters. The recall, the first in the company's 108-year history, began when five patients at Via Christi St. Francis hospital in Wichita, Kansas, became ill with listeriosis while hospitalized at some point from December 2013 to January 2015. Officials determined at least four drank milkshakes that contained Blue Bell ice cream. Three of the patients later died. Listeriosis, also known as listeria, is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes, according to the CDC. Listeriosis, also known as listeria, is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes . The disease primarily affects pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. The CDC also said Friday that it has identified six patients with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 that was indistinguishable from that found in the 3-ounce cup ice cream product traced to the Oklahoma plant. Four of the six patients were hospitalized in Texas for unrelated problems before developing listeriosis, according to the CDC. The one patient for whom information is available reported eating ice cream in a Texas hospital before developing listeriosis and the Texas Department of State Health Services reported the hospital had received Blue Bell brand ice cream cups, the CDC said. The 'investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing,' the CDC said. Blue Bell said it will conduct a 'careful and complete examination' of its Oklahoma plant 'to determine the exact cause of the contamination.' The company says it voluntarily shut down the plant, then notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . 'Once our investigation is complete and we have made all necessary improvements, it will return to operation,' according to the company's statement. 'Our other plants continue to operate and supply our products to retail stores and institutional customers.' The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been notified of the company's decision to voluntarily shut down the plant, Blue Bell said. In addition to the Broken Arrow plant, the company has two plants in Brenham and one in Sylacauga, Alabama. The recalled ice cream had been shipped to Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming.","Last month, the company and health officials said a 3-ounce cup of ice cream contaminated with listeriosis was traced to a plant Oklahoma .

"Salvina Formosa does weights and sit-to-stand exercises every week to improve her fitness . She may be too old for a lot of things but working out is not one of them. Salvina Formosa from South Wentworthville, west of Sydney, has been taking part in step classes to improve her fitness and strength to walk after tripping over on an uneven footpath. The 101-year-old widow, who was never keen on exercise in her youth, now does weights and sit-to-stand exercises several times a week at Southern Cross Care in Merrylands . And there's no sign of her slowing down at any time soon. 'I can now do 20 sit-to-stand exercises,' she said. 'I feel a lot more confident getting up out of a chair, walking on uneven ground and walking to the letterbox.' The Western Sydney Local Health District's  community-based program  Stepping On is designed to improve strength and balance in elderly people who have had a fall or are fearful of falling. Ms Formosa, who is a trained sewing teacher, has made over 13 wedding dresses and insists she still enjoys sewing and cooking. The centenarian wakes up at 5am every morning and attributes her longevity and wellness to her fitness as she lives a life with a kind heart free of jealousy and prays daily.

"Apple made significant improvements to the battery life of its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, but they still fail to last more than a full day with typical usage. To address these issues, the tech giant is recruiting for battery and power software experts. At least nine job listings have been spotted on the firm's official recruitment site as the company looks to boost the battery across its range of mobiles and laptops. Fan site AppleInsider has spotted nine job listings on Apple's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries. These include one for an iOS battery life software engineer (pictured left) and another for iOS software power systems engineer (pictured right) The job listings were discovered by fan site AppleInsider and include listings for an iOS battery life software engineer, a software power systems engineer, battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer. In particular, the iOS software power systems engineer role said the successful candidate 'will be working on design and development of software for triage of battery life issues, modeling of power consumed by different parts of the system, and analytics to understand large scale battery life trends.' Apple defines the Apple Watch battery on its Watch product page. It says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use. All-day battery life: This includes 90 time checks, 90 notifications, 45 minutes of app use, and a 30-minute workout with music. Audio playback: The battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music. Talk time: Apple said the Watch can be used for up to three hours for calls. Workout: During this test the Watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on. Watch: When used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour. Power reserve: When the Apple Watch's battery  gets low it switches into Power Reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour. Charging time: The company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the Watch to 80% and 2.5 hours for a full charge. Apple's tests were carried out in March 2015 with a pre-production Apple Watch and software paired with an iPhone using pre-production software. Apple said battery life varies with environmental factors, use, configuration, and 'many other factors' so actual results will vary . As the site suggests, this shows Apple is looking to boost the battery on iOS devices but also its range of MacBooks. Apple's larger iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what 'normal usage' is and this can differ from person to person. These times have only been beaten by Samsung's latest Galaxy S6. Apple also said its new 12-inch MacBook uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and could last more than nine hours on a single charge. However, official figures suggest its Watch in particular will struggle to last for anywhere near that long. Boss Tim Cook said at the launch event last month that the Watch will last 18 hours, but this only includes 90 time checks, 90 notifications, 45 minutes of app use, and a 30-minute workout with music. Apple is expected to launch an iPhone 6S, 6S Plus as well as potentially a four-inch model later this year. Battery improvements could be made to these handsets, or they may be a feature on next year's iPhone 7. Alternatively, because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer, these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an iOS upgrade. Earlier this week Atmel released its latest  microcontrollers (MCUs) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can harvest energy from a person's body. The  SAM L microcontrollers are part of Atmel's 32-bit ARM-based MCU range and are powered by chip maker ARM's Cortex M0+ 32-bit processors. A number of Apple devices, including the iPhone 5S and iPad Air are powered by chips based around ARM technology. Atmel said its MCUs extend 'battery life from years to decades, reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms, healthcare, medical, wearable, and devices placed in rural, agriculture, offshore and other remote areas.' Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what 'normal usage' is and this can differ from person to person. Apple also said its new 12-inch MacBook (pictured) uses 30% less energy than previous models .

They use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made. The microcontrollers run on the firm's picoPower technology and Atmel's Event System that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks. By effectively 'sharing' energy, the whole device uses less power and, subsequently, less battery. It can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible. Plus, the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature. Earlier this week Atmel released its latest microcontrollers (MCUs) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person's body. Atmel said its MCUs extend 'battery life from years to decades, reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices' During a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year's CES, Andreas Eieland, Atmel's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel. This panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .","AppleInsider spotted nine listings in the past month relating to batteries .

"A 12-year-old Israeli girl is missing after a tour boat she was on exploded and caught fire off Thailand's southwestern coast on its way to Phuket. The youngster was thought to have been in the toilet on board the Ao Nang Princess 5 ferry which was carrying more than 100 people, including many foreign tourists, when the incident happened at around 3.30pm local time. Passengers were throwing themselves into the Andaman Sea after the engine exploded and flames ripped through the boat, according to the Bangkok Post. Photos taken by rescuers, including the Krabi Marine Police, showed the abandoned vessel burning down almost to the waterline before sinking. The Ao Nang Princess 5 ferry burns after the engine exploded in the Andaman Sea in Krabi province. A 12-year-old Israeli girl who was reportedly in the toilet at the time is still thought to be missing . Thick black smoke can be seen rising from the stricken vessel. Between 100 and 110 passengers and crew had to be rescued by a dozen fishing trawlers, speed boats and rescue craft . The Associated Press reported that the 12-year-old girl may have been picked up by another boat that was going to the beach resort of Phuket. But Police Captain Sutthiwat Aunsiam, a duty officer at Muang Krabi station, told Jor Sor 100 radio late in the evening that rescue units are still searching for the girl and Krabi Governor Songpol Sawasditham confirmed her disappearance, according to Thai Rath Online. Most of the passengers and crew, totalling between 100 and 110, were taken back to Ao Nang near the resort town of Krabi from where the Ao Nang Princess 5 originally set off. About a dozen fishing trawlers, speed boats and rescue craft from police and marine authorities assisted in the rescue operation. More rescue staff and divers, including personnel from Third Naval Area Command, will join the search for the missing girl tomorrow. None of those brought ashore were reported to be injured, but one person aboard the boat did die, according to Phuket News. Pol Capt Sutthiwat quoted Wirat Jittaraporn, the captain of the 35-metre long, 4.5-metre wide ferry, as saying the vessel was about five miles from Railay beach near Ao Nang when he heard an explosion from the engine room. He immediately ordered everyone to don life jackets and prepare to abandon ship. The fire quickly engulfed the ferry and burned it to the waterline before it sank at around 6pm off Krabi's Noppharat Thara beach. Photos taken by rescuers, including the Krabi Marine Police, showed the abandoned vessel burning down almost to the waterline before sinking . Passenger Panupon Rattanakornpanya, 44, told Thai Rath Online, that crew members told him and his wife and child that a fire had broken out and ordered everyone to gather at the bow. 'The fire then grew stronger. Everyone was in a panic. Some were crying. Many grabbed jackets and passed them on to others before we jumped into the water,' he said. Governor Songpol said the ferry was equipped with fire extinguishers, 'but in this case it appeared [the crew] were not able to control the blaze and this must be investigated again'. The governor went to Ao Nang, a popular hopping off point for Phi Phi, Phuket, Koh Lanta and other islands, as passengers from the sunken vessel milled on the shore. 'We hope the girl is still alive,' said the Director of Marine Office 5 for the region, Wichai Kamwong, according to Phuketwan . 'The ferry burned with remarkable speed so to have the speedboats and fishing trawlers close by to help was wonderful.' The sunken ferry was operated by Ao Nang Travel and Tour Co. Thailand's tourist industry, which welcomes more than 20 million people a year, has suffered a black eye in recent years due to domestic political violence and several high-profile killings and unexplained accidental deaths of Westerners, but serious marine accidents are uncommon.","Ao Nang Princess 5 ferry was in Andaman Sea on way from resort of Krabi .

"A mum is outraged after she claims her son was turned away from a Qantas flight due to his autism. Gizelle Laurente had booked her son, Jacob Prien, on a flight from Darwin to Brisbane yesterday, so he could spend Easter with his father and younger brother. However, Ms Laurente feared Jacob's dreams had been shattered, when she was told her son would not be able to fly with the airline's unaccompanied minors service. Gizelle Laurente said her son, Jacob, was not allowed to board a flight from Darwin to Brisbane because of his autism . Gizelle Laurente, couldn't afford to fly with him, said the captain of the flight came to meet Jacob at the boarding gate, according to the NT News. Ms Laurente said she then told the captain her son had been given a higher dose of his usual medication, which a doctor told her would help ensure he was calm throughout the flight. She also had a letter from her son's paediatrician, but Jacob was not allowed to board the flight. When asked by a friend what sparked the outburst, she replied: 'Discriminated Jake. Wouldnt let him onboard because hes Autistic/Adhd. He had already taken his Ritalin which he is not required to take out of school hours or on weekends or on holidays. Its more for concentration. But administered it to make them Qantas happy but still not good enough. Cruel. So cruel.' Jacob was booked to fly to Brisbane so he could spend the Easter Weekend with his father and younger brother . Qantas said he was not able to fly because it had not been given the required paperwork to clear an unaccompanied child . 'The pilot told me unless you buy a ticket and travel with your son he won't be flying,' she said. 'I explained that I couldn't afford a ticket and he said 'well I'm sorry your son can't board'. 'I was heartbroken for him, I just started crying.' Ms Laurente later attacked the airline on her Facebook page, where she said it 'can suck a big fat one'. 'The pilot told me unless you buy a ticket and travel with your son he won't be flying,' Ms Laurente said . However, Qantas said it had not in any way discriminated against Ms Laurente and her son, and said Jacob was not allowed on the flight because he had not been cleared by their medical team. 'The health and safety of our passengers is our foremost concern at all times,' a spokeswoman said in a statement. 'The crew sought professional medical advice and took the decision not to allow travel until further information about the condition could be gathered to make sure there was no risk to the passenger,' Qantas said . Jacob was given the all-clear by Qantas, and on Friday morning he flew to Brisbane for the weekend . 'In this case, the crew sought professional medical advice and took the decision not to allow travel until further information about the condition could be gathered to make sure there was no risk to the passenger. 'The crew had the passenger's best interests in mind and there was absolutely no intention to cause distress or discriminate in any way.' Standard procedure for such flights is that medical documents, such as those presented by Ms Laurente, would be given to Qantas a few days in advance of the trip or when tickets are bought. Jacob was given the all-clear to travel today, and made it to Brisbane in time to spend the Easter Weekend with his dad.","Mum says her son was banned from Qantas flight due to his autism .

"A man awaiting sentencing for murder escaped from a jail in eastern Illinois Wednesday after beating a guard into unconsciousness, taking his keys and uniform and speeding off in his SUV. Kamron T. Taylor, who has a history of escape attempts, fled from the Jerome Combs Detention Center in Kankakee at about 3 a.m. He somehow escaped from his cell, hid inside the facility, then beat and choked the guard who was making rounds, said Kankakee County Sheriff Timothy Bukowski. Taylor, a 23-year-old from Kankakee, is considered armed and dangerous, the sheriff said. He was convicted of first-degree murder in February and faces a sentence of 45 years to life in prison. Scroll down for video . On the run: Convicted murderer Kamron T. Taylor escaped from jail early Wednesday . Not going quietly: In this photo taken in February, Taylor was removed from a Kankakee County courtroom after struggling with the deputies and yelling at the crowd in the gallery after being found guilty of murder . Besides hunting him down, investigators were eager to determine how Taylor got free in what was the first successful escape from the decade-old lockup housing about 450 detainees. Escaped: The 23-year-old Taylor was awaiting sentencing when authorities say he beat a guard into unconsciousness, took his keys and uniform and sped off in his SUV . 'The speculation on my part is somebody didn't do their job properly,' Bukowski said. After getting free of his two-man cell in a lockdown unit, Taylor hid out and attacked the guard, a military veteran with 10 years of correctional experience, Bukowski said. By wearing the guard's uniform, Taylor was able to fool other guards in a master control room who opened three sets of doors for him after visual verification by surveillance video, Bukowski said. Once outside, the suspect repeatedly pressed the guard's key fob to locate his Chevrolet Equinox in a parking lot and drive away. Authorities didn't learn of the escape until about 30 minutes later, when jail staff found the wounded officer, who is hospitalized in intensive care with head wounds. 'He was in and out of consciousness, unable to understand the questions that were given to him,' Bukowski said of the guard at a news conference. A few hours after sunrise, officers found the abandoned SUV in a residential area of Kankakee and approached the vehicle with their guns drawn. But Taylor was nowhere to be found and it wasn't clear whether he fled on foot or someone picked him up in another vehicle, the sheriff said. At one point Wednesday, authorities issued an alert for a 15-year-old girl, Savannah Bell, who they believed was with Taylor. Illinois State Police later announced the girl had been found, but did not say where or how officials found her or whether she had been with Taylor. Wanted: A $1,000 reward is being offered by police for any information that leads to Taylor's capture . Dangerous: A woman rushes to her car in Kankakee, Ill., Wednesday, April 1, 2015, after being told by police that officers were searching in the area for prison escapee Kamron T. Taylor . Following the trail: Police approach a vehicle with guns drawn that convicted murderer Kamron T. Taylor stole during his escape . Safe and well: Authorities say they’ve found a 15-year-old girl, Savannah Bell, who they had thought to be in the company of convicted murderer who escaped from jail. Jail staffing levels and procedures will be re-examined, but Bukowski said Taylor's history of violence and previous escape attempts didn't necessarily single him out for stricter security measures. 'It raises an alert, I guess,' he said. 'But you figure the people that are locked up in our facility aren't altar boys and you take certain precautions for all of them. And you can't become complacent with anybody ... especially a murderer.' During his trial in February, Taylor tried to escape from the courthouse minutes after hearing the guilty verdict. Several sheriff's deputies and bailiffs wrestled him to the ground, and Taylor shouted expletives at the gallery as they led him away, according to a report in The (Kankakee) Daily Journal. He also escaped briefly after his arrest in 2013 but was detained several blocks away, the newspaper reported at the time. Taylor was found guilty of the June 2013 shooting death of 21-year-old Nelson Williams Jr. during a botched robbery at Williams' home in Kankakee.

"A former immigration consultant attempted to lure female clients into his home to perform sexual favours for him, a court has heard. Hakaoro Hakaoro was sentenced to 20 months in jail in January 2014 for working without a licence. This week the 55-year-old has been found guilty of six new complaints by the Immigration Advisors Disciplinary Tribunal. The shocking new allegations include inviting women into his house to enter a sexual relationship with him as well asking them to carry out household duties, reports NZ Herald. Former immigration minister Hakaoro Hakaoro, who was jailed in January 2014 for working without a license, has been found guilty of another string of complaints . Hakaoro took $3,000 from two siblings who wanted help with their immigration status. When the visa applications were denied, he dishonestly told them Immigration New Zealand was still considering their visas. Acting on his behalf, Hakaoro's wife later asked one of the siblings to move into their house, engage in sexual relations with Hakaoro and perform household jobs for them, but the woman declined. The tribunal has confirmed the new complaints and will wait to see further submissions before deciding upon a penalty. The 55-year-old had his licence was cancelled in 2013 after a string of complaints, such as suggesting to a client he impregnate her as a means of getting a work permit . Hakaoro attempted to dismiss the new complaints on account of being unable to defend himself from prison . Hakaoro had previously tried to have the complaints dismissed on account of not being able to defend himself from prison. The 55-year-old had his licence was cancelled in 2013 after a string of similar complaints, including suggesting to a client he impregnate her as a means of getting a work permit.

"The young Syrian girl pictured surrendering to the camera she mistook for a gun is not the only one traumatised by a short life filled with violence and war. Another little girl was photographed in a Jordanian refugee camp, weeping with fear after mistaking an aid worker's camera for a weapon. The photographer who took the heart-breaking image in November did not grasp how terrified she was until he was editing the photographs. It was then Rene Schulthoff realised the girl - alone and barefoot among the metal huts - was so scared of his camera that 'she raised her hands to surrender because she thought it was a weapon'. Scroll down for video . Terrified: A Red Cross worker has pictured another Syrian girl (pictured) who became scared and raised her arms to surrender after mistaking his camera for a weapon . Heart-breaking: Its emergence follows the now-iconic image of four-year-old Hudea who also surrendered to a camera in a Syrian camp late last year . The young girl in Jordan (pictured) - who ran barefoot through the camp's rocky terrain - became immensely frightened when Rene raised his camera . Traumatised: German Red Cross worker Rene Schulthoff did not realise how scared the girl was until he was editing the photographs later - and broke down into tears . Victims: Oblivious to the girl's fear, he continued to photograph other men, women and children who inhabit the camp after fleeing violence in Syria . Tough life: Mr Schulthoff told MailOnline these children 'grow up in permanent fear and under extremely poor conditions' He told MailOnline: 'I had tears in my eyes when I saw her like that on my computer. I was shocked by her reaction, the fear and seeing her crying... It is a tragedy for this young generation.' 'Instead of playing with friends, they grow up in permanent fear under extremely poor conditions missing almost everything. A childhood of pain tears and sadness.' 'They miss a peaceful happy childhood, kindergartens, education and what they learn currently is that life is pure horror.' The Communications Delegate for the German Red Cross regularly visits the camp which is 62 miles east of the capital Amman, but does not know if the nameless girl is there with her family. She is one of 17,000 living in Azraq camp according to the United Nations Refugee Agency - having fled the brutal war that has plagued Syria for over four years. The pictures showing her torment follow the iconic image of another Syrian girl who 'broke millions of hearts' after surrendering to a different cameraman Osman Sagirli. Yesterday, MailOnline exclusively revealed four-year-old Adi Hudea could now be in the hands of Al Qaeda after her family left the Atmeh refugee camp for Idlib. She, her mother and three siblings had been living in the Syrian camp since the young girl's father was killed in the 2012 Hama massacre. 83-year-old Fatima Bakkar (pictured) is one of 17,000 Syrians who inhabits the Azraq camp which is 62 miles east of Jordan's capital Amman . Sorrow: The life she left behind in Syria is so horrific that she breaks down in tears during an interview about hr escape . New home: The Azraq camp (pictured) is home to a growing number of Syrians fleeing the violence in their country for Jordan, as the brutal civil war there enters its fifth year . But two weeks ago, they made the fateful decision to move south - only for Idlib to fall into the hands of Al Qaeda's brutal Syrian allies just this weekend. The now-iconic picture was taken late last year and went viral when photojournalist Nadia Abu Shaban who is based in Gaza tweeted it last week. Conflict charity War Child says thousands of children carry 'deep trauma from what they have been through inside Syria'. Its Chief Executive Rob Williams told MailOnline: 'One of these children told me that she and her mother had spend two hours picking up the body parts of her little sister who had been hit by shell fire as she played outside. 'This kind of experience can stay with a child and become a dominant part of their consciousness, blocking concentration and coming out as mental flashbacks so intense they induce total terror.' Mr Williams claims their counselling programme helps children regain 'emotional control' but he says for every child they help, 'there are at least 50 others' who need it. A massive number of Syrians have sought refuge in Jordan this month, according to a recent UNHCR report. Around 250 Syrian refugees cross the border every day and in just four days leading up to March 18, over one thousand people had escaped the embattled country for Jordan. The refugees are coming from the embattled northern city of Aleppo and also from the city of Dara'a which borders Jordan in the south of Syria. Grief: Conflict charity War Child says thousands of children carry 'deep trauma from what they have been through inside Syria . Exodus: Around 250 Syrian refugees cross the border every day and in just four days leading up to March 18, over one thousand people escaped the embattled country for Jordan . Arrivals at the Azraq refugee camp said they preferred to stay in the volatile and dangerous city for four years because they did not want to become refugees. But an increasing number of armed attacks, daily shelling and aerial bombardment forced them to flee their homes. One of the camps inhabitants says the situation in Dara'a became too dangerous in November when 'armed groups from all sides' came to the besieged city. 44-year-old Ismael said: 'We kept saying we would give it one more month, but now most of the people in our village have either fled or been killed, so we left.' Despite reaching safety, he remains traumatised by months of insecurity and the agonising decision of leaving behind his 65-year-old mother who can not walk. 'Back in Syria it was so unsafe. We didn't really sleep at night, we just lay in bed with our eyes open. 'So when we got to Jordan, I felt a bit relieved to be safe, but I'm still so worried about my family back home and I have no way to contact them.'","Crying Syrian girl was photographed in Jordanian refugee camp in November .

"Cover your ears now or turn down your volume! This is the moment a disgruntled French Bulldog continually honks a horn after being left alone in a car. Ryan Burns of Eureka, California, said he could barely believe his eyes when he went out to investigate where the beeping was coming from and caught the pooch in action. He swiftly whipped out his camera phone to film the canine at the wheel. Footage shows the animal standing up with his front paws firmly pressed on the horn. He refuses to get down from the device even when the camera zooms in. Burns later uploaded the video clip online with the dog's owner stepping forward. YouTube user Flying Humboldt claims the French Bulldog is his. The 15-year-old said he was with his mother and they left the pet in their SUV with the sunroof slightly ajar.

Surreal sight: Ryan Burns of Eureka, California, said he could barely believe his eyes when he went out to investigate where the beeping was coming from and caught the pooch in action . He added that it was a cool day - around 55 degrees with showers - and the pooch had access to food and water. Burns said that the horn had been blaring on and off for several minutes last Monday before he went to check out what was going on with a colleague. He recalled: 'Following our ears, we walked down the block... to find this critter, who had been left behind and was so totally not having it.' To date Burns' video has been watched more than one million times with many viewers citing it as an example of animal cruelty.

"Two brothers who died after one of the boys shot the other then turned the gun on himself have been laid to rest in a joint funeral. Kevin Pimentel, 12, shot dead his six-year-old brother, Brady, as they made dinner inside their mobile home in Hudson, Florida last week - before shooting his older brother in the leg and then taking his own life. The injured brother, 16-year-old Trevor, attended the boys' funeral at St. James the Apostle Catholic Church in a wheelchair on Wednesday, while his divorced parents, Helen Campochiaro and Luis Pimentel, were seen receiving hugs from well-wishers  before the service. As many as 400 people attended the memorial for the boys, who would've celebrated their birthdays this week; Kevin would have turned 13 on Monday and Brady would have turned seven on Friday, the Tampa Bay Times reported. Loss: Kevin Pimentel, 12, (left) shot dead his six-year-old brother, Brady, (right) before taking his own life in their Florida home as they made dinner last week. The two boys were laid to rest on Thursday . Mourners leave the funeral in Port Richey, Florida as the boys' older brother Trevor Pimentel, 16, who was shot in the leg in the incident, is helped into a waiting limo. The three boys had been home alone at the time . At the service, the Reverend Mike Cormier said the boys were now 'at the world's greatest sleepover'. The youngsters died while they were home with their 16-year-old brother. Their mother, who works two jobs to keep the family afloat, and another brother, 18, were not home at the time. Officials said there was no argument or incident that sparked the gunfire. According to a statement the Pasco County Sheriff's Office released on Thursday, Kevin was making dinner in the family's  home  and asked his older brother, Trevor, to help. Using a gun kept on the top shelf in a closet area of the family's mobile home, Kevin then shot Brady in Brady's room, Trevor told police. After wounding his older brother in the leg, he then turned the gun on himself. The deaths came just one day after their mother, 38, set up an account on gofundme, appealing for support for her family. On the page, she explained she had been left injured and financially drained by a recent car crash and needed to find a new place to live within two weeks. Grief-stricken: The boys' mother Helen Campochiaro is pictured with Kevin (center) and Brady (right). The single mother to four boys was at one of her two jobs at the time of the shootings . Remembered: Flowers and pictures of the boys were displayed inside St. James the Apostle Catholic Church . 'The mother's going through an absolute living hell right now,' Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said the day after the boys died. Authorities said they have found no evidence that child welfare officials or police had ever been called to the home before the shooting. Campochiaro is a hard-working woman who had two jobs so she could take care of her boys and after the car crash, she didn't even go to the hospital because she had to work, Nocco said. On her Facebook page she says that she makes themed cakes and is a seamstress. Helen's sister, Barbara Campochiaro, of Spring Hill, told The Tampa Bay Times the children 'were raised with gun safety' and that Helen owned a firearm, though she was not sure what kind. 'She was a single mom with four boys. Unfortunately, she could only afford to live in a trailer,' Campochiaro said. 'She just had it (a gun) for protection.' Victims: Six-year-old Brady (left) was killed in the shooting, while Trevor, 16 (right), was shot in the leg . The boys' father, Luis Pimentel, said he didn't know his ex-wife, from whom he separated in 2012, kept a weapon in the home. In an interview with Fox13, he said that he had noticed Kevin was becoming withdrawn and no longer wanted to take part in family activities. He said he saw him getting angry at Brady over small things. 'I didn't get into it with Kevin,' he said. 'I didn't want to have any confrontation with him. I let him do what he wanted to do. I should have maybe disciplined him a little more.' He said the boys would spend half of their time with him and he always looked forward to their visits. 'I miss them very much,' he said. 'I love them. I will never forget them. They were my life.' Kevin was in middle school. Brady attended elementary school and Trevor took virtual high school classes at home in the mornings and culinary classes at a technical school in the afternoons. Anger: The boys' father, Luis Pimentel, said he had noticed Kevin getting angrier and more withdrawn . Scene: The shooting unfolded in the family's mobile home at the Sugar Lane park mobile home in Hudson . 'Me and my boys have had to start over from uncontrolled circumstances,too many times,' she wrote on the gofundme page. 'Divorce,theft, abuse ... I have sold almost everything I own to make a better life for my boys,more than once.' Campichiaro also alluded to having to leave her children at home while she worked. 'I regretfully feel like I never see my boys,' she wrote. 'They are so good and so understanding.They do more than their share at home and for me.Least I can do is put them in a good home.I believe in paying it forward and try to do my part everyday.' The page has raised nearly $7,000. Friends of Campachiaro have set up a separate fundraiser for her on Give Forward, which has already received more than $13,000 in donations. 'She is a devoted mom, an extremely hard worker, and an incredible business woman,' the page says of Campachiaro. 'Please help raise money for her family, for her son in the hospital recovering, and many, many expenses. Two of her sons were killed while she was at work, anything helps.'

"A pregnant mother with a rare form of dwarfism has revealed the physical challenges of raising her three-year-old son - who is more than half her size - while preparing for the arrival of her second child. Tiffanie DiDonato, from Swansboro, North Carolina, was born with diastrophic dysplasia and underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries as a child so she would grow to be 4'10 tall, instead of her previous height of 3'8, which is how tall her son Titan currently is. But even with the additional inches, parenting a rambunctious toddler can be difficult for the 34-year-old mom who has certain physical limitations, and often has to use crutches, or sometimes a wheelchair, in addition to being three months pregnant. 'Titan is a typical kid – he wants to do what he wants to do,' she told People of her son. 'And chasing him outside or across the street is not an option for me.' Helping hand: Tiffanie DiDonato, who has diastrophic dysplasia, a rare form of dwarfism, can be seen grocery shopping with her three-year-old son Titan, who is more than half her size, but always willing to assist her . Making it work: The 34-year-old mom from Swansboro, North Carolina, is 4'10 tall and is constantly re-teaching herself to walk because of the stiff muscles and arthritis, which are side effects of her dwarfism . Tiffanie, who married to Eric Gabrielse, a 6’1, 29-year-old Marine who is 6'0, explained that she has to get creative when it comes to dealing with her son - especially when he throws himself on the floor and cries. When tantrums occurs she will walk way and say: 'Mommy can't help when you're yelling at me... No crying and Mommy can help.' Tiffanie noted that this trick, which she has developed over time, usually prompts her son to get up and give her a hug. 'I try my best to let him know throwing tantrums doesn't get you very far - a great lesson to learn, don't you think?' she said. Great news: Tiffanie and her husband Eric Gabrielse, a 29-year-old Marine, are expecting their second child in September . All smiles: Titan happily cuddled up to his dad for this snapshot . Full of life: The three-year-old had a laugh while his dad Eric enjoyed his breakfast . Tiffanie, who co-wrote the memoir Dwarf with Rennie Dyball, has difficulty lifting Titan now that is getting taller because her arms are significantly shorter than most moms. The stiff muscles and arthritis that are side effects of her condition mean that she has to constantly re-teach herself how to walk - which makes chasing after Titan impossible. Losing control of her son is one of her greatest fears, which is why she avoids leaving the house with Titan when she doesn’t her husband Eric or another family member by her side. 'I have even watched Eric struggle to catch him outside and he's a Marine!' she explained. ‘We named Titan correctly, because he's almost too speedy and too athletic.' Because she 'wouldn't stand a chance' against outracing her son, she makes sure she stays '10 steps ahead of the game' at all times. Overcoming obstacles: Tiffanie can be seen as a child wearing braces on her legs. She underwent numerous limb-lengthening surgeries when she was younger . Painful choice: Tiffanie was expected to be 3'8 tall, but her surgeries allowed her to grow to 4'10, enabling her to be more independent . Tiffanie recalled times in which Titan has climbed into the dryer or wedged himself behind the couch or plopped himself inside the sink. Without physically being able to get him out on her own, she has to rely on her own quick thinking, as well as game she made up to ensure his cooperation. She explained that when she sings: 'One, two, three, help me!' and reaches out for Titan, he will take her hands and pull himself up and out of whatever precarious situation he has gotten himself into. Titan's willingness to lend his mom a helping hand is one of the reasons she is confident that he will be a fantastic big brother. 'He really is - whether he is intentionally doing so or no - becoming my little helper,' she said. 'We conquer the day-to-day challenges together, and I hope we always do.' Sweet moment: Tiffanie and Titan snuggled up together on the couch before he fell asleep . Support system: Tiffanie wore a yellow halter dress while posing for this photo with a friend . Sports fans: Eric and Tiffanie smiled for the camera at a Red Sox game at Yankee Stadium in New York City .","Tiffanie DiDonato, from Swansboro, North Carolina, was born with diastrophic dysplasia and is only 4'10 tall .

"Former paramedic Crsity Collins had admitted that she used ice while driving and treating patients in an effort to raise awareness about the damaging drug . A former ice addict, who worked as a paramedic while high on the drug, has made her story public in an attempt to raise awareness of the illegal substance and the lack of support available for its victims. Crsity Collins was using crystal meth every day and spending up to $500 a week to keep up her drug habit. The 30-year-old, who took herself to the emergency room six times while suffering drug induced psychosis, has slammed health services for failing to offer her support despite claiming on numerous occasions that bugs were eating her eyes. 'Because I was awake all the time I had a staph infection, but I actually believed I might have bugs in my eyes and when I went to hospital, I was having drug-induced psychosis, I would say I had mites in my eyes or fleas or bugs, ' Ms Collins told Daily Mail Australia. 'Not once was I ever asked ""are you on meth or taking drugs or are you having a drug induced psychosis"" or ""should we get a social worker or a psych assessment"". 'I don't know if they were trying to protect me because I was in the ambulance service, but either way they shouldn't have been protecting me because firstly, I was dealing with people and patients and secondly, like anyone else I deserve the best treatment and care. 'I should have never been allowed to be released so many times without a psych consultation or councillor.' The 30-year-old said she was never offered support despite checking herself into the emergency room on six occasions (right) while claiming that she had bugs in her eyes (left) 'I should have never been allowed to be released so many times without a psych consultation or councillor,' she said . Ms Collins, whose addiction was fuelled by her post traumatic stress disorder and a borderline personality disorder, first began using illegal drugs recreationally, and first tried meth, while living in Darwin. However her habit ironically escalated when she attempted to escape the city an its 'party scene' by moving back to Launceston in Tasmania, where she rekindled a relationship with an ex-boyfriend who was part of 'the same sort of scene'. 'I didn't have any friends that weren't using drugs. Everyone had it around. Pills weren't easy to come across in Launceston, it was always speed and then ice took over,' Ms Collins said. 'It made me feel like superwoman - I could do anything and run on barely any sleep, so it became something I was using on a very frequent basis. 'You could be on top of everything even while lacking sleep - long night shifts, day shifts, I could study for hours when I came home, dinner would be done, the house would be clean - and it became a way to cope with these mental illnesses that I didn't know I had.' Ms Collins has now been clean for nine months after seeking help from the Department of Veterans Affairs . She said that it was when she and her now ex-boyfriend broke up that she became a daily user of the drug, even when driving and treating patients as an ambulance worker, but that none of her colleagues appeared to notice. 'I never felt affected. I never had any close calls where I could have put someone in danger. I was always very good at my job, very on the ball with patient care, and that why I was never suspected,' Ms Collins said. 'When I look back, I find it absolutely disgraceful. I could have had psychosis at any stage or changed my awareness or sense of judgement - it's such an unpredictable drug. 'I'd hate to know that anyone I know was being taken care of by someone that is hungover or on any form of drug that would alter their sense of awareness, let alone ice. 'But it wasn't until I started taking lots of sick days because my eyes were flaring-up form being awake all the time that anyone noticed something was wrong, and even then it was like they were more worried that I wouldn't have any leave left rather than that my health was deteriorating.' Sores from obsessive picking: She said that traking the drug used to make her feel 'like superwoman' Ms Collins has now been clean for more than nine months after finding free help with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which she was directed to by pure chance after being arrested. 'I was on my way to a dealer's house and got pulled over. My car was raided and they found drugs and when then let me out on bail to appear at court, a police officer who was a reservist said ""you need to get yourself together"" and told me to see Veterans Affairs,' she said. Unlike at the single out-patient facility in Launceston, which was run by nurses and social workers but had no councillors, Ms Collins found intensive help that assessed the root of her drug addiction and uncovered her mental health problems. She now has effective strategies in place with her councillor to deal with her borderline personality disorder and anxiety, which used to lead her to take drugs as a coping mechanism, as well as the post-traumatic stress disorder she acquired while working in Iraq as a medic for six months. 'You could be on top of everything even while lacking sleep - long night shifts, day shifts, I could study for hours when I came home, dinner would be done, the house would be clean - and it became a way to cope with these mental illnesses that I didn't know I had,' Ms Collins said . 'I was partially stressed [while in Iraq] because I was the only female in that group, so I didn't want to make mistakes and I wanted to fit in with the men,' she said. 'Then there was the constant artillery and bombings we'd get in the compound… it didn't feel like it affected me there, but when I came back I would hear loud bands and instantly hide or duck for cover. I'd be constantly looking for bombs on the side of the roads, it was a habit there and when I got home I couldn't get out of it.' She is not living with her family who provide her with emotional and finical support after she left her job and isolated herself from damaging social groups, and is actively looking for her next line of work. Ms Collins wants to use her story to raise awareness about the 'epidemic of ice users' in Tasmania, where she said middle and higher class users were very common . 'In Tasmania there is becoming an epidemic of ice users and ice related crime, so if it can help even just a few people, then I'm more than happy to share my story,' she said. 'It's not just the lower socio-economic groups in society that we should concentrate on, it's happening everywhere - the drug doesn't discriminate and it's happening in the higher class and the middle classes. You need to have money to use it. 'There's no drug testing in people that we hold in high regards, like paramedics, police and firies - pilots have to have drug tests and paramedics should be made to have these tests too.'","Cristy Collins worked for the Tasmanian Ambulance Service in Launceston .

"'Welcome to the Land of GNH' was blazoned across the poster in front of me as I stepped off the plane at Paro airport. I had just landed in Bhutan, where Gross National Happiness is considered far more important than Gross Domestic Product and economic success.It certainly gave me food for thought. Before we had even touched down, I knew I was visiting somewhere unique. Miles of prayer flags lined the runway and instead of a soulless modern airport, the terminal had whitewashed walls and carved casement windows painted with ornate motifs. The only billboard showed a glamorous young couple, the fifth king and his queen, looking as if they had stepped out of a Bollywood movie. Tiger's Nest Monastery is the most sacred site in the Buddhist country of Bhutan and was built in the 8th century . Tashi, my guide for the week, was there to meet me, placing a white scarf around my neck as a sign of welcome. He was wearing the ubiquitous national dress, a knee-length wrap-over tunic hitched up by a wide belt. Women were elegantly attired in long sarongs with silk jackets and embroidered scarves. This tiny Himalayan kingdom, wedged between Tibet and India, is a land of myths and magic - a Shangri-La where, as legend has it, tigers fly through the air and witches reside in ancient forests. Buddhism lies at the heart of society. Houses are decorated with dragons, animals and phallic symbols to guard against malicious thoughts, and Buddhist monuments, known as stupas, are erected near rivers to defy the evil spirits that lurk beneath the water. Massive dzongs, medieval monastic fortresses, tower over the valleys and shrines containing gilded prayer wheels are dotted across the hillsides. Prayer flags decorate many place sin the religious country which measures its success with a Gross National Happiness index . Tiger's Nest, the most sacred site in the country, is perched precipitously on a narrow ledge high above the Paro Valley. It was a hard, three-hour slog through dense woodland to reach the diminutive temple and I was left gasping in the rarefied air - but it was worth the effort. I found myself walking through a canopy of brilliantly coloured prayer flags in the midst of sheer cliffs and deep gorges where Spanish moss lay draped over the pine trees like frayed silk. Accommodation ranged from spanking-new hotels to delightful family-run guest houses where I'd curl up in front of the wood-burning stove in the cosy bedrooms. Once the sun went down, the temperature plummeted. A traditional hot stone bath was an ideal way to keep warm during the chilly evenings and had the added bonus of supposedly curing aches and pains. At the Hotel Olathang in Paro, I gently lowered myself into a scorching steamy pool heated by white-hot river rocks that released minerals into the water. Afterwards I felt so relaxed that I fell asleep at dinner. Colour and joy seem to reign in Bhutan, particularly during festivals such as this one in the Bhumthang Valley . Travelling around the country isn't easy. With many roads closed for repairs for several hours a day, a 50-mile journey can take up to five hours. Mountain Kingdoms (www.mountainkingdoms.com, 01453 844400) offers small group breaks to Bhutan. A 12-day tailor-made Gentle Walking Bhutan holiday costs from £2,475 including return flights from Kathmandu to Paro, domestic flight, all travel and full-board accommodation in Bhutan with guide, plus two nights at Dwarika's Hotel, Kathmandu.

Sometimes whole tracts of land had been washed away and we ended up driving across mudslides and along narrow dirt tracks with dizzying drops just inches from the car. But the views were sublime. Far below, silver rivers snaked through the terraced farmland, while on the horizon, jutting above the swirling mists, were ranges of shimmering peaks. Wild yaks grazed on the high grassland while monkeys squatted beside the bamboo in the sub-tropical valleys. Now and again we'd stop in remote hill villages and snack on freshly cooked momo dumplings stuffed with fried onions which Tashi bought at the market stalls. We feasted on more local fare at our daily picnics, tasting spicy noodles and deep-fried pakora with chilli cheese - the eye-watering national dish. After a hike along the Chokshor Chu river in Bumthang, we stopped for lunch in front of the head lama's house surrounded by his dogs and cats while his wife brought us dry roasted rice. We shared the picnic with half a dozen of their rosy-cheeked grandchildren.The Bhutanese everywhere were hospitable and welcoming. In the Phobjikha Valley, I was invited into a traditional farmhouse, climbing a roughly hewn ladder to the first-floor living quarters, passing trays of sliced turnips and red chillis laid out to dry. Zam, the farmer's wife, insisted I try her home-brewed Ara, an alcohol made from distilled wheat, while I sat on the kitchen floor. It tasted as sweet as ginger wine.The valley is famous for the blacknecked cranes that spend the winter there after a flight over the Himalayas from the Tibetan Plateau. Morning light on the village of Gangtey, situated at the head of the Phobjikha Valley . I gazed enthralled as they greeted each other, puffing up their feathers while they danced and bowed to their mates At the nearby monastery in Gangtey, we joined hundreds of local families at the Black-Necked Crane Festival, timed to coincide with the annual migration. There was a festive atmosphere as people jostled for space in the open-air courtyard. I squeezed past them to watch masked dancers dressed in flamboyant brocade robes and headgear adorned with peacock feathers. Further east, the magnificent dzong at Trongsa is set on a pinnacle of rock at the head of three valleys. It is one of the largest in the country, with a whole city contained within its walls. I was soon lost in a labyrinth of staircases, courtyards and temples. Two Buddhist monks chatting against the imposing backdrop of Trongsa Dzong (left) while a mountain Dzong is equally as elaborate . I removed my shoes to circumambulate the huge prayer wheels before entering one of the dimly lit shrine rooms where every inch of wall space was covered in exquisite frescoes of gods and demons.Pilgrims prostrated themselves in front of a huge golden statue illuminated by hundreds of flickering butter lamps while red-robed monks sat crosssweet legged, mumbling prayers in a hypnotic chant accompanied by the sound of tinkling bells and clashing cymbals. On our final flight back to Paro we were joined by a serene young monk and his entourage. It transpired he was one of Bhutan's highest lamas and the reincarnation of Khyentse Rinpoche, the Dalai Lama's spiritual teacher. The red carpet was rolled out for him to board the plane before he blessed us all with hands clasped together in prayer. It really was a fitting end to this enchanting holiday.","Bhutan measures its success with a Gross National Happiness Index instead of using GDP .

"A Massachusetts man is facing charges in connection after severed human body parts were discovered inside a discarded duffel bag near the campus of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Carlos Colina, 32, pleaded not guilty in Cambridge District Court to charges of being an accessory after the fact to assault, battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body. He is being held on $1million bail. Remains, including a torso and limbs, first were found in a duffel bag discarded outside the building of technology company Biotech Saturday morning, according to police. Scroll down for video . Carlos Colina, left, faces charges of accessory after the fact to an assault, battery and improper disposal of a body. Above, he speaks during his attorney during his arraignment . Colina was arrested Sunday after severed human body parts were discovered in a duffel bag and a human head was found in his apartment building's recycling bin . The head of victim Jonathan Camilien, 26, of Somerville, was found in a recycling bin in Colina's apartment building across the street, according to the police report. Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan says the death is considered a homicide, though Colina has not been charged with murder. 'We are not seeking anyone else in connection with the discovery of these human remains,' she said Monday. A saw, rope and cleaning supplies were found in Colina's apartment, which is located one block from the Cambridge Police Department. 'We're confident that this was not a random act,' Haas said. The suspect had wounds on his face and neck and a vacuum could be heard during the search when police discovered the victim's head, according to the Boston Globe. Colina had wounds on his face and neck and a vacuum could be heard during the search when police discovered the victim's head . Authorities have said that the death is considered a homicide, though Colina has not been charged with murder . The relationship between the victim and suspect was not immediately known, though Camilien and Colina were known to each other. A motive was not disclosed, . Both their families were in court on Monday. According to the investigation, a neighbor reported hearing an argument coming from Colina's apartment Friday night, while Colina and Camilien were last seen returning to the building just after 11 pm Friday. A man now identified as Colina was seen in surveillance video from nearby Biogen offices exiting the apartment building at about 4.15 a.m. Saturday carrying a duffel bag, authorities said. He returned to the apartment building empty handed. Defense attorney John Cunha Jr. called it a sensational case. 'Obviously the circumstances of the case are sensational enough,' he said. 'I'm not going to exacerbate it.' He later called it 'a sad situation.' Colina has another assault and battery case currently pending against him where the victim is not Camilien.","Carlos Colina, 32, pleads not guilty to battery, improper disposal of body .

"Tasers are supposed to offer people protection, but for one dim-witted youngster there was one person even the most powerful stun gun couldn't protect him against - himself. Dangelo Conner, from New York, filmed himself messing around with the powerful weapon in a friend's apartment, first waving it around, then sending volts coursing through a Coke can. But his antics all went horribly wrong after he decided to electrocute a metal bracelet while he was still holding it, sending the current through his hand and into his body. Dangelo Connor, from Brooklyn, New York, filmed himself messing around with a powerful stung gun. He first electrocuted a Coke can, but his antics all went horribly wrong when he zapped a bracelet he was holding . Proving that the weapon lives up to its reputation, he is instantly laid out on the floor, his muscles twitching uncontrollably, while his two friend laugh in the background. Since Dangelo, who also goes by the name of Mikkey, posted the footage on his Facebook page the video has gone viral, being viewed more than 17million times. Users have branded the video 'hilarious', while one girl Kayla Chambers said it was the 'best thing I ever seen'. However not everyone has been supportive. Michael Salami Dinh branded Dangelo a 'useless waste of space', while Dustin Carroll added: 'What a dumbass.' After the current passes through the bracelet and into him, Deangelo collapses on the floor and begins twitching uncontrollably while his friends laugh in the background .","Dangelo Conner, from New York, was messing around with stun gun .

"A new sexual technique that aims to teach women how to 'expand the sweet spot' experienced during orgasm has swept into the UK. Orgasmic meditation, shortened to OM, is a practice that marries sex with mindfulness and, according to its founders, encourages 'connection, vitality and wellness' and 'cultivates a greater connection' between partners. The practice, which was founded by US entrepreneur Nicole Daedone, borrows much of its philosophy from yoga and meditation. Director of OneTaste, Justine Dawson (seated on the sofa), is shown guiding a couple through orgasmic meditation, which aims to teach couples how to enable women to orgasm more deeply . Orgasmic meditation involves the light stimulation of a woman's clitoris for 15 minutes without interruption . According to teachers of OM, it involves the light stimulation of a woman's clitoris for 15 minutes without interruption. The aim is not necessarily to orgasm but simply to 'feel' the sensation as intensely as possible. Usually practiced in pairs, there is a 'strokee' and a 'stroker'. OM-ing affects the same parts of the human brain as conventional meditation. Daedone first taught orgasmic meditation in the US in 2001 and since then the craze has spread around the world. There are currently over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 in the UK alone. There are also 30 dedicated orgasmic meditation centres across the globe. OM can be led in classes or with an individual trainer, if those attending desire a more private setting. In the classes, which cost £195 for a seven-hour session, attendees can be couples or singles. The director of the US company OneTaste, which has brought the sessions to the UK via affiliate company TurnON Britain, says the demographic on classes are surprisingly mixed. Justine Dawson told FEMAIL: 'All kinds of people come to the courses - people in their 20s through their 70s and even into their 80s. She continues: '[It's a mixture of] Singles and couples. Some couples who have been together for a year, others for 30 years. There are all kinds of professional backgrounds - doctors, teachers, programmers, managers, artists, therapists. 'I would say that most people are 25-55, 70 per cent are single, 30 per cent are couples. All who come share a common desire to experience greater connection in their lives.' Your average Brit might find the thought of disrobing in front of others for such an intimate encounter mortifying but Dawson believes that most people can get over the embarrassment if they feel they're gaining a valuable experience. She says: 'When it comes to discussions of orgasm, relationship and connection, I believe that most people are shy. 'But people come to the class regardless, because they know that good things take practice and just like your health or career, it's worth putting time and effort into your sex and relationships, even if it means being a little uncomfortable!' The aim of the £195 class is to help women prolong the 'sweet spot' when orgasming. There are currently 2,000 people  practicing the method in the UK, according to Turn On Britain . Director of US company OneTaste, Justine Dawson, says her aspirations for the practice are that it becomes second nature to mention OM alongside yoga and meditation . A video from a private class in London, led by Justine Dawson, shows a woman lying on a towel with a pillow behind her head. She is naked from the waist down and a partner sits on the floor by her side. Dawson, who's been teaching OM for eight years, explains: 'It's a 15 minute partner practice that two people can do together to increase connection, vitality, wellness and to cultivate a greater connection between them. 'A woman takes off her pants and lies down. Her partner sits next to her and lightly and deliberately strokes her clitoris for 15 minutes.' Dawson thinks the attraction for OM is that it offers a more conscious approach to sex and relationships. 'I believe there is a growing trend for the practice because our culture as a whole is ready for something different than the sex and relationships that have been ""on the menu"" up until now. She adds: 'We're ready for a different approach. One that is more conscious. People want information on how to do that. And we offer it openly.' Dawson also leads a team of teachers, holding monthly public sessions of up to 50 people in which couples are shown a demonstration, and then can partake themselves. She says she became an OM teacher out of personal interest: 'As someone who had practiced meditation for many years, I was looking for a wellness practice that would enhance my connection with a partner, while deepening my connection to myself. 'As many wellness practices are done in silence or even solitude, I was curious for one that instead could be done in connection, in a way that would enliven my relationships. I started with a class and it turned into my career, much to my surprise.' She hopes that one day OM will be mentioned in the same breath as yoga or meditation, saying: 'Our vision is that people could equally say yoga, meditation, orgasmic meditation.' Orgasmic meditation founder Nicole Daedone hails from California. Before focusing her attentions on orgasmic meditation, the author and entrepreneur was a University Instructor in Semantics and Gender Communication. Daedone first taught orgasmic meditation in the USA in 2001 and since then the craze has spread around the world. There are currently over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 in the UK alone. Vanity Fair named Daedone in its list of 'Twelve Women Who Changed the Way We Look at Sex' and around 900,000 people have viewed her  Ted talk, entitled Orgasm, the Cure for Hunger in Western Woman.","Orgasmic meditation (OM) helps to 'expand' women's climaxes .

"Married father-of-two Steven Christopher Costa, from Devon, plans to head to Iraq to fight against ISIS . A married father-of-two is set to leave his home in Devon to fight against ISIS in Iraq because jihadis 'need to be put down like rabid dogs'. Steven Christopher Costa, 31, plans to head out to the Middle East next month to join the war against the terrorists, leaving his wife and young children behind. Mr Costa, who spent six years in the Navy, will make the 4,000-mile trip after raising the cash to pay for flights. He said: 'When you have a rabid dog, you take it to the vet and put it down. 'Lots of people have said it's an admirable thing I am doing. I think it's a necessary thing.' When he arrives in Iraq, Mr Costa will join up with Kurdish fighters and other foreign ex-servicemen who have joined the battle against the barbaric Islamists. The former seaman was recruited through the Foreign Fighters Against ISIS Facebook group, who help ex-military personnel make the journey to ISIS-controlled territory. He has applied for a visa and plans to fly to northern Iraq via Jordan. Mr Costa said he will take his own life if he is ever captured by the terrorists because he does not want his children to see him being executed in a Jihadi John-style video. 'I will be saving a bullet or keeping a grenade strapped to my chest,' he said. 'If I get captured, I will pull the pin and take my life so there will be nothing for them to parade in any propaganda videos. 'I won't be burnt alive and I certainly won't be beheaded. I don't want my kids to see that in 10 years' time on the internet, because it will still be there. 'I am not going to lie, I am frightened. And anyone who says they are not is lying.' When he arrives in Iraq, Mr Costa will join up with Kurdish fighters and other foreign ex-servicemen who have joined the battle against the barbaric Islamists (file picture) Previous attempts by people to go out to fight ISIS have led to them being arrested for terror offences, but Mr Costa says this will not happen to him. He said: 'I'm going to join the Kurdish Peshmerga - not a terror group - who some European countries are funding and sending weapons to. 'There are a few groups of former soldiers out there so I'll be fine. I'm going as a volunteer, not a mercenary, so I don't think I'll be stopped. I'm not being paid.' The former military man added: 'Not seeing my kids is my biggest fear before death. 'People are going to have to give their lives to stop ISIS and if one of them has to be me, then so be it. Mr Costa (pictured) will leave his wife and children behind to fight against ISIS for three months . 'I am not doing it for any monetary gain and I am not doing it for fame. 'My wife was not impressed when I told her, but she understands. 'The war that's happening over there will happen over here. It's just a matter of how long it will be before it comes here.' Steven said he aims to fight against the extremists for three months before returning to his family. 'If I have committed to something, I have to see it through,' he said. Otherwise it would bug me for the rest of my life.' Terror police warned Mr Costa against the trip but do not have the power to stop him leaving unless they suspect of him of carrying out an offence. Detective Sergeant Martin Lakey from the South West Counter Terrorism Intelligence Unit, said: 'Whilst it is not illegal to travel to countries such as Syria and Iraq, if your activities amount to offences against UK terrorism legislation, you could be prosecuted on return to the UK. 'Where there is a creditable likelihood of any British national travelling to high-risk area including Syria and Iraq, we will try to work with that person to ensure that they are fully aware of the risks, including highlighting the threat of kidnapping, and the effect of their travelling to fight could have on friends and family back in the UK. 'Our security advice is always in line with guidance given out by the Home Office in relation to foreign travel advice to high-risk areas.' Sir Edward Garnier QC, the former Solicitor General, warned last year that Britons who fight against terrorists in the Middle East would be interviewed by the police on their return. He told Radio 4's Today programme: 'We are in a terrible grey area, not least because we don’t know enough about what they are doing. 'The United Kingdom is trying to defeat Isil. But freelancers are not acting on behalf of the United Kingdom. They may well be guilty of murder, or other sorts of crimes, or they might not be guilty of anything. 'It goes to the general story who go abroad to fight in other people’s wars place themselves not only in physical danger, but in that legal limbo land where they could, if they get on the wrong side of this almost invisible line, into trouble when they get home.'","Steven Christopher Costa is set to leave Britain to fight against ISIS in Iraq .

"An experiment on the ISS will investigate whether plants are able to use a sixth sense while in space - a sense of gravity. In the weightless environment of the space station, researchers will monitor how plants grow in a particular direction without a noticeable gravitational pull. The results could help farmers on Earth get a higher crop yield - and may also help future astronauts grow plants on missions beyond Earth orbit to the moon and Mars. An experiment on the ISS will investigate whether plants are able to use a sixth sense while in space - a sense of gravity. Nasa astronaut Karen Nyberg is pictured harvesting plants from a previous Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) investigation of thale cress during Expedition 37 in 2013 . The experiment is being run by researchers at the Japanese space agency (Jaxa). German researchers are currently testing a greenhouse system, which uses recycled urine to manufacture fertiliser. They hope to build a greenhouse in Antarctica to test the first space garden in 2016. The system is being developed at the German Aerospace Center in Bremen, and is called Eden (Evolution and Design of Environmentally-closed Nutrition sources). Funded by Esa, the greenhouses will contain combined life-support systems which use recycled urine to manufacture fertiliser, helping to grow vegetables for a lunar and Mars environment. Scientists from Virginia are also hoping to use meteorite soil to grow everything from asparagus to potatoes. If the study proves successful, it could help humans grow their own food in space, helping in the quest to colonise other planets. Called the Plant Gravity Sensing study, it will be conducted when new supplies are taken to the ISS by a SpaceX Dragon capsule on 13 April. The experiment will examine the cellular process of formation in thale cress, a small flowering plant related to cabbage. Small dishes will hold seedlings, and astronauts on the station will watch how they are able to grow inside the Japanese Kibo module. Scientists will be examining whether a plant’s ability to work out which way it is growing - the gravity sensor - can form in the absence of gravity. It should be noted that there is still gravity on the ISS but, owing to its orbit around Earth, things on the station are in a constant state of free-fall, simulating a zero-gravity environment. In the Kibo module, the plants will be placed in both the micro gravity ISS environment and in a small centrifuge, that can simulate Earth’s gravity. Results will show if the plants can sense changes in gravity, and adapt levels of calcium in their cells to compensate for it. The results could help farmers on Earth get a higher crop yield - and may also help future astronauts grow plants on missions beyond Earth orbit to the moon and Mars (illustration shown) In particular, scientists think particles in plant cells that store and process starch for energy - amyloplast - may form in the direction of gravitational pull. By increasing calcium concentrations, the amyloplast can help the plant grow in a certain direction. Without gravity, though, scientists will be keen to see whether the same components can still assemble to make the plant grow in a certain direction. If the role of amyloplast is proven to be correct, it could mean that plants on Earth could be modified to make them more healthy. And it could also help cultivate healthy plants for consumption on future deep space missions, or even other planets. These culture dishes hold seedlings and the growing medium for the Plant Gravity Sensing investigation, which were used during astronaut training at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s Tsukuba Space Center in March 2014 . The gravity sensor of the plant could be regulated to account for the different gravity on another planet - such as Mars, where it is a third of Earth’s. ‘We may design plants that respond to gravity vector changes more efficiently than wild ones,’ said Dr Hitoshi Tatsumi from the Nagoya University in Japan, who is running the experiment. ‘These plants will recover from collapse by winds or flood more rapidly than wild ones. Thus, the agricultural output of the designed plants will be greatly increased, which may solve, in part, the shortage of crops in the near future.’","Japanese-led experiment will see how plants grow on the ISS .

"A federal judge has ordered the Internal Revenue Service to hand over a list of the 298 tea party organizations that it targeted with broad and often intrusive questions when they applied for nonprofit tax-exempt status. The decision from U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott means right-wing groups are a step closer to being allowed to pursue a class-action lawsuit against the IRS. The agency has admitted playing political favorites with the tax code beginning in 2010, when it began applying extra scrutiny to groups with red-flag words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names. While those organizations' applications were held up for years, liberal groups sailed through the process. Federal tax-exempt status is confered on groups that serve a public purpose, including issue advocacy, and allows them to promise tax deductions to their donors. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . F.U.I.R.S.: American conservatives were up in marks in 2013 after the IRS confirmed it had been slow-walking tax-exemption applications from tea party groups based on red-flag words in their names . Lois Lerner, the former IRS official at the heart of the tea party targeting scandal, ran the 'Exempt Organizations' division until late 2013 when she retired with full benefits; the Justice Department said this week that it won't prosecute her for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions . Tax-exempt organizations are not permitted to work for or against candidates for public office, but they can use up to half of their funds to make public arguments about political matters like tax policy, the Obamacare insurance overhaul, the environment or foreign policy. Dlott agreed this week that the tea party groups suing the government can pursue their claims that the IRS violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights, along with a section of federal law – Section 6103 of Title 26 – that prohibits the government from releasing private information contained in tax returns. When the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General investigated the IRS's actions, it demanded – and received – a list of 298 groups whose tax-exemption applications had been held up. It's this list that the tea party groups want. Their lawsuit aims first to identify a list of 'all dissenting groups targeted for additional scrutiny by the IRS from January 20, 2009, through July 15, 2013.' Dlott could then choose to certify that list as a 'class' of plaintiffs. IRS commissioner John Koskinen has insisted that his agency is no longer targeting conservative groups with special scrutiny, and has offered to green-list any group that promises it will limit its political activity to 40 per cent of its budget – but some organizations are holdout out, claiming the law entitles them to a 50 per cent limit . The IRS's lawyers claimed that they couldn't provide the court with the names of all the groups, saying they would have to turn over the very documents that Section 6103 requires them to keep confidential. The conservative plaintiffs said they would be happy to have only the spreadsheet that the inspector general got from the IRS. Dlott agreed and ordered the agency to hand it over. 'The Court concludes that the return information sought is directly related to the issue of class certification in this federal court proceeding,' her ruling reads. 'The names of the putative class member organizations and their control dates – the date which the putative class member organizations submitted their applications for tax exempt status to the IRS – are directly related to the issue of class certification.' Dlott decided that without the list, the plaintiffs wouldn't be able to show all the disaffected conservative applicants it has already identified share common experiences at the hands of America's tax collectors. Courthouse News Service first reported her ruling. The IRS is the federal agency Americans most love to hate, polling worse in opinion surveys than Congress . A partial list was unearthed by USA Today in September 2013, showing that as of 2011 the IRS had questioned the political advocacy of 162 right-wing organizations and delayed approving their tax exemptions. In an IRS spreadsheet published online by the newspaper, partisan government officials characterized the activities of 21 of those groups as 'propaganda.' Dlott also ordered the IRS to tell the court whether or not that list was authentic, The Washington Times reported. Former IRS official Lois Lerner, who has been at the center of the targeting scandal since it emerged in 23 months ago, was facing the possibility of criminal Contempt of Congress charges until the Obama administration's Department of Justice declined on Monday to prosecute her. Lerner, under subpoena in May 2013, delivered an opening statement professing her innocence during a hearing but then refused to answer questions.","Right-wing groups want court to let them sue the IRS in a class-action lawsuit for violating their constitutional right to equal treatment .

"They are the easy-to-drink cocktails that come in pretty colours and sweet flavours. But don't be fooled by their innocent appearance. These drinks often contain high amounts of alcohol and drinking too many of them can leave your head spinning... or worse. Scroll down for video . Colourful cocktails are deceptively easy to drink but can sometimes contain vast quantities of alcohol . The Zombie is a fruity cocktail made from three different types of rum, lime juice, falernum, Angostura bitters, Pernod, grenadine, cinnamon syrup and grapefruit juice . Made with high-proof alcohol and hardly any mixers, these ten cocktails are sure to floor even the hardiest of drinker. From Jungle Juice and Caribou Lou to Negroni, Death In The Afternoon and Sazerac, Femail reveals the 10 most alcoholic cocktails in the world. According to drinkaware.co.uk, men should not regularly drink more than three to four units of alcohol a day. Women should not regularly drink more than two to three units a day. One alcohol unit  equals one 25ml single measure of spirits. 1. Zombie . A smooth, fruity cocktail originally served heated, the Zombie was concocted in the 1930s by Donn Beach, a restaurant owner in Hollywood. The cocktail's ingredients were a heavily guarded secret. However, according to the original recipe, published in drinks book Sippin' Safari, the drink was made from three different kinds of rum, lime juice, falernum, Angostura bitters, Pernod, grenadine, and 'Don's Mix,' a combination of cinnamon syrup and grapefruit juice. The cocktail is so strong that Don The Beachcomber restaurants limit their customers to two Zombies apiece. What makes this so alcoholic? Three types of rum: 40 per cent ABV . Pernod: 40 per cent ABV . Angostura bitters: 44.7 per cent ABV . 2. Jungle Juice . This cocktail is made fresh fruits which have been steeped overnight in an entirely bottle of grain alcohol before being served up, in the style of punch, to unsuspecting drinkers. The recipe for this particular drink comes from The Bartender’s Black Book by Stephen Kittredge Cunningham. To bring down the alcohol levels, you can add a mixer like lemonade although this is frowned upon. Connoisseurs say that when it is made correctly it doesn't taste anything like alcohol at all. What makes this so alcoholic? 1 litre bottle of grain alcohol: 95 per cent ABV . 3. Death In The Afternoon . A classic concoction of champagne and absinthe, this luxe cocktail was invented by Ernest Hemingway and is also called Hemingway Champagne. Relatively simple to make, the recipe's original instructions appear in 1935 cocktail book and were contributed by Hemingway himself, who wrote: 'Pour one jigger absinthe into a champagne glass. Add iced champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly.' The drink rarely appears on menus but can be ordered from bartenders. What makes this so alcoholic? Absinthe: 45 per cent ABV . Champagne: 12 per cent alcohol . Jungle Juice (left) is made by steeping fruits overnight in 100 per cent grain alcohol.  This Negroni (right) contains equal parts gin, Campari and sweet vermouth . 4. Aunt Roberta . Considered by some to be the strongest cocktail in the world, this drink contains 100 per cent alcohol, with absolutely no mixers. Gin, vodka, absinthe, brandy and blackberry liquor are mixed together in equal parts for a dastardly drink that will certainly pack a punch. According to folklore, the drink was created by the mixed-race daughter of a slave owner in 1800s Alabama. Roberta was said to have fled her abusive home before turning to prostitution. She then moved on to the moonshine business where she used to sell this drink to her customers looking to drown their sorrows. What makes this so alcoholic . Gin: 40 per cent alcohol . Vodka: 40 per cent alcohol . Brandy: 40 per cent alcohol . Blackberry liquor: 40 per cent alcohol . Absinthe: 45 per cent alcohol . 5. Nicolashka . Typically an after-dinner drink, the Russian Nicolashka comprises a double shot of vodka, espresso powder, lemon and sugar. The concoction is consumed by first putting the lemon, sugar and coffee in the mouth, before taking one shot of vodka. The mixture is kept in the mouth and slowly chewed before being swallowed. The second shot of vodka comes swiftly after. It's a relatively simple drink but is strong, with drinkers claiming that keeping the alcohol in the mouth allows it to be absorbed faster into the blood stream. And while booze itself is said to slow the circulation, caffeine from the espresso, together with the vitamin C from the lemon, combine with the sugar to increase blood circulation, making the alcohol reach the brain swiftly. What makes this so alcoholic . Vodka: 40 per cent ABV . 6. Sazerac . There are various ways to make Sazerac but once again the best recipe is in the drink bible The Bartender’s Black Book. The recipe here calls for between two to four ounces of Peychaud’s Bitters and two ounces of rye whiskey, with one cube of sugar. But what elevates this cocktail is the coating of absinthe on the inside of the chilled glass, which adds extra potency to the drink. The higher the alcohol content of the whisky you use, the more lethal the drink becomes. What makes this so alcoholic . Rye whiskey: 80 per cent ABV . A Bone Dry Martini, also known as Pass the Bottle, is made with pure gin or vodka and no vermouth . 7. Caribou Lou . A surprisingly pleasant tasting drink made from 151 rum, pineapple juice and Malibu, this may not be the most alcoholic cocktail on the list but as it’s incredibly easy to drink, it makes it dangerous because you can put quite a few away without realising it. 151 rum has a high alcohol content which can sneak up on you when mixed with pineapple juice, rendering you drunk before you even know it.

"The mother of a New York City TV reporter blamed her sudden death at the age of 49 on her boss in a confrontation at the funeral, a new report has claimed. Lisa Colagrossi had just finished covering a house fire in the borough of Queens on March 19, when the married mother-of-two collapsed from a brain aneurysm and never regained consciousness. The reporter's mother Lois Colagrossi was greeting mourners at her funeral on March 23 when she was approached by her daughter's boss Camille Edwards. Witnesses who overheard the allegedly awkward interaction told the New York Post's Page Six that Mrs Colagrossi refused to hug Edwards and told her: 'You are the reason I am standing in this church'. Scroll down for video . Blame game: The mother of WABC reporter Lisa Colagrossi (left) has allegedly blamed her sudden death by a brain aneurysm to being overworked by boss Camille Edwards (right) Edwards went on to tell Mrs Colagrossi how hard of a worker her daughter was and how everyone at the station respected her. 'I am talking about how you worked my daughter to death,' Mrs Colagrossi responded. Sources told the newspaper that Edwards was then shuffled away. The paper reports that Edwards is feared at the station, where she has been nicknamed 'Camevil'. 'Camille is a bully and will target people she doesn't like, most often women. Lisa's colleagues applaud Lisa's mom for standing up to Camille,' a source told Page Six . Lisa Colagrossi, who lived with her husband and two sons in Stamford, Connecticut, would commute into the city each day as early as 2am and work through the afternoon.

However, the family has denied any grudge against either Edwards or the station where Colagrossi worked. 'We are extremely thankful and blessed by all the support from Camille and the entire ABC family. Lisa always chose to work the overnight shift because it allowed her to spend the most time with her family,' the family said in a statement. In a separate statement, WABC said: 'Camille is a tireless and compassionate champion for everyone who works here. Under her watch, we’re fortunate to have more women in leadership positions than ever before. Our thoughts and prayers are with Lisa’s family at this sad time.' Colagrossi started at the station in 2001, on the Sunday following the 9/11 attacks, and covered such high-profile stories as the Sandy Hook massacre. Colagrossi is a native of Ohio and had previously worked at stations in Alabama and West Virginia.

"A 26-year-old woman has been arrested for 'Facebook thugging' after posting a photo of herself pointing a gun on the social networking site in response to other users' 'misdirected threats'.

She then 'exchanged words' with the other users on the site, it is reported . After a user reported the picture to Henrico Police, Holmes, who lives in Chesterfield, Virginia, was arrested. She has since been charged with harassment by computer, according to WWBT. She is now facing a Class 1 misdemeanor that could result in one year in jail and a $2,500 fine. Speaking to the broadcaster, Holmes said she considered her charge 'ridiculous' - especially because she supposedly uploaded the photo in the context of a heated online argument. 'It wasn't a threat. I thought it was a funny picture, and then I realized later that it was a little bit intimidating. So I took it down,' she said, adding: 'What happened to freedom of speech?' Addressing other social media users, the animal-lover continued: 'Be careful what you put on the internet, because you can go to jail for it. Facebook thugging is a crime.'

"Confusion over Ukip’s immigration policy grew yesterday after Nigel Farage called for the number of arrivals into Britain to be limited at 50,000 a year. But at the same time he claimed that overall caps on net migration – as pledged by the Tories – would be ‘ludicrous’ because it was impossible to stop people leaving the country. Ukip’s manifesto chief later added to the confusion by saying the 50,000 limit ‘might change every year’. Confusion over Ukip’s immigration policy grew yesterday after Nigel Farage called for the number of arrivals into Britain to be limited at 50,000 a year . The Conservatives accused Mr Farage of ‘making up his policies as he goes along’ – but Mr Farage has denied his party has made any U-turns on immigration. Ukip first unveiled an immigration cap in February, with spokesman Stephen Woolfe saying the numbers being granted visas limited at 50,000. But at the start of March, Mr Farage overturned this by saying he would not set ‘arbitrary targets’. At the end of the month, the Ukip leader spoke of a net migration limit of ‘about 30,000 people a year’. Charlie Elphicke, the Tory candidate in Dover, said: ‘Ukip’s immigration policy doesn’t just change by the day, it changes by the minute in the space of one interview. It’s complete chaos. ‘The truth is with Nigel Farage, you just don’t know what you’re going to get. The only certainty is that a vote for Ukip lets Ed Miliband limp into Downing Street via the backdoor - and then there will be no action on immigration.’ Interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday, Mr Farage said about his party’s cap: ‘It’s below 50,000 a year, all right? It’s below 50,000 a year. Simple as that. The Conservatives accused Mr Farage of ‘making up his policies as he goes along’ – but Mr Farage has denied his party has made any U-turns on immigration . ‘But this whole debate we’ve been tied up with caps for five years. It’s devalued the debate. What we’re not actually addressing is the fact that 624,000 people settled in Britain last year and that we have no control over the numbers that settle this year or next year. ‘Let’s be honest, we cannot have any debate about immigration about numbers while we’re members of the European Union.’ Later in the day, Suzanne Evans, Ukip’s manifesto chief, said the level of the cap might change. She told the BBC News channel: ‘If we say, we have 21,000 highly skilled people coming from outside of the EU, where there is already a points based system, then we will talk to the businesses, that’s where we get our 50,000 limit from, but that might change every year.’","In February, Ukip unveiled 50,000 cap on those being given visas for UK .

"With two personal maids and travel by private jet, Choupette is by far the world's most pampered pet. And, it now appears the three-year-old cat belonging to Karl Lagerfeld is also the richest. The fashion designer has revealed his white Siamese earned £2.18million last year - that's just£220,000 less than Cara Delevingne, one of the world's top models, who took home £2.4million. Scroll down for video . Karl Lagerfeld, 82, with three-year-old Siamese Choupette, who has earned £2million from TV appearances . Last year Choupette earned nearly as much as Cara Delevingne, despite only doing two jobs . And while Choupette raked in his cash by appearing in just two adverts, Cara had to work a lot harder, starring in multiple campaigns, walking tens of catwalks (including Lagerfeld's Chanel shows) and endorsing products. Lagerfeld, 82, said his cat was picked to appear in a commercial for cars in Germany and beauty products in Japan. And while he was happy for her to star in the adverts for the luxury items, he said she was 'too sophisticated' to be used to advertise food for other cats. 'Choupette became the most famous cat in the world, and the richest,' said Lagerfeld, the head designer for fashion house Chanel. 'She did two jobs and made three million euros last year. One was for cars in Germany and the other was for a Japanese beauty product. Choupette in her Corsa car adverts for the new range in 2014 in Berlin. The cat has her own Twitter account . 'I don't allow her to do foodstuffs and things like this. She's too sophisticated for that. She had something unique' Choupette, who has her own Twitter and Instagram accounts, appeared in an advert for Opel cars helping to promote the new Corsa range in 2014. She followed in the footsteps of supermodels Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell who previously helped promote the cars. The cat has even been a cover girl for a magazine and recently, while staying in New York, had her own £400 a night room at the Mercer hotel . Lagerfeld shot the adverts for the Japanese company She Uemura with his pet becoming the first cat to front a beauty campaign. The German-born designer raised eyebrows two years ago when he said he was so in love with his feline friend that he wanted to marry her. He revealed the glamour puss ate dinner with him at a table in the Paris mansion they shared and had weekly manicures for her claws. Lagerfeld doted on Choupette so much he described her as a 'kept woman'. His affection for his furry friend hasn't waned. 'She stays always with me and she has two personal maids, he said. 'They play with her, they have to take care of her beautiful white hair, the beauty treatments for her eyes, and they entertain her. She is the centre of the world.' While in New York recently to present his latest collection Choupette had her own room at the £400 a night Mercer hotel. Lagerfeld said he has become a recluse, rarely going out because he doesn't want to be photographed by other people and end up in their 'selfies'. His pet cat is his only companion. 'She is like a human being, but the good thing is that she's silent,' he told New York magazine. 'You don't have to discuss it. She hates other animals and she hates children. She stays always with me and she has two personal maids. 'They play with her, they have to take care of her beautiful white hair, the beauty treatments for her eyes, and they entertain her. She is the centre of the world. Karl Lagerfeld at the opening of the exhibition of his photos 'Corsa Karl and Choupette' at the Palazzo Italia . The 82-year-old fashion designer raised eyebrows recently when he said he was so in love with his feline friend he wanted to marry her. He also revealed that she has weekly manicures for her claws . 'If you saw her, you would understand. She is kind of Greta Garbo. There is something unforgettable about her, the way she moves, the way she plays. 'She's an inspiration for elegance. For attitude.' Asked if having Choupette had changed him, Lagerfeld said:'Maybe I became a better person perhaps, I don't know. 'Less selfish, I guess? I think it's grotesque, but what can you do? I believe in the unique. This is not just something to keep me company. It's only great because of the uniqueness of her.' And Lagerfeld's own life is as gilded and bizarre as his cats. He has a butler who wears a white coat and tie and travels ahead of him, greeting him with a chilled wine glass of Diet Coke. In an interview with Harper's Bazaar he once revealed that he has to sleep for seven hours a day, every day. Lagerfeld stands next to a drawing of his Birman cat at the vernissage for his photo calender 'Corsa Karl and Choupette' at the Palazzo Italia in Berlin . Choupette even has her own Instagram which posts adorable pictures of the cat . He follows a strict diet which starts with two protein shakes and steamed apples and he refuses to drink hot drinks. Lagerfeld famously lost six and a half stone saying that he did so so that he could, 'be a good clothes horse.' His hair, which he has pulled back into a pony-tail every day, is not actually the white hue it seems, in fact he has previously admitted that he sprays it every day with masses of dry shampoo to achieve the colour.

Last year for his SS15 Womenswear show Karl used his models to create a feminist protest . When he's not designing he spends much of his time flying around the world in private jets, accompanied by gorgeous male models. He creates his famous designs at home and says he rarely likes to go out because he hates people taking pictures of him. He told TheCut: 'I don’t go to movie theaters because I don’t want to be photographed by strangers. 'People bother me wherever I go. I like to imagine the world my way. I don’t want second-rate images of the world.'","Three-year-old Choupette, the white Siamese cat, is 'richest cat in world'

But the party's surge in support was hit by a series of disastrous media appearances from the party's leader Natalie Bennett in which she struggled to explain her key policies. In February she suffered what she called a 'brain fade' on LBC Radio when she forgot the details of her party's key housing policies. Ms Bennett endured another tough interview yesterday - and was forced to defend her proposal to give every adult in Britain a guaranteed weekly income. She admitted the so-called 'citizens income' – which critics say would cost £280billion – would take longer than five years to bring in, and could take even longer. Ms Bennett also admitted that another Green pledge – to dismantle the Armed Forces and use weapons factories to build wind turbines – was also a 'long-term aspiration'.

"The National Football League has hired its first female ref, Sarah Thomas, according to a report. Thomas, 42, a referee for college football's Conference USA, has been considered before for a position in the NFL before she was chosen to start in the league next year, Baltimore reporter Aaron Wilson posted on his Twitter account. She has previously refereed preseasons games, scrimmages and minicamps after becoming part of the NFL's training program since 2013. Sarah Thomas, a 42-year-old mother of three from Brandon, Mississippi, has reportedly been tapped as the first woman to be hired as a full-time NFL referee. Above she officiates a preseason New Orleans Saints game . The Conference USA official became the first woman to officiate and FBS game in 2007 and the first to preside over a bowl game in 2009 . The NFL would not confirm Thomas's hiring on Friday, saying in a statement: 'The 2015 roster of officials has not yet been finalized. When it is, the new officials for 2015 and the entire roster will be announced.' Thomas will be among eight new hires made for the 2015 season, a source close to the matter told the LA Times. A Brandon, Mississippi, native, Thomas played basketball at University of Mobile before beginning officiating after attending a meeting with her brother. 'He told me there’s a bunch of old men sitting there. And that I might get some strange stares,' she told the Hattiesburg American last year. 'When I walked into that meeting sure enough that did happen.' She reffed basketball and high school football before moving on to college and becoming the first woman to officiate a FBS game in 2007 and the first to preside over a bowl game in 2009. 'The thing is, I've never set out to be the first and that hasn't changed, she said in 2013. 'I do this because I love it.' The mother of three credits her success in sports to being raised with brothers. The Mississippi native first began officiating after attending a meeting with her brother and credits her family with helping her succeed in the sports world . Though Thomas is tabbed to be the first full-time woman hire by the NFL, Shannon Eastin became the first female to officiate a game in the league when she was a replacement ref in 2012 . She also works as a  pharmaceutical sales representative, and says she doesn't wear the makeup she wears at her day job when she's on the gridiron,  according to Gulf Live. Shannon Eastin technically became the first woman to officiate an NFL game in 2012, when the league hired replacement refs while in negotiations with the officials' union. However, she stopped working for the NFL after owners reached an agreement with the regular officials. If Thomas begins reffing regular season games, the NFL would become the second major American sports league to have women officials, after the NBA. Violet Palmer and Dee Kanter were hired by the basketball league in 1997. Kantner was fired in 2002, though Palmer still regularly runs games in the playoffs. The NBA hired another female ref, Lauren Holtkamp, last year. Women umpires in baseball have only reached the Triple-A and preseason game levels. Female refs are common in the WNBA. Violet Palmer, NBA . Violet Palmer referees a game between the Orlando Magic and the Denver Nuggets in January of this year . Violet Palmer is the longest-serving female referee in any of American sport's four major leagues. She was first hired by the NBA in 1997 and has continued officiating men's basketball to the present day. Palmer later continued trailblazing, becoming the first woman to ref a playoff game in 2006, between the Indiana Pacers and the New Jersey Nets. Beyond breaking ground for her gender, she also publicly announced that she was lesbian in 2014, shortly after Jason Collins became the first NBA player to come out as gay. Dee Kantner, NBA . Dee Kanter, was hired the same year as Violet Palmer as an NBA ref but left after several seasons. Above, Kantner stands next to North Carolina Tar Heels coach Sylvia Hatchell at a 2013 womens's NCAA game . Dee Kantner joined the NBA officiating staff the same year as Palmer, but was fired after the 2001-2002 season. In a statement about her firing, the league said that she was 'not making sufficient progress in her own development'. Kantner said that she was 'stunned' by her letting go and that she had been given no warning about the decision. She worked as the supervisor of officials in the WNBA before going to the men's league, a role to which she has since returned. The long time referee has also consistently officiated women's college basketball. Lauren Holtkamp, NBA . Female NBA ref Laura Holtkamp, who  is completing her first season in the NBA this year, discusses a call with Denver Nuggets player Ty Lawson in November . Laura Holtkamp, 34, became the NBA's third female referee in 2014 after . She played basketball at Drury University in Missouri and had plans to get a master's degree in divinity at Emory in Atlanta before being drawn to refereeing. She soon became reffing women's college games as well as WNBA and NBA D-League matches, according to Grantland. Her first year in the league has not been without controversy. Los Angeles Clippers point guard Chris Paul was criticized by many for alleged sexism when he said 'this might not be for her,' after he was given a technical fowl by Holtkamp. Pamela Postema, MLB Spring Training . Female MLB umpire Pamela Postema calls balls and strikes behind the plate at a a Kansas City Royals game in 1992 . Pamela Postema was not the first woman to umpire a professional baseball game, with her first innings come five years after Bernice Gera sued Major League Baseball to preside over a minor league contest in 1972. However, Postema became a fixture in the professional games everywhere but 'The Show' in the 1980s. She spent seven years in Triple-A, the league directly below the majors, and even made it to spring training games in 1988 and 1989. However, she was controversially fired in 1989 after the death of MLB commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti, who had been considered supportive of her career. Postema filed a sex discrimination lawsuit after the firing ended her well-regarded career, which was settled out of court. Ria Cortesio, Minor League Baseball . Ria Cortesio, pictured at a Double-A game between the Jacksonville Suns and the Montgomery Biscuits in 2007, was fired the same year . Ria Cortesio was the face of female umpiring in baseball for many years in the mid-2000s. She spent nine years in the minor leagues, with the highest being the Double-A Southern League, according to the Houston Chronicle. Cortesio was also the first woman since Postema to umpire an exhibition game when she worked a spring training match-up between the Chicago Cubs and Arizona Diamondbacks. She also worked the Home Run Derby at the 2006 All-Star Game in Pittsburgh. Her umpire rating in Double-A slipped during the 2007 season and she was let go in the autumn of that year, according to ESPN. Shannon Eastin . Shannon Eastin became the first woman to officiate a regular season NFL game in 2012. Above, she follows the Jacksonville Jaguars and Indianapolis Colts during the same month . Shannon Eastin became the first woman to officiate a regular season NFL game in 2012 when she was used as a replacement ref in the September 2012 game between the St Louis Rams and the Detroit Lions. Regular officials were locked out by owners during a 2012 dispute, a replacement refs were used until an agreement was reached at the end of September. She had previously officiated the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference college games and high school games before being hired by the NFL.

"He's part of one of the most famous, most watched, most talked-about families on the planet. But over the last year, Rob Kardashian - brother to Kim, Kourtney and Khloe - has all but disappeared from the media spotlight. And now in newly released clips from this week's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians his family have once again expressed their concern for the once gregarious but now reclusive 28-year-old. Scroll down for video . Rob Kardashian is rarely seen out and about and is thought to have struggled with his weight gain over the recent years . For it's been nearly a year since Rob seemed to vanish from the public eye. A former fixture on red carpets and social media, he now rarely tweets, his Instagram contains just one post and he is rarely pictured outside his house. It's a far cry from the fun loving Rob we were once used to seeing on our screens, when in the early series of KUWTK he would spend his days partying and larking about with his sisters. Confident and good looking Rob was even filmed trying out to be a model having been encouraged to do so by Kim. In 2008 he even took a spin on Dancing With The Stars - the popular US dancing equivalent to Strictly Come Dancing. But now multiple sources say that Rob is in a 'dark place,' and his sister Khloe has previously revealed that she believes her brother suffers from social anxiety. Rob was previously a regular at red carpet events, he is pictured here with Kim at the opening of the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel Casion in 2009 . Radar Online recently reported that Rob terrified his family last weekend when he didn't contact them for three days, bringing them close to calling the police. And there has long been speculation that Rob has long been tortured by his fame and uncomfortable with his family's increasing notoriety. Some point to December 2012, when his relationship with Rita Ora broke down, as the moment in which the cracks began to show. He took to Twitter to lambaste the singer accusing her of cheating on him. In tweets that he later deleted Rob said: 'She cheated on me with nearly 20 dudes while we were together... But I mean 20?!!!!' He later added: 'How can a woman who is so busy trying to start her own career have time to be with so many dudes while in a relationship?!' In happier days Rob posed with his sisters Kim, Kourtney and Khloe at a club in Las Vegas . Rob, pictured here with his whole family in 2011, used to be happy to be part of the Keeping Up With The Kardashians, however, he is no longer on the show . Rita responded to the tweets  saying: 'When you are involved with someone for a while and they decide to express their feelings to the public, well, that's not my personal way of therapy but I guess everyone takes split-ups differently… . 'You should have to sit an exam before you go on Twitter. To see if you're mentally stable.' She also said that she had never thought of their relationship as a serious boyfriend/girlfriend commitment. Rob cut a slim figure in 2012 but has since piled on the pounds, something he is said to have struggled with . Then last year Rob shocked onlookers when he decided to pull out of his own sister's wedding. When Kim married Kanye West in Italy last summer Rob was notably absent. Despite having traveled with his family to Europe he turned around at the last minute and went home. Kim has since revealed that he only told her of his decision on the morning of her big day. She said: 'He sent me a long email the morning of (the wedding), that he was going to leave. She added, 'I just thought, ""You know what, this is my day. I'm not even going to worry about it"".' It has been widely speculated that Rob's current lack of confidence comes from his weight and that he didn't attend the nuptials because he was worried about being photographed. Over the last few years the star has piled on the pounds and in episodes of KUWTK filmed before he departed from the show he was often heard talking about his weight. Rob shocked his Instagram followers when he posted this picture of Amy Adams character from Gone Girl saying that it was his sister Kim . On several occasions he went on diets and his sisters tried to help him lose the pounds and stay away from his beloved fast food, but nothing seemed to work. And whilst the man himself is yet to comment on his disappearance, his family have been quite vocal about his issues. His elder sister Khloe has previously revealed that she believes that Rob suffers from social anxiety. She said: 'I just feel, especially over the last year, Rob has become very introverted and has a kind of social anxiety. 'He's definitely not at his happiest place that he once was, and I know he can get to that happy place and he will. 'We all kind of get to a place where you don't know where to go in life or whatever, so I think it's important for him to know that he always has people to lean on and it's not unnatural for people to not know where to begin. It's a growing process. 'I will always be his number one supporter.' In a new episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians Rob's Mother Kris (left) and his sister Kim (right) are seen arguing about how best to handle him . Rob was a popular member of the KUWTK cast but he is now rarely seen on the show . In clips from this week's show the family are once again seen discussing how best to help him. In one clip Kris says that the family has 'all the resources in the world,' to help her son. However, Kim is less kind, butting into the conversation and telling her mum and Khloe: 'Now what we have to do is everyone back off.' She continues: 'Everyone licks Rob's ass and does everything he says and it's just at some point you have to give it up. 'We all make his life so easy: ""Okay we'll drive you around with a chauffeur so no one has to look at you."" We had a chef on standby, a trainer, we'll send people to run out and buy you socks and underwear. 'Like this is pathetic. We're not going to cater to him any more but it has to be all of us.' Kris suggests 'maybe he can't help himself,' but Kim quickly replies: 'No he is still competent to where he can ask for help when he needs it.' Rob poses with his sister Kourtney (left) and his Mum and sister Kim (right) Rob cut a lonely figure when he was spotted at his Malibu home . Although neither of them have commented on it it seems things have been rather frosty between Kim and Rob of late. Rob recently raised eyebrows when he posted a picture of Amy Adams character in Gone Girl to his Instagram with the cryptic caption: 'This is my sister kim , the b**** from Gone Girl...' In a further clip from the hit reality TV show Kris told Khloe how she would like to help her troubled son. The matriarch said: 'I'm really, really, really worried about Rob. 'I talked to this guy that came highly recommended and he seems to think that everything I described about Rob is textbook and that he could come with all the proper people and help him but do it at home.' However the youngest Kardashian sibling still lives with Khloe, who  expressed her reservations. She said: 'So now you guys want to now have an outsider come in and ambush Rob  and basically ambush me. 'Neither you, nor Kourtney, nor Kim have even like attempted to see him for numerous days in a row. Do you even know his daily routines? Anything? No because you guys aren't there.' However, in a final clip released from the show it seems Khloe is as desperate as her mother to get him some help. The 30-year-old is seen taking a break from a hike to call her brother. Although Rob's side of the conversation can not be heard it is clear that it is causing Khloe some distress as she starts crying. 'You leave every facility that we take you to,' she is seen telling him on a phone call. And at the end of the call she exclaims: 'Just accept the f***ing help!'","Rob Kardashian, 28, has taken disappeared from the media spotlight .

"A judge has dismissed stalking and harassment charges filed against an ice cream truck operator who had been accused of trying to run his rival, Mr. Ding-A-Ling, out of their small New York town in a local turf war. Prosecutors in Fulton County say a judge in Gloversville dismissed the charges against Joshua Malatino this week. Malatino and his then-girlfriend, Samantha Scott  of the Snow Kone Joe ice cream truck business were charged in April 2013 after the driver of a Mr. Ding-a-Ling truck said the two had repeatedly harassed and stalked him. Scroll down for video . Exonerated: A judge has dismissed stalking and harassment charges filed against Joshua Malatino, seen here with and Amanda Scott in June 2013, after a driver of a rival truck claimed they tried to put him out of business . Cold war: Malatino allegedly offered his rival's customers free ice cream and boasted that he 'owned the town's ice cream truck business in Gloversville' The resolution to the case marks two years of bitter legal battles between Malatino, Scott and Phillip Hollister, of Mr. Ding-A-Ling, who the pair were accused of stalking. Indeed, when the fractious dispute first came to national attention in 2013, Scott and Malatino were accused of chasing Hollister's truck and playing loud music to disrupt his customers. Hollister and Mr. Ding-A-Ling said that Malatino would shout, 'You don't have a chance, this is my town', while he angrily followed the rival ice cream truck. On another occasion, Hollister said that Malatino pulled up behind his truck and offered free ice cream to undercut him. Embarrassing: The couple were arrested in April 2013 and accused of harassing and stalking another ice cream vendor in the small town in upstate New York . Fine: Scott's separate case resulted in her accepting a fine for disorderly conduct. She is no longer with Malatino . Testing times: Amanda Scott was reported to be a co-owner in Snow Kone Joe ice cream truck business in Gloversville . Moving on: Samantha Scott is no longer with Malatino and it is not known if she lives in Gloversville anymore . Hollister made complaints to police in Gloversville and they warned Scott and Malatino to cease their aggressive actions. The one-time lovers were  arrested and charged with harassment and stalking and the town refused to renew his license to sell ice cream. However, ultimately the case was thrown out. The judge in the case said that offering free ice cream was not illegal and their meetings were always accidental. Malatino told the Times Union he never doubted his name would be cleared. 'I'm happy it's over and the decision came down in my favor. I think it was ridiculous from day one and felt it was a personal attack against me,' said Malatino. 'My name has been tarnished across the world because this was all over the Internet, and it affected my daughter and my family,' said Malatino. Scott pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was given a fine. Authorities said the incidents did not meet the legal definitions of harassment .","Judge dismissed charges of harassment and stalking against owner of small-town ice cream truck business .

"A mother accused of smothering her infant son inside a bathroom at a busy Midtown Manhattan restaurant reportedly told police she put the boy 'to sleep' to spare him from being eaten by someone. Latisha Fisher, 35, has been charged with second-degree murder for allegedly killing 20-month-old Gavriel Ortiz-Fisher with her bare hands inside a restroom at 5 Boro Burger on West 36th Street Monday afternoon. Fisher had a violent past and a history of psychiatric problems, but she was evaluated as mentally fit as recently as last year. Scroll down for video . Latisha Fisher (left) was arrested Monday after allegedly smothering her 20-month-old son Gavriel Ortiz to death in a bathroom at a Manhattan restaurant. She told police she was afraid someone was going to eat her son . The 35-year-old mother allegedly locked herself in the bathroom of 5 Boro Burger  in Midtown where she was later found holding her unconscious baby boy. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia after a 2011 stabbing . Following her arrest for the murder of her baby son, the 35-year-old mother allegedly told police: 'I was afraid that someone was going to eat him so I was protecting him. I put him to sleep with my hand,' reported the New York Post. Recently uncovered records show that Fisher was recommended for an alternative sentencing program after pleading guilty for the 2011 stabbing of her aunt. She received a positive evaluation as recently as September, according to documents seen by the New York Daily News . Fisher was sentenced to probation under the Center for Alternative Sentencing and Employment Services program after Tasering her aunt and stabbing her in the head, arm and ear. She had been taking medication to combat her paranoid schizophrenia after being diagnosed in the aftermath of the incident, according to the New York Times. The woman told clinicians that she had heard voices saying that her aunt was trying to kill her before the stabbing. In September a court-appointed social worker said that she was 'a poster child for an alternative to incarceration program' and had 'adjusted very well to the demands of new motherhood'. The report followed a July psychiatric evaluation where she was found 'stable and capable of remaining in the community'. As Latisha Fisher was being led away from the 5 Boro Burger on Monday, she blamed the devil for killing Gavriel Ortiz and then trying to stop workers who attempted to resuscitate him. She was charged with second-degree murder on Tuesday. Witnesses said Fisher was emotionless after the death of her child. 'I would describe her as soulless. She put her hand over his mouth and smothered him,' a police source said. A woman who walked into the bathroom Monday afternoon says she saw Fisher with her hand over the baby's mouth, saying she was trying to 'make him go to sleep'. Above, investigators inside the restaurant on Monday . Baby Gavriel was found unconscious and foaming from the mouth when restaurant workers broke into the bathroom . She claimed that she had put her hand over the boy's nose and mouth to put him to sleep, police say. Workers at the restaurant became alarmed Monday afternoon when a line grew outside the restroom. When employees burst in to see what was wrong, they found Gavriel in his mother's lap - unconscious and foaming from the mouth. A male employee performed CPR until paramedics arrived - despite the mother swatting help away. Unfortunately the aid was too late for the little boy who was later pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital. Police immediately took Fisher into custody and transported her to the Midtown South Precinct. Marcus Comeau told amNY that he was standing down the block when he saw Fisher being led out of the restaurant by police. 'The mother was coming out in handcuffs,' he said. 'She didn't seem too distressed, kind of had her head down.' Recent posts on her Facebook page appear to show her going through an emotional period. 'How did everything change on me. I went to sleep feeling well,' she wrote on March 27, one day after posting a thank you to 'everyone for supporting me'. 'With her attitude and her past, any little thing could have set her off,' Fisher's friend Brian Rivera told the New York Times. 'She’s good and kind until that button gets switched. I don’t know why they ever let her out again' Gavriel was rushed to Bellevue Hospital but doctors could not revive the young boy. Neighbors say that Fisher's older son, who has autism, was also mistreated . Neighbor's in Fisher's (left) Lower East Side apartment say she lived there with her boyfriend and father of her son Luis Ortiz (father and son pictured on the right) She had reportedly poured burning oil onto a former partner’s head and previously tried to kill herself. Neighbors in the Lower East Side housing project where she lives said that she and her boyfriend, Gavriel's father Luis Ortiz, had started fighting around Halloween. Other neighbors told the Daily News that she was 'violent' and that they could often smell marijuana coming from her unit. Fisher spent most of her youth in group homes after setting fire to her crack-addicted mother's sleeping boyfriend as a child. A relative said that the child welfare agency had been told about Fisher's mistreatment of her own older son, who has autism, but a complaint was dismissed because of lack of evidence. She met up with her current boyfriend, Ortiz, in 2013 and had stopped drinking, only showing care for her new baby. However, after her apparent recovery, she had recently shown signs of strange behavior. Mr Rivera told the New York Times that he saw her in her room with candles and a book on witchcraft opened tot a section on 'sacrifice' around October last year. She had also been meeting with a man known to sell drugs. 'She needs help. It doesn’t make sense. I think she was on medication for whatever problem she had, but I’m assuming she wasn’t taking her meds,' a neighbor said. Following Monday's incident, family and friends started pouring out condolences on Luis Ortiz's Facebook page.","Latisha Fisher, 35, allegedly locked herself in a bathroom at 5 Boro Burger in Midtown Manhattan Monday afternoon with son Gavriel Ortiz .

"The girlfriend of killer co-pilot Andreas Lubtiz is believed to be too scared to return to the small town they both grew up in fearing the she will face the ‘hatred of the world’. Kathrin Goldbach and her family are said to be so afraid of being blamed for the Germanwings crash - caused by Lubitz after he flew the plane he was co-piloting into the French Alps – that they have fled the town and vowed to never return. The 26-year-old maths teacher, her rescue volunteer brother Andreas and their parents told friends they do not plan to return to their home in the centre of the close-knit rural community of Montabaur. Scroll down for video . Kathrin Goldbach, the girlfriend of killer pilot Andreas Lubitz, and her family, including her brother Andreas (pictured left and right), have reportedly fled their home in Montabaur and have no plans to return . A friend of the distraught family said: ‘The girlfriend of the co-pilot has nothing to do with what happened. ‘But the hatred of the world is coming down upon her, and you know this place is so small, it is very hard for them to come back here. ‘They would have to look to find somewhere to stay around here if they wanted to get away. It is just not possible for them to keep a low profile so they are not coming back. ‘It is so much easier if you live in Dusseldorf or somewhere like that. ‘But for the parents to come back here, it was almost impossible for them, it is just too small a town.’ An extremely shaken Miss Goldbach, who is seeking comfort from a priest, told investigators that her long-term boyfriend Lubtiz had whisked her away on holiday just days before his death.

An extremely shaken Miss Goldbach, who is seeking comfort from a priest, told investigators that her long-term boyfriend Lubtiz had whisked her away on holiday just days before his death . Family members were also said to have joined the couple – who first met while working in a local Burger King as teenagers - on the final holiday. Miss Goldbach left her teaching job in Montabaur after Lubitz qualified as a pilot in 2013 and the pair moved to a flat in Dusseldorf. She got a job in a secondary school in a town called Krefeld just outside of the city. The young teacher also confirmed that in the weeks before the crash he had bought ‘his and her’ luxury Audi’s for himself and Miss Goldbach. Yesterday, it was claimed that footage showing the last few seconds inside the doomed flight had been found among the wreckage of the crash site . French prosecutor Brice Robin has called for anyone with footage of the plane crash which killed 150 people to hand it over to the authorities . A source close to the investigation said: ‘His girlfriend was very nervous in the interview. She had a female minister with her to try to keep her calm but she was wringing her hands and was very tense. ‘She knew he was ill but had no idea he was in this state of mind. He showed no signs of suicidal thoughts.’ Yesterday French prosecutor Brice Robin called for anyone with footage of the plane crash which killed 150 people to hand it over to the authorities. The demand came after German and French media reported having seen a video recording showing the final chaotic scenes of the flight as it hurled towards the Alps mountainside.

"A 12-year-old boy has set a world record after discovering the largest European wasp nest on a property Down Under. Jordan Waddingham scoured through bushland at Karoola, north east of Launceston in Tasmania to unravel  the plague of wasps after his mother Stephanie offered him $20 to locate the nest. Within minutes, the little wasp hunter made a startling discovery when he stumbled across the gigantic two-year-old nest near a creek bank after following a trail of wasps. Scroll down for video . Jordan Waddingham made a startling discovery after finding the world's largest European wasp nest . 'I followed the wasps back to their nest after they'd gone and collected wood from our sheds,' young Jordan told Seven News. Honorary Research Associate at Launceston's Queen Victoria Museum Simon Fearn told ABC it took two days to unearth the nest from the ground and four men to carry it out of the bush. 'A one-year-old nest is the size of a soccer ball, but this nest takes up the best part of a cubic metre,' he said. 'Normally European wasp nests don't survive through winter, but last year's mild, dry winter allowed it to survive into its second year.' The 12-year-old said he followed a trail of wasps when he stumbled across the gigantic 90-kilogram nest . Young Jordan's discovery is currently on display at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery in Launceston . The 90-kilogram nest is measured at one metre tall and a circumference of three metres after it was located among a blueberry bush and destroyed overnight when the wasps were dormant. Experts believe it's the largest subterranean European wasp nest ever discovered with up to 100,000 wasps could have been living inside, Seven News reports. The nest will be on display at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery  in Launceston over the Easter long weekend.","A 12-year-old boy found the world's largest European wasp nest ever found .

"When Dr Michael Shannon saved Chris Trokey's life when he was born premature more than 30 years ago, he could never have known that the favor would one day be returned. But in 2011, Dr Shannon was trapped in his burning SUV after it was T-boned by a semi-truck, when Trokey, now an Orange County Fire Authority paramedic, worked to pull him out alive. Their incredible story was shared by KTLA after the pair both participated in a fundraiser for childhood cancer in Rancho Santa Margarita, California on Sunday. Reunited: Chris Trokey, second left, saved the life of Dr Michael Shannon, pictured center, with fellow paramedics (pictured) in 2011 - thirty years after the doctor saved his life as a newborn . The two men greeted each other like old friends before having their heads shaved for The St. Baldrick's Foundation. They recalled how, exactly four years prior, Dr Shannon had been driving on Pacific Coast Highway in Dana Point  when he was hit by a truck and pinned beneath it in his vehicle. Firefighters from Paramedic Engine 29 - of which Trokey was a part - responded to the fire and managed to stop the flames and cut him out of the car. But Trokey was unaware of who he had saved until he went to the hospital, where Dr Shannon spent more than a month recuperating. 'I was like, ""Oh my gosh, Dr. Shannon?""' Trokey told KTLA.

They had met many years before - when Trokey was born weighing just 3.2 pounds and his pediatrician - Dr. Shannon - stayed with the baby around the clock to make sure he survived. 'It's amazing to watch them all grow up, but to have one come back in your life, on a day you really need it, that's really incredible,' Shannon said. He added to Yahoo: 'I do believe that things are supposed to happen when they do. I see examples of this almost daily in my life and practice.'

"Police have arrested and charged a man and woman over the discovery of a mass greyhound dog grave in Queensland. A 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were both charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg on Thursday. The carcasses of more than 50 greyhounds were found at the bush site in Coonarr, near Bundaberg, on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Police have charged a man and woman over the discovery of a mass greyhound dog grave in Bundaberg . A 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were both charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg, Queensland, on Thursday . A Queensland Police and RSPCA taskforce, set up after the greyhound racing industry was rocked by the live baiting scandal in February, also found ammunition shells from a .22 calibre gun. The pair, both from Bundaberg, will appear in the Bundaberg Magistrates Court on Friday. RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says it's understood the dogs were killed before a Four Corners special which exposed the horrors of the greyhound racing industry. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' Beatty told Fairfax media. The carcasses of more than 50 greyhounds were found at the bush site in Coonarr on Tuesday . At least 55 carcasses were found in the Coonarr area, near Bundaberg, on Tuesday, with the RSPCA. Early investigations suggest the dogs were young dogs that were killed as they were too slow . 'Unfortunately as I think most people would be aware, there's always been a lot of wastage in the greyhound industry.' Police said it was unclear how long the dogs' bodies had been there, but confirmed they were found in various states of decomposition. There were no greyhound training facilities or other connections to the racing industry in the area, a police spokesperson said. Queensland Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller expressed her outrage on Twitter after the discovery. 'Absolutely sickened that @QPSmedia and @RSPCAQLD have found the remains of 55 greyhounds. Animal cruelty in Qld won't be tolerated,' she wrote. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' an RSPCA spokesperson told Fairfax media . There were no greyhound training facilities or other connections to the racing industry in the area, a police spokesperson said . The taskforce was established to investigate the use of live baiting using possums, rabbits and piglets to train competitive greyhounds. It came after an ABC Four Corners expose from earlier this year sparked widespread outrage after showing racing dogs chasing and mauling live animals. So far, five people have been charged with a total of 23 offences in the state. An independent review headed up by barrister Alan MacSporran SC is also being conducted into the practice. It's expected to be completed in about three months' time. This review aims to find out how widespread the use of live baiting is in Queensland, and how it could go undetected for so long.

"Blindness didn't stop one New Hampshire man from taking on the Tough Mudder last week, where he was one of only 10 percent of competitors to successfully ring a bell while swinging on a rope 25 feet in the air. Randy Pierce, from Nashua, may now gearing up to run the Boston Marathon this month, but there was once a time he couldn't walk at all. Pierce lost his sight when he was just 22 years old, from a neurological disease that also left him in a wheelchair. Randy Pierce, pictured at the Boston 5K with his late dog Quinn, was one of only 10 percent of competitors to successfully complete the Tough Mudder's 'King of the Swingers' obstacle in California last week . Pierce had to jump off a ledge and grab a piece of rope that he needed to swing to a bell 25 feet above the air, before falling into a pit of muddy water . And although he was 'frustrated and angry' at first, Pierce was soon  training himself to walk again. 'I love turning obstacles into opportunity,' he told My Fox Boston. 'How much do you have to rebound from, how much do you have to climb up from? The the answer is, however much is there to be climbed.' Pierce left his wheelchair for good in 2006 and was soon climbing plenty - all 48 mountains in New Hampshire, to be exact. And he was running again too, participating in 30 road races with his guide dog Quinn. 'When you can't walk, you learn what a gift it is to celebrate walking, climbing, running, whatever it is,' he said. And Pierce is now a viral star after his incredible performance at a Tough Mudder competition in California last week, where a video captured him completing the 'King of the Swingers' obstacle. Pierce left his wheelchair for good in 2006. He has since climbed all 48 mountains in New Hampshire, as well as run 30 road races, with his guide dog Quinn . Pierce decided to run the 2015 Boston Marathon in honor of Quinn after the dog passed away from bone cancer last year . The challenge, just one of many in the team-oriented 10-12 mile obstacle course, required Pierce to jump off a ledge and grab on to a rope, according to the Tough Mudder's website. As Pierce swung through the air, he successfully hit the bell each participant must try and ring, before falling 25 feet into a pit of muddy water. 'My fingers just grazed the bell but it started ringing and tipping and the crowd went crazy,' he told My Fox Boston. Now Pierce is hoping to hear he will hear the crowd cheer at the end of the Boston Marathon finish line, a race he is running in memory of Quinn, who passed away from bone cancer last year. It was Quinn who helped Pierce cross the finish line at Boston's shorter 5K run just a day before the bombings in 2013. And it is Quinn who will be on Pierce's mind as he runs the April 20 race. 'I'm going to savor all these people running with me, all these people lining the streets,' he told WMUR 9. 'And I'm going to savor one really mighty guide dog.' Pierce has run three marathons just this year in preparation for the Boston Marathon on April 20 .","Randy Pierce was one of only 10 percent of competitors to successfully leap off a ledge, grab onto a rope and ring a bell while 25 feet in the air .

"Screeching around the track in a car he last drove more than 50 years ago, Sir Stirling Moss appears to have lost none of his racing pedigree. And at 85, the man widely seen as history's greatest all-round racer has revealed the unusual daily routine he thanks for his impressive longevity – 77 press-ups and half a bottle of Chardonnay. Sir Stirling, who won 212 races in his 14-year career, also spoke about how he has swapped the high-octane vehicles of his heyday for a tiny electric car that has a top speed of just 50mph. Reunited: Sir Stirling Moss sitting behind the wheel of the refurbished Austin-Healey Sprite . Success: The 85-year-old won 212 races during his 14-year career before a crash at Goodwood in 1962 . Back in action: Sir Stirling examines the refurbished car alongside Car SOS presenter Fuzz Townshend . Speaking to The Daily Mail, Sir Stirling said he sees fitness as a 'way of life' which is why he is still so confident behind the wheel. However, never one for strenuous gym sessions, he puts his health down to more unusual methods. He said: 'I have half a bottle of wine a day, which fits in very nicely, and that's it. I do what I call lady press ups and I do 77 a day. 'It's not as difficult as it sounds because I do them from a kneeling position. I could not do 70 press ups like I could when I was 30 years old. 'I've broken various bones during my career so I'm not that flexible. I think staying fit is a way of life more than anything else really.' When it comes to diet, he said he believes in indulgence and never denies himself something he wants. He said: 'I never go to bed hungry, let's put it that way, especially as Susie is such a fantastic cook. Car SOS sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. Above, Sir Stirling with presenters Fuzz Townshend and Tim Shaw . Sir Stirling drove the refurbished car in 1962 - one month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career (pictured above). He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks . 'I allow myself whatever I want but I would have to say my indulgences are that Susie and I drink one bottle of wine each day, white certainly, Chardonnay. And chocolate. I'm trying to cut that down but not that successfully.' He made the revelations after a new documentary reunited the father-of-two with the Austin-Healey Sprite he used as a training car before the 1962 Sebring three-hour race. The race took place a month before the crash at Goodwood on Easter Monday that ended his career. He had to be cut out of his Lotus and was unconscious for six weeks. He returned to the cockpit a year later but decided against competing professionally as he felt he was no longer driving instinctively. The Austin-Healey Sprite was also used by the rest of his team, including Hollywood star Steve McQueen and racing legends Innes Ireland and Pedro Rodriguez. Car SOS, which broadcasts on the National Geographic Channel on Thursday, sees the rusty Sprite rescued from a suburban garage and carefully renovated before Sir Stirling puts it through its paces once again. While he found fame hurtling around corners at death-defying speeds, Sir Stirling now takes a more measured approach to the road. For the last 18 months he has been driving a Renault Twizy, an electric car with a top speed of 50mph. He said of the car, which retails for less than £7,000: 'I live right in the middle of London, right by Hyde Park Corner, and the limitations on an electric car like that, you don't notice them. 'If I lived outside the North Circular there might be times when I'd think ""Crickey, I wonder if I'll make it back on the charge"" but having said that, the Twizy is just the sort of car to have around London. Sir Stirling has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. Above, the couple at Silverstone in July 2011 . 'It is absolutely very different to the cars I used to drive. There are certainly good reasons to have a petrol car but living where I do, in the centre of London, I can't think of anything better than what I have got.' Sir Stirling, who was knighted in 2000, said he would not want to be a professional driver today because he thinks there are too few races. He said: 'It's quite different now though, they only do 18 races a year, I was doing 52 because I would go down to Australasia in the winter or Malaysia or South Africa and do all types of racing. ' It's so different now that you can't compare the life of a driver then and now. It's unfortunately one of those things that has moved on and I don't think will ever be able to move back.' He has been married to his third wife, Lady Susan Moss, 62, since 1980 and said the secret to his matrimonial bliss is that he 'married the perfect girl'. He added: 'If your wife is your best friend that's the important thing to me. If every decision you think about or make or take you discuss with her first, I think that's very important. 'But then Susie says I do what I want anyway.'

"A woman who bought cheap hair extensions in a bid to look glamorous ended up with an infection and a hole in her head. Tina Campbell, from London, paid £100 for the weave but was forced to seek urgent medical attention after her scalp became infected. However, Tina, who spent the day of her 29th birthday in bandages, said the incident has not deterred her from hair hair extensions again. Scroll down for video . Tina Campbell paid £100 for hair extensions - and was left with a hole in her head . A close up of one of the boils which developed on her scalp . Miss Campbell, who works as a showbiz writer, said: 'Everyone wants luxurious locks like Kim Kardashian and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, but what if you could get them at a fraction of the cost?' said Miss Campbell. 'That was the proposition when I met up with a friend who suddenly had the most amazing, long, flowing blonde hair. 'She told me it’s a weave and she got it done at an African hair shop. 'I asked whether it was just for Afro hair but she said it was fine, adding that they would put my hair into cornrows and then sew the extensions in. Tina Campbell looks glamorous with her new glossy hair extensions . A few weeks after having the weave, she developed painful boils . 'I couldn’t believe it when she told me the cheap price – it was £45 for a full head, while some salons charge hundreds, or even thousands. 'Having struggled to grow my own hair and often experimenting with clip-ins, I soon found myself getting it done too. 'Being able to go to bed with perfect hair and wake up with it was a revelation. People would always comment on how nice it looked and I was hooked.' Miss Campbell said that after the extensions had gone their course, instead of going back to the same place that she had them done before, she decided to save time and go somewhere closer to home. Tina spent her 29th birthday in bandages after her hair extension nightmare (left and right) 'The stylist at the salon in Welling, South East London, did not fill me with confidence,' she said. 'She was vague when discussing the price, and simply waved me to sit down so she could start there and then. I could see the needles sitting on the side in blue antiseptic liquid. 'I didn’t have a great feeling about the place but I wanted them done for an event that night so I bit the bullet. 'They ended up charging me £100 – way more than last time.' However, Miss Campbell said that a few weeks after having them put in, her scalp started to itch unbearably and she started to notice small lumps forming. 'Concerned, I took them out, but the lumps – one on top of my head and a cluster lower down towards my neck – seemed to grow and harden,' she said. 'The doctor said they were boils, which I’d never had before, and said to bathe them.' Instead of looking pretty on her 29th birthday, Tina spent the day in bandages after having the boils surgically removed . Miss Campbell said that days later, pus began oozing from the one on top of her head, which although looked disgusting, seemed to ease it. 'Not so for the others though,' she added. 'They were fusing together and causing the area to swell. The pain was excruciating and I’d stay up with my head in my hands, willing it to stop. 'Then, the night before my birthday, the lumps burst and thick red, lumpy liquid seeped out that burned as it touched the raw skin. 'Less than 24 hours later, I was lying on a hospital bed having a section of my head shaved. 'Fully awake and shaking with fear, I gritted my teeth as a doctor cut a hole into my skull to drain the infection. 'Despite having had nine needles injected into my head to try and numb the area, I could still feel it and the sound of scalpel on bone was like something from a horror movie. 'I told the doctor to shave it all off, but thankfully it didn’t come to that. 'I had to wear the bandage on my head for three weeks afterwards, making out-patient visits to have the hole in my head filled with a special material and the dressing replaced. Looking good: Tina, pictured on the red carpet while covering the Oscars, says despite her experiences, she has not been put off having hair extensions . 'The medical opinion was that the cause had been a dirty needle used to sew the extensions in. My doctor said that it could have nicked my scalp as the hair was attached to the cornrows.' Miss Campbell said that when confronted, the salon owner was adamant it was the hair itself that was the cause, and as the customer had provided it, was not down to her. 'Shortly afterwards, the salon changed its name and has since closed down,' added Miss Campbell. 'Since then, I’ve sporadically had similar abscesses develop on other parts of my body, including one which had to be cut out of my lower spine. It’s horrid as aside from painful, they leave scars. 'Doctors as yet are unable to find a cause and keep advising me get tested for diabetes every few months. 'Research online shows that my case is not an isolated incident. 'While one pointed the finger at extensions made from real human hair, I disagree as mine were synthetic.' Despite her grim experience, Miss Campbell said the experience has not put her off. 'Call me crazy, but after leaving it a while, I gradually began to experiment with extensions again,' she said. 'It’s a confidence thing I guess, especially when on a red carpet waiting to interview people who constantly have their hair coiffed to perfection. 'I’ve worn wigs in the past, but prefer extensions which give you so much more freedom. 'Ultimately, I think that the key is to just know who is doing your hair and if you get a bad feeling, no matter what the bargain, don’t take the risk. It's not worth it.'","Tina Campbell paid £100 for a weave at a salon  in London .

"Almost 20,000 years ago a woman was buried deep within a cave on the Iberian peninsula, stained in sparkling red paint and adorned in yellow flowers. Her grave provides the first evidence of an ancient Magdalenian burial in the region and an engraved stone found near her remains appears to have been a makeshift tombstone. But the reasons why the female - dubbed 'The Red Lady of El Mirón' - was buried in such an elaborate tomb, close to an area where her peers would have lived day-to-day, continues to baffle archaeologists. The Red Lady's remains (burial site pictured) were found in the El Mirón Cave in Cantabria, Spain. Radiocarbon dating suggests she was buried 18,700 years ago. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal . During the Upper Paleolithic period the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC. Magdalenian hunters  lived in caves, but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins. The Red Lady's remains were first uncovered in 2010 during excavations of such a cave called El Mirón Cave in Cantabria between Santander and Bilbao. After discovering a range of individual bones, researchers from the University of New Mexico led by Lawrence Straus, unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. The Red Lady's remains were uncovered in 2010 during excavations of the El Mirón Cave in Cantabria. After discovering a series of individual bones, researchers  unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. Radiocarbon dating suggests this burial took place 18,700 years ago and that the female was aged between 35 and 40 when she was entombed. She was 'robust, relatively tall, [and] apparently healthy', explained the researchers , and would have lived in the 'cold, open environment of Oldest Dryas.' Herself and her peers would have used stone tools, needles made from bones and projectile tips fashioned from the antlers of the deer and the cave would have been used for shelter and living quarters. They would have hunted for ibex and red deer, fished for salmon and ate plants, including some seeds and mushrooms. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal. This has since faded. A engraved tombstone was found nearby. The pigment and tombstone has led researchers to speculate she was a person of status or authority and was ritualistically buried in such a way to oversee her subjects.

They would have hunted for ibex and red deer, fished for salmon and ate plants, including some seeds and mushrooms. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal. This has since faded. Haematite comes from the Greek word for 'blood' and it is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings. It is not known why the Red Lady was painted in this way, and the researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment. However, they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual. In Mayan practices, for example, bodies were covered in a similar way using blue pigment to signify they were sacrifices to the gods. But the fact she was buried within the living quarters of her peers has led the anthropologists to suggest she was instead a person of status or authority and was buried in such a way to oversee her subjects. This status is also hinted at due to the presence of a primitive tombstone. During the excavation a large rock was found that reportedly fell from the ceiling and had been engraved with straight lines. Among these engravings the researchers spotted a V-shaped motif  that they suggest represents a pubic triangle, while another has been speculatively referred to as a schematic hand with fingers. 'Could these be indicators of the presence of the woman buried behind the block?' said the researchers in their paper '""The Red Lady of El Mirón"". Lower Magdalenian life and death in Oldest Dryas Cantabrian Spain: an overview' published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. In addition there are lines engraved on the bedrock lower wall and ledge against which part of the corpse had been laid behind the block. The El Mirón site has been excavated 1996 as part of the by the El Mirón Prehistoric Project including Lawrence Guy Straus and Manuel González Morales. During the Upper Paleolithic the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC . Experts suggest the so-called 'Red Lady' was 'robust, relatively tall, [and] apparently healthy'. She would have lived in the 'cold, open environment of Oldest Dryas' and ate ibex, red deer and salmon. Her body was interred at the rear of the cave (pictured) where her peers would have lived and slept . Haematite comes from the Greek for 'blood' and red ochre (pictured) is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings. It is not known why the Red Lady was painted, and researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment. But, they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual . The eastern face of the block was additionally 'intensely stained' with red ochre in the area near where the bones were found, creating a link between the block and body. 'The ochre may constitute the only demonstrable “grave offering”,' continued the researchers. 'The burial is one of the most complex features of the Magdalenian record in El Mirón. 'The corpse seems to have been laid on her left side with her back toward the block and chest toward the cave wall. 'The head  would have been at the northern end of the burial. The corpse was probably tightly flexed in fetal position. 'Because many of the bones are stained with red ochre, it is possible that either the woman's clothes had been stained with this material - for decoration and/or hide preservation - or her corpse was stained as part of a burial ritual.' Anthropologists from the University of New Mexico said: 'The burial is one of the most complex features of the Magdalenian record in El Mirón. The corpse was probably tightly flexed in fetal position [and] seems to have been laid on her left side with her back toward the block and chest toward the cave wall' The cave site of El Mirón is in the Rio Asón valley of Cantabria, Spain (marked). Its opening is around 850ft (260 metres) above sea level and the inside is around 100ft (30 metres) deep, 52ft (16 metres wide) The cave site of El Mirón is in the Rio Asón valley of Cantabria, Spain. Its opening is around 850ft (260 metres) above sea level and the inside is around 100ft (30 metres) deep, 52ft (16 metres wide). Research has shown that the site was occupied from the Middle Paleolithic 41,000 years ago up to around 1400AD. During the Upper Paleolithic the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC. Magdalenian hunters  lived in caves, but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins. They predominantly hunted reindeer and evidence suggests they lived a somewhat nomadic life. In addition to El Mirón, Magdalenian sites have been found from Portugal in the west to as far east as Poland. The El Mirón site has been excavated 1996 as part of the by the El Mirón Prehistoric Project including Lawrence Guy Straus and Manuel González Morales from the Universidad de Cantabria. During the excavations, a large engraved rock was found. Among these engravings the researchers spotted a V-shaped motif that has been said to represent a pubic triangle, suggesting a female was buried nearby. The eastern face of the block (shown on the left of this map) was also stained' with red ochre . After discovering a series of individual bones (plotted by red dots), researchers unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. Radiocarbon dating suggests this burial took place 18,700 years ago and that the female was aged between 35 and 40 when she was entombed . In particular, its blood-red colour may have been symbolic of life and death. Following her burial, the anthropologists said the grave was partially disturbed by a wolf, or similar-sized carnivore. They then believe the skeleton was stained a second time and covered again. 'The scenario that is hypothesised is that the carnivore only minimally disturbed the skeleton, since the bones were unconnected by this time,' the experts continued. 'Then humans apparently found the exposed tibia and thus the rest of the skeleton. They may have removed the cranium and most of the largest bones without totally rearranging the fundamental anatomical order of the former corpse, whose hands may have been placed near her head and feet tucked under her bottom.' Using detailed mineralogical maps of the region, it is thought the Magdalenian people mined the distinctive ochre from an outcrop in the modern-day city of Santoña, situated around 12 miles (20km) from the cave. 'Although lacking in clear grave offerings, the amounts of red ochre on the bones and in the burial infilling and the apparent association with rock art - both engravings and red ochre on the block against which the corpse's back had probably rested - the evidence points to a ritualized interment,' concluded the researchers. 'But, at the end of the day, we are left with a mystery: who was the “Red Lady” of El Mirón and why was she given such special treatment after her death?'","Remains of the Magdalenian 'Red Lady' were uncovered in El Mirón cave .

"A valet parking attendant managed to plough a 200mph supercar through the front of a shop after mistaking the brake for the throttle in a Ferrari 599 GTO worth £300,000. The Dutch owner of the 2012 supercar was waiting in the Hotel Exedra after attending a meeting of the Ferrari Owner's Club with his wife in Anzio, south of Rome. The car's owner entrusted the car, which is one of the most powerful ever produced by Ferrari, to a parking attendant who attempted to return it to the hotel in a timely manner.

The £300,000 supercar can hit 60mph in just 3.3 seconds and ploughed through the shop front . However, instead of pressing the brake when approaching a shop front, the driver mashed the throttle, unleashing 671bhp from the magnificent 6.0-litre V12 engine, which ordinarily could propel the car to 60 miles per hour in less than 3.5 seconds.

"You could be forgiven for thinking it was a perfectly sensible message about personal safety. But a police poster advising women to stick together on a night out provoked anger yesterday, as campaigners claimed it suggested victims were responsible for sex attacks. Sussex Police was accused of ‘victim-blaming’ in its campaign, which urges women not to leave their friends alone or let them wander off with strangers. Women’s rights groups said rapists were to blame for sex attacks, not their victims. Anti-rape campaigners have criticised the  message in this Sussex Police poster arguing it implies that victims are to blame for getting raped . But the poster won praise from supporters who said it was ‘blindingly obvious’ that it was not blaming women, and that it simply offered ‘sensible advice’. It features a picture of two smiling young women posing for a selfie, with the text: ‘Which one of your mates is most vulnerable on a night out? The one you leave behind.’ It goes on: ‘Many sexual assaults could be prevented. Stick together and don’t let your friend leave with a stranger or go off on their own.’ But anti-rape campaigners said police should target potential attackers instead, and that the poster sent a message that women needed a constant chaperone. Sarah Green, acting director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said she found the advice ‘infuriating’. She added: ‘We need to get beyond police campaigns giving instructions to women on how to behave to be safe. We need to talk to those who may perpetrate rape and deter them.’ Campaign: The posters are due to be put up in pub and club toilets as well as bus stops in Brighton (pictured) as well as other areas of Sussex . A pair of police officers watch on as University students gather on the street outside a bar in Brighton . Fabia Bates, of the Survivors’ Network, said: ‘Sussex Police has made great strides to encourage people to report sexual violence and there is the possibility this could damage people’s confidence. ‘We are here to support anyone who has been the victim and will not judge anyone – it is never the victim’s fault.’ Chief Inspector Katy Woolford said the police had a responsibility to advise potential victims on how to minimise risks . But David Davies, a former special constable who is running for re-election as Tory MP for Monmouth, said he thought the poster offered ‘common sense advice’, adding: ‘I don’t think it’s blaming victims ... it’s like telling people to lock car doors. I would say the same to young men, not to leave their mates behind in what could be a dangerous area because they could get robbed or sexually assaulted. ‘It’s disappointing that some groups don’t realise police are trying to help prevent problems. ‘No one’s suggesting the attacker doesn’t bear responsibility, the police are simply trying to make sure people are aware of danger and try to avoid it. It’s blindingly obvious.’ Clarence Mitchell, who is standing as the Tory candidate in Brighton Pavilion, agreed. ‘I’m quite sure that Sussex Police in no way intended to imply that women are somehow responsible for any attack,’ he said. ‘This is an entirely sensible campaign.’ Sussex Police said the posters would be put up at bus stops and in pub and nightclub toilets. Chief Inspector Katy Woolford said: ‘Rape is never a victim’s fault, but as with all crimes we can reduce the number of victims in several ways. ‘It is vital to be aware of vulnerability so that steps can be taken to guard against it.’ In 2012 West Mercia Police were forced to apologise for posters for its Safe Night Out initiative suggesting rape victims were to blame if they were drunk . Manchester Police were praised by anti-rape groups for their 2014 Christmas anti-rape campaign which carried the strapline: 'Drinking is not a Crime. Rape is' .","Sussex Police poster features two young women taking a selfie .

"Chaos erupted at an Easter egg hunt in Sacramento when adults launched in trying to grab sweets for their children. The event was an attempt at breaking the record for the world's biggest, with 500,000 eggs laid out for thousands of youngsters. But it descended into mayhem as parents raced into the field armed with baskets of their own. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Chaos: An attempt at the world's biggest Easter egg hunt in Sacramento became shambolic on Sunday . Mayhem: Children as young as two were pushed to the ground as adults invaded the children-only event . 'There was no organization at all, they all trampled each other. Little two- and three-year-olds were crying. 'The parents were scooping up all of the eggs for their older kids and it was horrible,' mother Tessa Moon told CBS. Another mother, Kori Houser, told Sacramento Bee her toddler Chase  only got three eggs: 'It was crazy. Adults were trampling over us.' Footage of the hunt, which did not break the world record because they missed the deadline to apply, shows children as young as two being squashed by teenagers and adults weave between them picking up candy. According to Sacramento Bee, toddlers were seen crying and parents were being pushed around in the calamity. Eventually, the paper reported, a screaming match broke out between parents. Enraged parents said older children were rushing around to snap up candy meant for youngsters . The event, which did not break the world record, was raising money for victims of human trafficking . Children were presented with 500,000 eggs on the Capitol Mall lawn on Sunday . Divided: Some families left half-way through to escape the chaos . However, the organizers urged people to remember the reason for the event: to raise money for survivors of human trafficking. They spent $10,000 transporting 510,000 plastic eggs from Florida. Children raced to collect as many as they could, and later exchanged them for candy. A VIP off-shoot of the event featured some plastic eggs stuffed with food vouchers. It cost $20 to take part. 'We’re doing this to raise awareness for Blue Heart International the nonprofit my wife and I started,' Blake McCall, founder of Blue Heart International, told CBS. 'We’re really passionate about helping children rescued out of human trafficking in our community.' Organizers reminded people the event was planned for a good cause .","Thousands of children turned out for the event in Sacramento, California .

"For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but now new research is questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt . For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but new research is now questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt. Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year. As the federal government prepares its influential Dietary Guidelines for 2015, some scientists are now saying that the average American salt consumption rate carries no risk. The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2,300 milligrams, with an even stricter 1,500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50. In February the  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended keeping the larger limit, although it withdrew support for the stricter limit for African Americans and people over 50, reports The Washington Post. 'There is no longer any valid basis for the current salt guidelines,' said Andrew Mente, a professor at McMaster University in Ontario and one of the researchers involved in a major study published last year by the New England Journal of Medicine. 'So why are we still scaring people about salt?' While experts on both sides agree that eating too much salt - especially for people with high blood pressure - can be dangerous there is much disagreement over what constitutes too much. The average American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day - the amount of sodium in a teaspoon of salt - and so under the current dietary guidelines Americans are indeed endangering themselves. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement with at least one former president claiming that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure . Salt skeptics however believe most Americans are fine. In their view, a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks. The skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little - they say that below 3,000 milligrams also raises health risks. The PURE study published last August by the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who conform to the recommended limits (2,300 milligrams) actually have more heart trouble. They found that low sodium may stimulate the production of renin, a hormone that may have harmful effects on blood vessels. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement. 'The totality of the evidence strongly suggests that Americans should be lowering their sodium intake,' said Elliott Antman, the president of the American Heart Association. 'Everyone agrees that current sodium intake is too high.' But Suzanne Oparil, a former president of the American Heart Association, told the Post that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services has said that the federal guidelines are considering comments from the public and the advice of its science panel.","Current federal government guidelines dictate the people should limit their salt intake to 2,300 milligrams .

"London Midland has vowed to give police CCTV images of a 'disgusting' passenger suspected of defecating inside a train carriage as it travelled through the Birmingham area. The passenger who made the awful discovery said the smell was so bad that it forced the operator to cancel the service from Lichfield Trent Valley to Longbridge. It plunged commuters into hours of misery as the act of vandalism on the Cross City line caused severe delays. A passenger made the awful discovery on a train travelling between Lichfield Trent Valley and Longbridge . Passenger Christopher Talbot told the Birmingham Mail he was heading to work on the 7:50am service on Thursday when he found  excrement in a newspaper on the floor. He said: ‘As I sat down I saw a newspaper on the floor. I leaned over and noticed there was something inside it. ‘It looked like poo basically. The smell was going through the carriage. These trains have toilets on.’ The 52-year-old, who works as a cleaner at a school, said there was only one other passenger in the carriage, and he reported the incident to platform staff when he disembarked at Butlers Lane in Four Oaks. London Midland said that CCTV images of the culprit would be passed onto police for investigation . The service terminated at Birmingham New Street so that the carriage that was used as a toilet could be cleaned. Normal service resumed at about 9:30am. A Network Rail spokeswoman confirmed to MailOnline Travel that excrement was discovered inside a carriage. A spokesman for London Midland said the 'act of vandalism' was 'disgusting'. The service terminated at Birmingham New Street so that the carriage could be cleaned . He added: ‘It was necessary for the train to be cleaned before we could continue to let passengers onto the service. ‘I would like to apologise to our genuine passengers who experienced the disruption.’ London Midland confirmed that CCTV images of the culprit, who fled the train, would be passed onto police for investigation. A British Transport Police spokeswoman told MailOnline Travel that it has no record of a formal complaint being filed. A similar incident occurred last month when a British Airways flight was forced to return to London after a foul odour emanated from an overflowing toilet. Passenger Abhishek Sachdev, a councillor who represents Potters Bar Parkfield, said the seven-hour flight to Dubai was aborted ‘because of a smelly poo in the toilet'.","A passenger discovered excrement in a newspaper on a Cross City train .

"Despite being fierce rivals, Apple and Samsung have a somewhat symbiotic relationship when it comes to manufacturing their handsets. Now it has been reported that the Korean tech giant will be the main supplier of the A9 chips in Apple's upcoming iPhone range. Although this isn't the first time Samsung has manufactured parts for iPhones, it signals that the frosty partnership between the two may be thawing. Samsung will reportedly be the main supplier of the A9 chips in Apple's upcoming iPhone range. Samsung has previously supplied Apple with various iPhone parts, but following legal disputes, Apple shifted away from its rival and signed a monopoly deal with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) in 2013 . Apple relies heavily on other firms to produce the various components it uses in its iPhones and iPads. And for years, Samsung was a dominant member of this group. It produced the flash and working memory in the iPhone 4, for example, and was a substantial Apple chip partner until 2013. However, following legal disputes, Apple shifted away from Samsung and signed a deal with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) to produce the A7 seen in the iPhone 5S. Samsung has announced better-than-expected profits for the first quarter of 2015. A rising demand for memory chips is said to be helping offset a slump in the firm's smartphone sales. During a call on Tuesday, the electronics giant estimated an operating profit of 5.9 trillion won ($5.4 billion/£3.6 million) between January and March. This beat analyst expectations and was up 11.5 per cent from the previous quarter. But this forecast was down 30.5 per cent from a year ago. It didn't cut Samsung off completely, though, and around 40 per cent of chips in the iPhone 6 are still made by the Korean giant or partners. But by handing the monopoly to TSMC, it directly affected Samsung's business. Reports of the A9 deal first appeared last year when a 'source familiar with the deal' told The Korea Times: 'Apple has designated Samsung as the primary supplier of its next chips powering iOS devices from 2016.' The deal is said to be worth 'billions of dollars.' From next year, this report continued Samsung will supply 80 per cent of Apple's supply of application processors, with TSMC supplying the remaining 20 per cent. Samsung then confirmed it was planning to mass produce its latest chips later this year. The Korean firm recently partnered with New York-based semiconductor experts GlobalFoundries. It was said to be this deal that appealed to Apple because it will help Samsung meet the demand for Apple's chips globally, and lets GlobalFoundries use Samsung's latest technology patents. As part of this deal, Bloomberg said Samsung will start making the A9 at its Giheung plant in South Korea, with additional orders going to Globalfoundries. Reports of the A9 deal first appeared last year when a 'source familiar with the deal' told The Korea Times that Apple had designated Samsung as the primary supplier of its next iOS chip in 2016.  Samsung will supply 80% of Apple's supply of application processors, with TSMC supplying the remaining 20% . Earlier today, Samsung announced better-than-expected profits for the first quarter of 2015 thanks to a rising demand for memory chips. But profits are predicted to be 30.5% down compared to this time last year. This follows news Samsung is facing a 'bendgate' controversy after a video showed its S6 bending and shattering . Earlier today Samsung announced better-than-expected profits for the first quarter of 2015. A rising demand for memory chips is said to be helping offset a slump in the firm's smartphone sales, but profits are predicted to be 30.5 per cent down compared to this time last year. This follows news Samsung is facing a 'bendgate' controversy, after famously mocking Apple when it emerged its iPhone 6 Plus could bend out of shape in people's pockets. A video from warranty firm SquareTrade shows the Galaxy S6 Edge bending under similar pressure as the iPhone 6. But, more importantly, the screen on the S6 Edge shattered during this test, while Apple's didn't. This led to Samsung releasing its own video, demonstrating a three-point bend test on both its Galaxy S6 models. 'We are confident that all our smartphones are not bendable under daily usage,' the company said in a statement. SquareTrade found that the Galaxy S6 Edge  bends and shatters under 110lbs (50kg) of pressure. It also tested the HTC One M9 both deformed and broke at 120lbs (54kg). Samsung added that the test done by SquareTrade 'does not show the strength of the back side' and it has now asked SquareTrade to do the test again on both the front and back sides of the device. Apple had to go to similar lengths during its own 'Bendgate' crisis, by allowing reporters into its labs to showcase iPhone 6 Plus durability tests. The teardown shows, from the front, the screen, logic board holder, battery, logic board with processor, camera, rear case and antenna. It is a fascinating view of exactly what goes into a modern smartphone - and how Samsung does business. The Chipworks site has posted this amazing image revealing the internals of the firm's Galaxy S6, which goes on sale on April 10th. The internals reveal Samsung used more of its own chips to power the new Galaxy S6 smartphone than it did for the predecessor S5, according to an early teardown report, in a blow to U.S. chip supplier Qualcomm. Samsung is not only using its own Exynos mobile processor, as had been widely reported, but also decided to rely on its in-house semiconductor business to source other parts, including the modem and power management integrated circuit chips, Ottawa-based consultancy Chipworks said. Samsung is counting on its new flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 edge phones to help revive earnings momentum after a disappointing 2014. Strong sales of system chips such as its Exynos processor could also help boost earnings, analysts and investors say. The Galaxy S6 also comes with Samsung's Shannon modem chip, U.S. phone carrierAT&T said on its website.","Reports claim Samsung will make the A9 chips for Apple's next iPhone .

"A series of thought-provoking clothing labels have been photographed in a bid to raise awareness of the horrific plight of those toiling in sweatshops around the world. The Canadian Fair Trade Network is hoping the images will make people think about the garments they are wearing and just where they have come from. Teaming up with the advertsiing agency Rethink, the photographs feature clothing labels telling the tragic stories of factory workers from Bangladesh, Cambodia and Sierra Leone. Each label says that the product is 100 per cent cotton - but adds that is not the whole story and follows on with a snap shot of just who could have made the item. Scroll down for video . The label in the red hooded top highlights the case of 34-year-old Tejan who had been coughing up blood but carried on working for fear of losing his job . One of the labels, sewn into a yellow, cable jumper, reveals a day in the life of Behnly and reads: 'Made in Cambodia by Behnly, nine years old. He gets up at 5am every morning to make his way to the garment factory where he works. 'It will be dark when he arrives and dark when he leaves. He dresses lightly because the temperature in the room he works reaches 30 degrees. 'The dust in the room fills his nose and mouth. He will make less than a dollar, for a day spent slowly suffocating. A mask would cost the company ten cents.The label doesn’t tell the whole story.' A red hooded top focuses on the life of Tejan, a father-of-two, and bears the label: 'Made in Sierra Leone by Tejan. The first few times he coughed up blood he hid it from his family. They couldn’t afford medical treatment and he couldn’t risk losing his long-time job at the cotton plantation. This label describes the story of Behnly, nine, who has been working since 5am . 'When he fell into a seizure one day it could no longer be ignored. The diagnosis was pesticide poisoning. 'The lack of proper protective clothing has left him with leukemia at the age of 34. He has two daughters. One of them starts work at the factory next year. The label doesn’t tell the whole story.' The final image, of a smart jacket, highlights a working day for 12-year-old Joya. The label says: 'Made in Bangladesh by Joya who left school at the age of 12 to help support her two brothers and newly widowed mother. 'Her father was killed when a fire ripped through the cotton factory where he works. She now works in the building across the street from the burned down factory. A constant reminder of the risk she takes everyday.' The jacket was made by 12-year-old Joya, says the label, who has to support her family after losing her father in a factory fire opposite where she is working . 'It's time for change,' said the Canadian Fair Trade Network. 'Buying fairtrade ensures workers are being compensated fairly and not exposed to unsafe working conditions.' Rachel Wilshaw, Oxfam's ethical trade manager, said the charity welcomed the campaign. 'Oxfam welcomes campaigns like this which use a creative approach to making consumers aware of the plight of garment workers on poverty wages,' she said. 'In Bangladesh for instance, the minimum wage is just $68 a month, far too low to support a family, an issue that Oxfam highlights in our report Even it Up! Time to End Extreme Inequality. 'Consumers concerned to find out which brands are tackling poverty wages can refer to Oxfam's new briefing paper Steps towards a living wage in global supply chains.' The conditions of workers in clothing factories came under the spotlight following the collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on 24 April, 2013. The tragedy resulted in the death of 1,129 people and a further 2,515 people were injured, many of whom were making clothing for big name brands. The incident saw the launch of Fashion Revolution Day, a now annual event which takes place on 24 April and invites people from around the world to turn their clothing inside out to display the label, take a selfie and ask #whomademyclothes via Twitter.","Fair Trade photographs aim to focus on the people in sweatshops .

"Aliens are often portrayed as diminutive beings, but in ‘reality’ they could be much larger and heavier than science fiction films suggest. Scientist Fergus Simpson has calculated the minimum size needed for intelligent life to survive, based on the laws of conservation of energy seen on Earth. And from this, he calculates that if intelligent extraterrestrials exist they will typically weigh 650lbs (300kg) - the median weight of a polar bear. Aliens (illustrated with a stock image) are often portrayed as diminutive beings, but in ‘reality’ they could be much larger, one scientist claims. Fergus Simpson from University of Barcelona applied a mathematical formula to assume aliens obey the same laws of conservation of energy as animals  on Earth . Mr Simpson came to this conclusion by applying a mathematical formula that assumes aliens obey the same laws of conservation of energy as animals do on Earth. This means that larger animals need more resources to survive, so are less common than plentiful ants, for example. The cosmologist’s calculations are also based on the idea that there’s a minimum size needed for intelligent life, but don’t factor in an alien planet’s gravity. ‘Throughout the animal kingdom, species which are physically larger invariably possess a lower population density, possibly due to their enhanced energy demands,’ he wrote in a paper, published at arXiv.org. He said there must be a minimum body size necessary for supporting intelligent life, based on the range of body sizes of intelligent animals such as apes and humans, found on Earth. ‘As a result, we should expect humans to be physically smaller than most other advanced species.’ '...we conclude that most species are expected to exceed 300kg in body mass. The median body mass is similar to that of a polar bear.' He claims that just as it is on Earth, there are probably more small animals than larger ones in the universe, but that the larger a planet or biosphere the more likely it is to have evolved an intelligent species. Mr Simpson said there must be a minimum size necessary for supporting intelligent life, based on the range of body sizes of intelligent animals such as apes and humans, found on Earth. And, if they exist, he believes intelligent aliens typically weigh more than 650 lbs (300kg) - around the size of a polar bear (stock image) His argument follows that if clever aliens are large, there may be fewer of them, as they will likely live in a society with low population densities to ensure they have the resources they need. Study claims aliens are larger than those portrayed in sci-fi (stock image). But the calculations don't take into account an alien planet’s surface gravity . Commenting on the study, Duncan Forgan, a Research Fellow at the University of St Andrews, told NewsWeek:  ‘I think the average size calculation is reasonable’. Seth Shostak, a researcher at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, added that it is not the first time scientists have suggested that aliens may be large, because big animals tend to live longer. A longer lifespan makes creatures potentially more likely to develop knowledge and invent technology needed to make contact with humans one day. Mr Simpson continued: ‘Higher intelligence enables the development of technologies which can sustain larger population sizes.’ While the research has been described as interesting by Dr Shostak, he said ‘there’s no concrete data to work with’ and that Earth is being used as a model to predict what life looks like elsewhere in the universe – but aliens may be completely different. He pointed out that it is humans’ thumbs, bipedal stance and brains, rather than our bulk, that has enabled us to thrive on Earth, so body mass is only one indicator of intelligence. ‘Polar bears are large but do not write great literature and build radio towers and a lot of that is probably because they are walking around on all fours,’ he said. Mr Forgan also noted that the research doesn’t take an alien planet’s surface gravity into account. He explained that planets with stronger gravity might be expected to be home to smaller life forms than those with weaker gravity, which means that the calculation is incomplete.","Fergus Simpson said aliens probably weigh more than 650 lbs (300kg)
Calculations based on idea that there’s a minimum size  for intelligent life .
Larger aliens are more likely to live long enough to make advanced tech .

"Prehistoric man sketched an incredible array of prehistoric beasts on the rough limestone walls of a cave in modern day France 36,000 years ago. Now, with the help of cutting-edge technology, those works of art in the Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave have been reproduced to create the biggest replica cave in the world. The manmade cavern named the Caverne du Pont-d'Arc has been built a few miles from the original site in Vallon-Pont-D'arc in Southern France and contains 1,000 painstakingly-reproduced drawings as well as around 450 bones and other features. Scroll down for video . Cavemen and women sketched an incredible array of prehistoric beasts on the rough limestone walls of a cave 36,000 years ago and now a replica has been created (pictured) The replica cave (pictured) contains 1,000 painstakingly reproduced drawings, as well as bones and other debris . It contains pictures of oxen, cows, deer and other animals the original artists used as inspiration . The original and unique ‘Grotte Chauvet’ was discovered around 20 years ago and is a Unesco World Heritage Site. It is the oldest known and the best preserved cave decorated by man, but is not open to the public and is only seen by a handful of experts every year, in order to keep the precious works of art safe. Now experts have scanned the original drawings using 3D modelling techniques to capture each marking and position them correctly on the bumpy replica walls to the millimetres. The replica cave (pictured) has been built near Vallon-Pont-D'arc in Southern France and contains 1,000 painstakingly-reproduced drawings of 425 animals as well as around 450 bones . It is the oldest cave decorated by man – and the best preserved, but is not open to the public to keep the precious works of art safe. It bears images of woolly rhinos for example (the replica drawings are shown) ‘The most remarkable paintings, engravings, palaeontological and essential geological representations are reproduced full-scale from the scanned originals,’ promotional material says. ‘The objective is to reproduce the emotions originally aroused by the cave and to reveal its hidden world.’ The drawings include images of 14 different species such as cave bears, woolly rhinoceros, mammoths and big cats, some of which are the only representations in Palaeolithic cave art. Unique representations include a panther, owl and even part of the female body, making the original site an invaluable research subject for scientists around the world.

The replica cave (pictured) will open to the public on April 25. Pictured is a drawing of a horse that adorns its roof . The replica cave reproduces the complex and turbulent works of art depicted in the Decorated Cave of Pont-d’Arc. Specialists used 3D modelling and anamorphic techniques, the latter of which is used to shoot widescreen images. Using a high-precision scanner, a three-dimensional digital model of the cave was created. Experts first modelled the cave’s continuous surface and then made it fit the new space accordingly. They took 6,000 digital photos of the artwork, allowing it to be copied accurately. Images were placed on the corresponding computerised cave-walls before being transferred onto the physical replica. The new cave also includes replica paw prints of  bears, bones and details preserved in the original cave. But while the real cave is 91,490 square feet (8,500 metres) the replica is 32,290 square feet (3,000 square metres) in area and visitors to the attraction, which opens on April 25, will be able to take in the artwork while standing on a raised walkway. Promotional material for the replica says: ‘Today, the bold alliance of artistic creation and the most advanced technologies, some of which were used for the first time, make of this replica a true prototype. ‘…The Decorated Cave of Pont-d’Arc is an invitation to a journey back in time, a wonderful dive into the heart of humanity and a major landmark in the history of civilisation. ‘Our ambition is to give visitors the opportunity to feel the same emotions, experience the same sensations and the surprise to discover a unique place in the world.’ Hervé Saulignac, President of the General Council of the Ardèche and Vice-President of the Rhône-Alpes Region, said: ‘36 000 years separate us from these men, highflying artists, who settled there, a few metres from a river that still defines our territory.

"Frank Sinatra underwent a vasectomy so could not have fathered Ronan Farrow, according to his youngest daughter, Tina Sinatra. Showbiz 411's Roger Friedman said that the 66-year-old laughed when he asked her if Mia Farrow's son Ronan was her brother. He said that Tina, who is the daughter of  Sinatra and his first wife Nancy, told him: 'Couldn't be. Frank had a vasectomy before that. I don't know whose son Ronan is.' Scroll down for video . Frank Sinatra (left) underwent a vasectomy so could not have fathered Ronan Farrow, (right) according to his youngest daughter, Tina Sinatra . Mia Farrow had previously admitted the singer may be the father of her Ronan (both pictured) It has never been reported before that Sinatra underwent the medical procedure. In 2013, Mia Farrow admitted that Frank Sinatra may be the father of her son, instead of Woody Allen. Tina Sinatra, 66, ridiculed claims Ronan Farrow was her brother . Rumours . about the parentage of her son Ronan, 27, have long dogged the actress, and she addressed the issue in the interview saying the legendary crooner was 'possibly' his father. Ronan Farrow later responded by tweeting: 'Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son.' Farrow, now 70, said that Sinatra was the great love of her life, and says, 'We never really split up.' Farrow married Sinatra in 1966 in Las Vegas when she was 21 and he was 50. The marriage fell apart 18 months later when she refused to drop her critically-acclaimed performance in Rosemary's Baby to star in a movie with her husband. They divorced in 1968. Two years later, Farrow married German-Austrian pianist Andre Previn. The couple adopted three children and also had three biological children before divorcing in 1979. In 1980, Farrow started a long-term relationship with Woody Allen, although the two never lived together. She and the children stayed in her massive Upper West Side New York apartment while he had a home on the other side of the city. Farrow became Allen's muse and starred in 13 of his films, most notable Hannah And Her Sisters in 1986. Earlier bonds: Woody Allen and Mia Farrow walk as Mia carries their son Satchel, who later changed his name to Ronan . 1966: Actress Mia Farrow married Sinatra in Las Vegas when she was 21 and he was 50. 1968: The couple split just 18 months after getting married and got divorced. 1971: Mia Farrow then married German-Austrian pianist Andre Previn.They went on to adopt three children - Lark Song, Summer Daisy Song, and Soon-Yi - and had three biological children - twins Matthew and Sascha and finally Fletcher. 1976: Frank Sinatra married Barbara Marx.1979: Farrow and Previn divorced. 1980: Farrow started dating Woody Allen. They adopted two girls - Moses and Dylan. 1987: Farrow gave birth to a boy, Ronan, on December 19. Ronan was the only biological child of the couple. 1992: The couple split when Farrow discovered Allen was having an affair with her oldest adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, then 22. 1992 - 1995: Farrow went on to adopt six more children - Tam, Kaeli-Shea, Frankie-Minh, Isaiah Justus, Thaddeus Wilk and Gabriel Wilk. 1998: Frank Sinatra died. He was still with his third wife Barbara Marx at the time of his death after 22 years of marriage. 2013: Farrow has now suggested Sinatra may be Ronan's father as they never 'really split up'. Farrow gave birth to Ronan in 1987 - he was their only biological child. Her relationship with Allen ended in 1992 when she discovered he was having an affair with her oldest adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, then 22. The news that Allen may indeed be his father may not be welcome to Ronan - the pair had a very public falling out when Allen began his romantic relationship with Previn. 'He's my father and married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression,' Ronan has said. 'I cannot see him. I cannot have a relationship with my father and be morally consistent... I lived with all these adopted children, so they are my family. 'To say Soon-Yi was not my sister is an insult to all adopted children,' Ronan said of the relationship. Allen later responded to Farrow's claims saying it was possible that Ronan was not his son. Allen wrote claimed that mother Mia Farrow may have been lying about it for decades. The Annie Hall director said Ronan, his only biological child with Farrow, ‘looks a lot like Frank’ thanks to his blue eyes and similar facial features. Allen said that if it were true then Farrow would have kept a dark secret during their bitter custody battle 21 years ago to make him pay child support. In a 2005 interview, Allen confirmed that he no longer has relationships with his three children from his relationship with Farrow. 'Well, I feel terrible about it. I spent millions of dollars and fought in court for years to do it, but could not swing it,' he told Vanity Fair. When Vanity Fair asked Sinatra's daughter about Ronan being treated as if he were a member of her family, Nancy Sinatra Jr told them: 'He is a big part of us, and we are blessed to have him in our lives.'","Tina Sinatra, 66, laughed when he asked if Mia Farrow's son Ronan, 27,  was her brother .

"A 25-year-old is facing jail on fraud charges after she allegedly faked having terminal cancer to her family and friends. Meaghan Hudson, 25, left those closest to her devastated when she sent text messages in December 2013, saying she was suffering from multiple myeloma, a type of cancer which forms in the bone marrow, and she was unlikely to survive. Miss Hudson's friends, who have known her since high school in Dayton, Ohio, went to great lengths to show their support - they shaved their heads in solidarity for her chemo and got matching tattoos of an inspirational song lyric. Scroll down for video . The nursing student raised $5,000 through a fundraising website after telling family and friends that she was suffering from cancer . Meaghan Hudson (pictured left) said she had multiple myeloma in 2013. Close friends (including Chelsey Whild, right) rushed to support her, even shaving their heads in solidarity and getting tattoos . The 25-year-old, who lives in Chula Vista, California, also had a fundraising website set up for her by her stepmother, Margaret Hudson. Well-wishers sent $5,000 towards her 'medical expenses' and high school friend Chelsey Whild also told NBC that a further $2,000 was raised for Meaghan at a bowling alley event. Miss Whild, who was one of a group of friends who shaved her head and got a tattoo, added: 'At one point there was the understanding that she may have had less than a year to live.' Meaghan's sister, Haley Hudson, said that Meaghan's closest family had also been deceived and they took her stories of doctor's appointments as the truth, unable to verify the information because they live in a different state. However Haley said that some details jarred with Meaghan's version of events. She told 10 News: 'Little stuff, like the fact that her hair grew back pretty thick and usually with cancer patients it doesn't.' Her sister believes that Meaghan's alleged stunt was a cry for attention. Last July, Meaghan's story fell apart after an anonymous tip was made to the Chula Vista Police Department saying that she didn't really have cancer. Police said the 25-year-old admitted to faking the disease. On August 23rd last year, Meaghan's stepmother, who lives in Texas, posted an emotional apology on Give Forward. She wrote: 'I am saddened, embarrassed, and ashamed to have to give you this news, especially via email. 'You are receiving this message because you contributed to the cancer fundraiser back in December 2013 for Meaghan Hudson. We have recently learned that Meaghan does not have cancer. While initially that sounds like good news (and it is in many ways), she has deceived her family and friends into believing she has been suffering from multiple myeloma for over a year now. Meaghan and friends got inspirational tattoos with the words 'sing on' after she told them that she was suffering from cancer in December 2013 . Hudson (left) with friends at a fundraising event for her cancer battle. Police received an anonymous tip last summer that she had been faking the disease which she owned up to . 'She is not sick, even despite her ongoing claims that she does have some type of illness that has simply not been diagnosed.' Margaret Hudson said that the family had learned the shocking news from police which also revealed to them that Meaghan had not attended San Diego State University as they had believed and did not have a nursing degree or license. The statement continued: 'She called her father on Wednesday night to confess to us personally and claims to be ready to make positive changes in her life. 'I know that you have given your hard earned money out of sincere concern and support for Meaghan and our family. I can't express to you how much I appreciate that and how very sorry I am that your generosity has been taken advantage of in this situation.' Mrs Hudson and Meaghan's father Sean then promised to pay back every person who had donated. Hudson was arrested in January and charged with theft by deception and grand theft. She is due in court on Monday. She is reportedly living with a friend and has not been in contact with her family and friends. The woman's devastated family were forced to post an apology to those who have donated money to her cancer campaign and vowed to pay every cent back .","Meaghan Hudson, 25, told family and friends in December 2013 that she was suffering from multiple myeloma and was unlikely to live .

But he admitted that he would break his drink ban at 6pm before heading into the studio for the showdown against Britain's six other political party leaders. admitted that he would break his drink ban at 6pm before heading into the studio for the showdown against Britain's six other political party leaders . Mr Farage, speaking on FubarRadio.com, said: 'I think that for a big event like this there is a risk people over-prepare. They are over-scripted. 'They have decided what their lines are before they go in front of the camera to answer the questions.' He added: 'I just want to keep my mind as clear as I possibly can and not have a drink – until after 6 o'clock.' A Ukip aide had previously admitted Mr Farage would have a drink or two ahead of the debate. Asked what preparations Mr Farage would be making today ahead of the debate, the spokesman said: 'He'll have a couple of gin and tonics and on you go.'

The PM later backtracked, insisting there will be 'no bodily contact' during the debate. All of the party leaders have spent the day preparing for tonight's debate, with Mr Cameron facing the prospect of having to defend the Tory-led government from attack on several fronts. Mr Cameron visited King's Leadership Academy in Warrington, where he spoke to pupils about their favourite sports. Chatting in a playground, the Tory leader said: 'In this debate tonight, jujitsu, is that the right thing?' To laughter he added: 'Shall I get Nigel Farage and put him on the floor, is that OK?'

"Friends of an Uzbekistani woman who died this week claim she was the world's oldest person ever having reached the age of 135. Tuti Yusupova's friends claim both her birth certificate and passport prove she was born on July 1, 1880. They now want the Guinness Book of Records to document that achievement. The current record holder is French woman Jeanne Calment, who was 122 when she died in 1997. Friends of Tuti Yusupova, pictured, who died this week claim she was the world's oldest person aged 135 . Officials in Uzbekistan support the claim, releasing Ms Yusupova's passport claiming she was born in 1880 . Ms Yusupova's death came in the same week as Misao Okawa, who died on April 1, a few weeks after she celebrated her 117th birthday. Ms Yusupova's funeral was attended by Baxadir Yangibaev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers in the autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan, in north west Uzbekistan. Mr Yangibaev said the evidence of Ms Yusupova's age was conclusive and this information would be passed onto the officials responsible for the Guinness Book of Records. He said Uzbekistan has to be one of the healthiest places in the world to live because out of its population of 30 million, they have 8,700 people who are more than 100. The 135-year-old pensioner recently appeared in a documentary 'Tuti Yusupova - Witness of three centuries. During the documentary, she said: 'I can tell you that the secret to a long life is to do lots of work in the fields and to live an honest life. Having lived through so many wars I would also tell the children of today to try and live their lives in the company of good people, and to appreciate times of peace.' At her 117th birthday party last month Ms Okawa said that her life had seemed 'rather short.' When asked the secret to long life, she said: 'I wonder about that too.'

"A catalogue of failings have been uncovered at two NHS hospitals after seven babies and three mothers died there in the space of just eight months. Independent investigators were called into Royal Oldham after the deaths of four babies and two mothers, and North Manchester General after the deaths of another three babies and one mother. Lisa Parkisson, 35, died at Oldham Royal 48 hours after giving birth in April this year, while newborn Thomas Beaty died at the same hospital in June after doctors pushed him back into the womb during birth. Lisa Parkisson, 35, (left with son Zac) died 48 hours after giving birth at Oldham Royal in June last year. Thomas Beaty (right) died from  at the same hospital after doctors forced him back into the womb . A summary of the investigation, which was kept secret from the families of the dead until now, has been seen by MailOnline and found 'notable absence of clinical leadership' in the maternity wards, and a 'failure to adequately plan care' in a number of cases. A team of independent investigators also found risk management was 'below standard' in some cases - though there were no apparent 'deficiencies in care' in the deaths of the three mothers. The report noted that several of the mothers were obese or morbidly obese, which can lead to complications, but that national guidelines for treating overweight people were not followed. Officials also criticised the hospital's own investigations, saying the root cause of the deaths was not always identified, opportunities to learn lessons were not always picked up, and that some recommendations were too general and difficult to measure. All of the deaths are believed to have occurred between December 2013, and July last year. In one case mother Lisa Parkisson, 35, also died 48 hours after giving birth to her son Zac in June this year. In another case newborn Thomas Beaty died from head injuries in April after medics forced him back into the womb during birth. Doctors had also tried and failed to remove him from the womb five times using forceps, despite national guidelines only recommending three attempts. While his death was not included in the review, staff at North Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which controls the two hospitals, have asked investigators to look into it. Martin Beaty, the father of Thomas, said: 'Ten deaths in eight months is sickening. But I'm not surprised. Independent investigators found failings in care and hospital leadership at Oldham Royal following the deaths of four babies and two mothers there in eight months . The report, which also looked into the deaths of three babies and another mother at North Manchester General, found that national guidelines for treating obese mothers were also not followed . 'The standard of care we received during and after Thomas died gives me zero confidence in their organisation, structure and accountability. 'I'm angry we were not informed [about the report], even if out of courtesy. It feels like they're trying to cover each other's backs. 'But I'm fully behind any action that makes sure this sort of thing is prevented in the future.' Pennine Acute is in the process of producing an action plan based on the recommendations from the findings. They include strengthening clinical leadership and risk management, making sure enough staff are on duty to ensure safety and reviewing the process for employing temporary locum doctors. Royal Oldham Hospital's new maternity unit, children's unit and neonatal intensive care unit opened in December 2012. The £44m facility became one of three specialist Greater Manchester neonatal centres as part of a controversial £120m shake-up which saw maternity units shut in Bury, Rochdale and Salford. Gill Harris, Chief Nurse at Pennine Acute, said: 'The Trust is always keen to learn and to improve care. We commissioned a review by experts from outside the Trust to look at the details of a small number of maternity cases at our hospitals. 'We are now considering that report and are developing a number of actions as a result to make some improvements to ensure we continue to provide the best quality of care for our patients. 'We deliver 10,000 babies each year and would like to reassure families about the safety of maternity services at our hospitals, but if any expectant mother has a concern they can contact their designated midwife to discuss this.' A spokeswoman for the Care Quality Commission, the health regulator, said: 'CQC is aware that Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust has recently initiated an external review into its maternity services and we are in close liaison with the trust, NHS England and local CCG regarding the review findings.'","Four babies and two mothers died in Oldham Royal hospital maternity unit .

More than 240 artists and animators worked full time for an entire year to produce the film using revolutionary techniques, and it is credited with helping boost the popularity of animation. Yellow Submarine was a critical success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album the following year. The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. Original examples of cels from Yellow Submarine are so sought after that experts have tipped the submarine cartoon to fetch £10,000 when it goes under the hammer on Thursday. Jim Lentz, director of animation art at Heritage Auctions which is hosting the sale in Dallas, Texas, said: 'Yellow Submarine is one of the most important animations of all time. Yellow Submarine was a success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album a year later . The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. The original cel is set to sell for £10,000 . 'It is a film that has stood the test of time and is as relevant today as when it was made in 1968. The Band Concert is the most expensive cel sold . The most expensive animation celluloid, known as cel, to be sold in the world is The Band Concert by Disney. The animation, which is noted as the first colour Mickey Mouse cartoon, was released in 1935. In the cartoon, Mickey is trying to lead a concert of the William Tell Overture, amid various distractions such as Donald Duck playing the wrong tune on his flute. The cel was sold in a private transaction in 1999 for a reported £280,000 ($420,000). 'The message of the film - all you need is love - is timeless. 'It is incredible to think the team behind the film put it together in only a year when at that time it would take up to four years to make a feature animation film. 'The animation was ground-breaking and that coupled with the fact that the film was all about the biggest band in the world is what made it so iconic. 'Amazingly, after the film was made the celluloid sheets were sold off in high street stores for as little as seven pounds. Now they are worth thousands.' 'This is a rare hand-painted colour model cel painted by the ink and paint department for cel and animation reference. 'It would be one of the earliest final versions of the Yellow Submarine hand-painted - it really is the holy grail of Yellow Submarine memorabilia. 'Since small stickers were used for when the sub travelled there are not really a great deal of Yellow Submarine cels out there. 'This comes from a former Yellow Submarine ink and paint department employee. 'It is an unusually large image. Colour model cels were used also to help determine the final approved colour scheme of the yellow submarine. 'Colour model cels from this film are very rare, and this is one of the single best cels of the Yellow Submarine we have seen.'

"Sexual assault charges were dropped against Uber driver Maxine Fohounhedo, 30, after he produced an audio recording from the night of the alleged attack . Sexual assault charges against a Chicago Uber driver have been dropped after prosecutors heard a secret recording he made of his passenger the night of the alleged attack. Maxine Fohounhedo, 30, was charged in December with kidnapping and raping a female passenger he picked up after she ordered an UberX ride the month before. The 22-year-old woman told police she was intoxicated  and fell in and out of consciousness during the ride with Fohounhedo. She alleged that she eventually woke up in Fohounhedo's apartment as he was having sex with her, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. The woman told police he then helped her into his car and drove her home. She called police the next day and a rape kit was administered at Swedish Covenant Hospital, the Chicago Tribune reported. Shady Yassin, Fohounhedo's attorney, claims the woman made a pass at his client when he first picked her up and then they 'went back to his place.' 'Whatever happened there did not arise to anything criminal,' Yassin said. According to Yassin, Fohounhedo made the nine-minute recording as he drove the woman home because 'he had a gut feeling he needed to protect himself'. 'She was having a friendly conversation with him,' Yassin said. 'And talking about her boyfriend and her work, and gave him a hug in the end.' Yassin said when Fohounhedo helped the woman out of his car she said 'thank you so much'. The attorney said prosecutors authenticated the recording after Fohounhedo turned over his phone. Shady Yassin, Fohounhedo's attorney, said the woman made the pass at his client when he first picked her up and then they 'went back to his place'. 'Whatever happened there did not arise to anything criminal,' he said. Fohounhedo's wife Sheena (right) said the couple will have to work to get past the incident . Fohounhedo was released from Cook County Jail on Monday night. He has spent the last four months behind bars. Sheena Fohounhedo, his wife, told ABC 7 the couple will have to work to get past the incident but that she is happy her husband is coming home . Fohounhedo was using his wife's Uber account, which is a violation of the company's policy, when he picked up the 22-year-old woman. Uber removed Fohounhedo from the service after he was charged with assault. Yassin said his client wasn't given a chance and that 'everybody immediately thought he was guilty'. He said Fohounhedo has no ill will against Uber but does not plan to work with the company again. Fohounhedo was just one of several Uber drivers who have been accused of sexual assault since the app was launched in the US in 2011. Another woman in Chicago sued the company earlier this year after her driver allegedly locked her in the car and groped her breast, legs and groin before she escaped.","Maxine Fohounhedo, 30, was charged in December with kidnapping and raping a female passenger who ordered an UberX ride .

"Indonesia's attorney-general has claimed that Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be put to death following the rejection of their last ditch legal appeals. The convicted Australian drug dealers learned about the ruling after an appeal against their death row sentence was allowed to proceed in Jakarta's state administrative court on Monday. The court decided against allowing the pair's lawyers to challenge Indonesian President Joko Widodo's decision to deny the two Australians clemency. Scroll down for video . Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran 's last-ditch legal appeal against their Indonesian death row sentence was heard on Monday in Jakarta's state administrative court . Indonesia's HM Prasetyo said the pair would be executed soon and there would be no more delays as their latest court challenge failed . But attorney-general HM Prasetyo says he will not wait for another court challenge. 'No, there shall be no more (delays),' he said after Monday's verdict. 'This is proof of their tendency to delay ... it's like toying with law.' The attorney-general argued clemency was a matter of presidential prerogative only. 'For me it's enough. It's finished. It's finished,' he said. Lawyers for the men now plan to challenge the constitutional court to outline the president's obligations in clemency. They argue the executions should be stayed pending the new action, to be filed this week. The unusual appeal in the state administrative court was likely the pair's last legal avenue to save them from the firing squad for their part in the 2005 Bali Nine heroin smuggling bid. Sydney men Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, have been awaiting execution on the death island of Nusakambangan with seven other prisoners after they were transferred from their home of almost ten years – Bali's notorious Kerobokan prison – in a dramatic show of force last month. No sparing: A judge (pictured) in the Indonesian state administrative court (pictured) reads out the decision in Jakarta on Monday ruling that Bali 9 ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will not be allowed to challenge the decision by President Joko Widodo to deny the Australians clemency . Shackled and handcuffed: Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran cut sad figures as they were escorted by four faceless Indonesian police officers across the tarmac after being taken from Korobokan prison in Bali to their final destination, Death Island . The federal government has also asked that new legal options be allowed to run their course. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the government was disappointed by the court verdict. 'Both men have undergone extensive rehabilitation and I will continue to make representations to my counterpart, just as Australia will continue to use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution,' Ms Bishop said in a statement. 'Again, the Australian government respectfully requests the president to review their pleas for clemency.' The court in February rejected their legal challenge for clemency, determining the decrees by President Widodo were not within its jurisdiction. Lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran Leonard Arpan last week said they had done their best for their Australian clients. President Joko Widodo (pictured) previously rejected the Australian pair's clemency bids without studying the individual merits of each case, lawyers for the Bali 9 duo argued in the last ditch appeal on Monday . The pair are currently being held in isolation on Nusakambangan prison island (above) where foreign drug dealers were executed on January 18 this year and where the two Australians may be shot dead by firing squads on the same night as nine other drug dealers . Family members of Australian death row prisoners Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran (pictured) leave Nusakambangan prison island after visiting the two prisoners in Batu or 'stone' prison on March 9 this year . On Sunday, Jakarta's Catholic Archbishop, Ignatius Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo, told reporters he was saddened by Indonesia's use of the death penalty, which he described as a 'failure of humanity'. Also distressing for the archbishop was the severe treatment of Chan and Sukumaran when they were moved last month from their Bali jail cells to Nusakambangan, which involved a fighter jet escort. 'These men were handcuffed, was it necessary to be guarded by Sukhoi?' he told reporters after his Easter Sunday service. Surrounded by armed police officers officers and on the road of no return, 33-year-old Australia Myuran Sukumaran looks up at Bali police commissioner Djoko Hariutomo who posed with the two condemned Australians before their take off from Denpasar airport for the two hour flight to 'death island' A smiling Djoko Hariutomo, the police commissioner of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, poses for a photo with his hand upon the shoulder of condemned prisoner Andrew Chan inside the plane before take off for the Australian Bali Nine kingpin's final flight to the island where he will be executed . 'For me that's not strictness, for me that's very saddening because it's obvious that power wants to show itself and human dignity is not cherished.' Jakarta is awaiting all of the 10 prisoners in line for the firing squad to run out of options for court appeals before setting a date for their executions. Sukumaran and Chan are facing execution alongside Filipino woman Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, French citizen Serge Areski Atlaoui, Ghanaian citizen Martin Anderson and the only Indonesian citizen among the group Zainal Abidin bin Mgs Mahmud Badarudin. Also facing the firing squad with the two Australians is Raheem Agbaje Salami, a Nigerian holding a Spanish passport, Brazilian citizen Rodrigo Gularte and Nigerian citizens Sylvester Obiekwe Nwolise and Okwudili Oyatanze.

"Alison Hall, 48, almost choked to death after a false nail in her pocket worked its way into her asthma inhaler. It then shot to the back of her throat when she took a puff . An asthma sufferer almost choked to death when she took a puff on her inhaler and nearly swallowed a false nail. Alison Hall, 48, was at work when she felt her chest tightening and took out her blue salbutamol inhaler. She took a sharp breath and felt something shoot to the back of her throat where it became lodged. The mother-of-one ran outside in a panic when a neighbour came to her rescue and began pounding her back before calling 999. After five minutes of choking, a false nail finally came loose from the back of her throat and fell out onto the pavement. Ms Hall, who works for a local authority, said it was part of a cheap £1.50 set she had used weeks before and had probably fallen in her pocket. She believes the nail may have worked its way inside the inhaler through a gap at the top. She added: 'The inhaler has a lid but the top is open. There is a millimetre gap on each side. I spoke to my doctor and she was mortified.' Ms Hall is now urging others to check their inhalers before use. She said: 'I check my inhaler constantly. I've been using it for about ten years now and I use it regularly. 'I can go days without using it but then at times I need to use it a lot more. 'At about midday I used it and I checked inside the mouth piece. Then I was in work and went in my pocket. I took the lid off and took a puff. 'Something went into the back of my throat and I started choking. I don't know how long that nail had been in there.' She added: 'My brain told me to run outside. There was a neighbour who was two doors down and I was trying to shout help. 'I kept thinking ""I'm going to die"". Blood started to come out of my mouth. 'The man started hitting and hitting me on my back. Then his wife came out and took over. Her husband then rang 999.' Scroll down for video .

It felt like more air was coming out than was going in.

Ms Hall, of Oldham, Greater Manchester, said: 'The paramedic and the doctor at the hospital said that I was one lucky lady. 'You don't know how scary it is until you go through it.

"A widow who was left £15million by a high-rolling gambler has launched a multi-million pound lawsuit against his family – claiming she is owed up to £385million more. Ruanne Dellal says her husband Jack was worth at least £400million when he died and the £15million left to her was an ‘absurd presentation’ of his true wealth. The former beauty queen has launched a High Court claim against his relatives, in which she claims the property tycoon must have given away vast chunks of his fortune in secret deals to his family. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Jack Dellal left his whole estate to wife Ruanne, but she is suing after discovering that it amounts to just £1.7million . Daughters: Mrs Dellal is suing six of her husband's children, including Gabrielle, left, and Jasmine, right . Mrs Dellal, 61, whose own assets have been valued at £41.5million, says she is owed a ‘reasonable provision’ following the death of the legendary gambler. Her late husband, known as ‘Black Jack’, was a regular at the gaming tables of casinos in Mayfair and Monaco and gambled £1.7million in a single night in 2006. His family dispute his widow’s allegations and the true extent of the tycoon’s wealth will now be scrutinised by the High Court, which will assess Mrs Dellal’s claim that she has been short-changed. She claims six of his children are the supposed beneficiaries of his alleged secret handouts. Siblings Lorraine, Diane, Gabrielle, Jasmine and Rowan were named along with son Guy, the father of Agent Provocateur lingerie model Alice Dellal. His grandson Alex and elderly sister Violet were also named. Yesterday, they failed in a bid to persuade a judge to throw out her claim before it could come to trial, setting the scene for a potentially explosive court battle. Mr Dellal, who was friends with celebrities including Sir Mick Jagger, was notoriously secretive about his financial dealings but is said to have gambled millions every year, regularly winning or losing up to a £1million a night. He died in October 2012, aged 89, and left his entire estate to Mrs Dellal, his second wife, with nothing to his six adult children from previous relationships as he said he had already made provisions for them. Mrs Dellal, a former Miss South Africa, received £15.4million and he also put £20million in a trust fund for their two children, now aged 15 and 12. Son: Guy Dellal, pictured with his wife Andrea, is also being sued by his stepmother over his father's will . Granddaughters: Guy is the father of model Alice Dellal, left, and shoe designer Charlotte Dellal, right . But she claims his fortune appears to have shrunk mysteriously between his 2006 will which named her as his sole beneficiary and his death six years later. Mr Dellal, who was born in Chorlton, Manchester, to Iranian émigré parents, made a fortune in textiles, merchant banking and property and his wealth was once said to top £1billion. Jack Dellal was the son of immigrants from Baghdad, and he started his career as a humbile textile dealer in his home city of Manchester. He became a multi-millionaire after starting a small banking business called Dalton Barton, which he sold to the bank Keyser Ullmann in 1972 for £58million - more than £700million in today's money. Mr Dellal used the proceeds of the deal to set up Allied Commercial Holdings, which he used as a vehicle for property dealings for the rest of his life. In 1989, he made a vast profit from the purchase of Bush House on the Strand in central London, which was the headquarters of the BBC World Service. Allied Commercial bought the building for £55million in 1987, and sold it on to Japanese firm Kato Kagaku for £130million just two years later. His final big deal came with the sale of the Art Deco Shell-Mex House, overlooking the Thames, which raked in a £150million profit when it changed hands in 2007. He had a son and four daughters from his first marriage to a former Israeli air stewardess, which ended in divorce, and two daughters from another relationship. He married his second wife in 1997 and transferred assets worth around £56million to his six eldest children shortly after that wedding. By 2007 the couple’s marriage was in trouble and they each consulted two of Britain’s leading divorce lawyers, Raymond Tooth and Sandra Davis. Records of those meetings, revealed to the High Court, were said to show Mr Dellal did not dispute he was worth £400million. The couple did not divorce, but Mrs Dellal claims her husband began funnelling huge amounts of money into trusts for his children without her knowledge, and had a £50million ‘secret stash’ hidden in an account. In his written ruling, High Court judge Mr Justice Mostyn said Mrs Dellal had argued a ‘strong’ case that her husband had access to ‘very considerable resources’, but said there was little evidence he had given it to his children in secret. He said: ‘It goes like this. If Jack was very rich, and if his estate appears to have mysteriously shrunk, then the money can only have gone to his blood family. There are no other candidates.’ Mr Dellal’s family asked the judge to throw the case out as they said she cannot prove he gave money to them. They also argued Mrs Dellal’s wealth meant there was ‘no prospect’ of the court awarding her any more money. She owns an £8.5million mansion in Regent’s Park, central London, a £3million townhouse in Mayfair, the couple’s £5million home in Hampshire, a £1.1million house in Cape Town in South Africa, cars, jewellery and art worth almost £6million and has investments in the Middle East worth £26.5million. Grandson: Art dealer Alex Dellal, pictured with his wife Elisa and their son Jack, is the son of Guy . She claims her fortune has been ‘somewhat diminished’ recently, although Mr Dellal’s relatives argued that was down to her own mismanagement. Mr Justice Mostyn said it would be unfair to dismiss Mrs Dellal’s case without further scrutiny of her late husband’s finances. No date has yet been set for the case to be heard.","Jack Dellal left his entire estate to wife Ruanne but it was worth just £15.4m .

"Charlie Chaplin's divorce papers lay bare the film star's 'cruel and inhumane' treatment of his teenage bride during their short-lived marriage. Chaplin's union to Lita Grey, who was nearly 20 years his junior, lasted just three years. The iconic film star was said have bedded the impressionable 16-year-old after promising her marriage and then tried to convince her to have an abortion when she fell pregnant. On the pairs wedding night Chaplin was also said to have confided in friends that the union was a better prospect than prison. An original copy of the couples 50-page divorce papers was set to fetch an estimated £15,000 when it goes under the hammer, after being found in America. The 50-page divorce papers of Charlie Chaplin and his second wife Lita Grey were found in a bank in America . Charlie Chaplin, left, married second wife Lita Grey, right, who was nearly 20 years his jounior, in 1924 and the union lasted for just three years . The divorce papers are set to fetch an estimated £15,000 when they go under the hammer in Plymouth . Chaplin, then 35, married his second wife Lita, 16, in 1924. They divorced just three years later with the teenager lifting the lid on their marriage. In the papers it was alleged that Chaplin slept with the 'virtuous and inexperienced' Lita when she was barely 16 after promising to marry her. On their wedding night Chaplin was said to have told friends that the marriage was a better option than prison. He said to Lita: 'This marriage won't last long, I will make you so damn sick of me that you won't want to live with me.' Another part claims Chaplin delayed marrying Lita after she fell pregnant in an attempt to get her to have an abortion or 'criminal operation'. And the silent movie star was accused of calling his young bride a 'gold digger' who tried to ruin his career and stood in the way if his professional success. The papers also contain an order stopping Chaplin from moving his wealth before the settlement so it would not affect the court proceedings. Only around 16 copies of the divorce proceedings were believed to have been made, one sent to Chaplin himself and the others sent to various film companies and banks, involved in the proceedings. The papers for sale in Devon, were sent to the 1st National Bank of Los Angeles on the 11th Jan 1927. Almost a century later they are being sold by Parade Antiques on Plymouth for £15,000. The papers for sale were sent to the 1st National Bank of Los Angeles on the 11th Jan 1927 . Lita claimed that she endured 'cruel and inhumane' treatment by Chaplin in the legal papers . John Cabello, who owns the antiques shop, said: 'We got it from a person in America - he was told to clear out some supplies and old documents at the bank and he found them. 'He was told they would be thrown away and he kept them instead. 'When the papers were published, Chaplin was ostracised for a while. People in the know thought he was quite a nasty piece of work. 'All this comes out and makes for quite hard reading, even by today's standards.' Rob Morrish, 27, who runs the shop's website, poured over the historic legal documents. The 27-year-old said: 'About a week's worth of work went into researching the document, reading through it took some time. 'It's all hand signed and very old and fragile. It was folded for a long time and required a lot of very careful handling.' The papers reveal intimate details of the couples unstable relationship, believed to be an attempt by Lita's lawyers to tarnish Chaplin's reputation and gain a bigger settlement. Mr Morrish said: 'They met on set of one of his films and he seduced her as a young woman. It was frowned upon but he tried to make the most of the situation. 'When she became pregnant he wasn't particularly pleased to be trapped in a marriage. 'He squirrelled her away and did not report the birth until months later to make it look like the child was conceived after they wedded. The papers also contain an order stopping Chaplin from moving his wealth before the settlement so it would not affect the court proceedings . Lita was granted a $800,000 settlement when the couple eventually divorced in 1927 . 'She was quite a young woman when they divorced and she was being sent by her lawyers to get as much as they could. She has said she regretted it in later life. 'It was way above and beyond what is standard for divorce proceedings, even for now.' Eventually in 1927, Lita and Chaplin divorced and she was granted a settlement of $800,000, the largest at the time. Mr Morrish said: 'She achieved what her lawyers wanted. In the end she got what she wanted but he still had a fantastic career after that.'","Charlie Chaplin, 35,  married his second wife Lita Grey in 1924 .

"A Sydney anti-ageing doctor has been found guilty of medical misconduct after it was revealed she had been inappropriately prescribing drugs such as steroids and hormones to her patients. Dr Julie Epstein could also face being struck off after an investigation revealed she had been giving substances such as anabolic steroids to some 40 patients, some of whom had trouble with similar drugs in the past. The doctor, who opened one of NSW's first anti-ageing clinics, has been prosecuted by the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) for her conduct between August 2007 and August 2009, Fairfax Media reports. Sydney anti-ageing doctor Julie Epstein (not pictured) has been found guilty of medical misconduct . On Monday the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal found that Dr Epstein had been prescribing human growth hormone and other similar subtances 'without exercising responsible medical judgement'. The tribunal also revealed that some patients receiving these medications, such as bodybuilders and bouncers, had a history of abusing such substances. Other patients that visited Dr Epstein, who currently works at Atarmon on Sydney's north shore, were a woman with a history of mental illness and eating disorders, someone who was HIV positive, and another with warning signs of prostate cancer. The fact that the anti-ageing doctor failed to measure patients body weight or body mass index before prescribing dosages, and simply took patients' word on symptoms were also aired at the tribunal. The doctor is well known practitioner and has previously appeared in the media commenting on anti-ageing practices and similar areas. A tribunal found she was irresponsible diagnosing medications such as steroids and keeping inaccurate patient records . Dr Epstein also neglected to keep accurate or comprehensive records, and failed in communication with referring doctors. The five medications she prescribed were, according to Fairfax Media's report, anastrozole (Arimidex), human chorionic gonadotrophin, human growth hormone, nandrolone deconoate and testosterone. While the doctor prescribed drugs 'off-record', which means for a use other than their intended purpose, this in itself is not illegal. But the tribunal found that in conjuction with her other questionable practices, it was 'difficult to find the practitioner's off-label prescribing as conforming to acceptable medical practice'. Dr Epstein's barrister, Philip Greenwood SC asked the tribunal not to align his client's anti-ageing practice with that of conventional medicine. Mr Greenwood cited numerous medical studies which supported her actions, which were also supported by innovation in the industry. Dr Epstein has been a medical practitioner for 40 years and currently works in Artarmon on Sydney's north-short (pictured) However lawyers for the HCCC argued the case was not about the validity Dr Epstein's anti-ageing practices but her responsibility as a practitioner. The anti-ageing doctor had previously warned in 2007 about the prescription of steroids, and came to the attention of authorities again when a patient had the drugs seized when travelling overseas. Following these instances, restrictions were placed on her medical licence in 2009. During a hearing last year Dr Epstein said she had changed her procedures to include physical checks of her patients. She spoke about her four decade long medical history, and spoke about her interest in 'preventative medicine'. But the tribunal deemed her practice as 'naive', 'emotionally swayed', and in some cases 'placed her patients at risk'. A hearing set to be held in April will determine whether Dr Epstein's medical licence will be cancelled.","Dr Julie Epstein has been found guilty of medical misconduct .

The Ohio-based National School Safety and Security Services reviewed more than 800 school threats covered in the media during the first half of the 2014-15 academic year. Researchers found that about one-third of cases involved violent remarks sent anonymously via text message, social media, email or other online means. Law enforcement officers say the use of the modern technologies has made it much harder to determine if a threat is real and to find the culprit. Worrying trend: In this January 13, 2014 photo, students pass by Seven Lakes High School after being evacuated for the day after a bomb squad was called to remove a potentially explosive device . In many cases, swift action is taken with lockdowns and evacuations. However, authorities say the majority of the time  threats turn out to be hoaxes. Indeed, just this week a 16-year-old from Gateway High School in Kissimmee, Florida, was arrested for posting about a bomb threat on Twitter because 'she was angry and did not want to go to school,' according to the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. Complicating matters, the threats aren't just coming from within school walls or even a school's neighborhood. Last fall, Lakota Middle School in Federal Way, Washington, was placed in lockdown and police responded after an email purportedly from the Islamic State group demanded ransom money and threatened to 'shoot and kill' every American, according to a police report. A 14-year-old student was arrested after admitting the email had been sent by her online friend 'Ryan' after she told him to 'swat' her school because she thought it would be funny, police said. Anonymous: Law enforcement officers say the use of the modern technologies has made it that much harder to determine if a threat is real and to find the culprit (stock photo) 'Swatting' plays off the idea of issuing a threat that draws a SWAT team in response, disrupting activities at the target of the threat. It appears to have originated with pranksters in the online gaming community. In a separate case, a 14-year-old in western Michigan was ordered by a judge to pay nearly $8,000 in restitution to the Coopersville Area Public Schools and the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office for his involvement in a swatting incident that put schools in lockdown after a caller using computer-based technology made threats against the schools. Authorities say the call was made by a person code-named 'Ransom,' whom the teen had met online. 'Ransom' is believed to live in the UK and is suspected in a string of similar incidents from coast to coast, according to law enforcement. 'He will learn from this,' the teen's father said, according to the Grand Rapids Press in Michigan. The motivations of the threat makers vary, just as they did a generation ago when bomb threats were called in by pay phone: avoiding a test, revenge or simply to show off. With swatting, a motivation appears to be thrill-seeking, said Capt. Mark Bennett with the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office. It's not too difficult for students to figure out how to pull off such an incident, said Justin Cappos, a computer science professor at New York University who studies cybersecurity. 'You wander to the wrong parts of the Internet and you can learn how to do it and not get caught,' Cappos said. With each incident, there's a risk when authorities respond, said Detective Jerrad Ely, a digital forensics expert with the Mount Vernon Police Department in Washington who has been investigating a bomb threat case against a school in his community. 'They could inadvertently get hurt when police are just trying to do their jobs based on the best information that they have,' he said. Applications such as Burnbook, Afterschool, Yik Yak, Whisper and Kik also have been used by students to make threats anonymously. In Michigan, Superintendent Timothy Stein of the Flushing Community Schools wrote to parents in December informing them about a posting on Afterschool that said, 'Bringing a Gun to School.' The posting had been brought to the high school principal's attention by a text message; police quickly determined that it was not a credible threat. 'I encourage you to ask you child to stop using this app and remove it from their phone,' Stein said. Every threat has to be taken seriously even though in most cases the called-in danger is not real, said David Pennington, superintendent of schools in Ponca City, Oklahoma, and president of the AASA School Superintendents Association. Meanwhile, social media and other electronic means of communication are keeping parents informed about threats. Mindful of past school shootings, they are demanding that children be pulled out of school even as school and law enforcement officials investigate. 'The security of people has been greatly eroded in this country, as you know, just through awful things that have happened,' said Mark Davidson, deputy superintendent at the Federal Way Public Schools.","The Ohio-based National School Safety and Security Services reviewed more than 800 school threats covered in the media during the first half of the 2014-15 academic year .

"Desperate Chicago Cubs fans were forced to pee into plastic cups as lines for the bathroom at Wrigley Field stretched through the concourse and out into the stands on opening day. The bathroom debacle caused people to wait more than one hour to get to one of only two working bathrooms and according to those who were there, some were left with no choice but to relieve themselves while standing in line. Traumatized fans uploaded pictures to social media showing the intense queues and plastic glasses filled with urine, as the modernization of Wrigley Field reduced the famous stadium to a potential public health disaster. Scroll down for video . Busting: The line for the restroom can be seen snaking its way to the bathroom which is visible in the top left of the picture . Almost there: Disgruntled and disgusted fans uploaded pictures to social media revealing their trauma in getting to the bathroom . Indeed, the Cubs admitted as much on Sunday as thousands of the 35,000 fans in attendance struggled to get to the bathroom. 'Opening Day at Wrigley Field has always brought challenges with wait times and tonight was particularly extreme,' Cubs spokesman Julian Green said in a statement published after the Cubs had lost to the St. Louis Cardinals 3-0. Stinking the field and the stands out, the Cubs and Wrigley Field claimed the problem began when two bathrooms on the upper deck 'went down temporarily.' This came at a time when the stadium was 'already experiencing issues with long wait times.' Social media was flooded with complaints. Opening day: A general shot of Wrigley Field during batting practice prior to a game between the Chicago Cubs and the St. Louis Cardinals on Sunday night . 'I'm all for renovating, but I've now missed two innings trying to get into the bathroom,' said James Hillebrand in a tweet. While Cubs fan Russ Stubenruch said, 'The lines were obnoxiously long compared to what you would normally get.' One fan who identified herself as Libby, told Deadspin that the whole scene was a horror show. 'Yes, fans were peeing in cups tonight. They were peeing EVERYWHERE. I heard there were only two working bathrooms- I know the lines were horrific and I also know that some were shut down early on because toilets just wouldn't flush.' Cubs spokesman Julian Green said that 'with 35,000 fans showing up in the ballpark tonight, we were simply not prepared to handle guests during peak periods. We have high standards for service and we missed the mark tonight. 'We want to apologize to our fans for the inconvenience tonight,' he added. 'Moving forward we plan to supplement the existing restrooms with additional portable units and will continue to monitor wait times.'","Furious fans uploaded pictures to social media of huge lines for bathroom .

"Chip shop boss John Clarkson has created a new answer to the Creme Egg question of 'how do you eat yours?' - by turning the chocolate into a pie to serve with chips. Eschewing the savoury favourites of sausage and egg or mince pies, Mr Clarkson decided to wrap the Easter delicacies in pastry before they were battered and deep-fried. The result is his very own 'Pie-egg-ra' dish - Creme Egg oozing from the traditional pie casing which is then served with chips to more adventurous customers at a price of £2.75. Scroll down for video . The 'Pie-egg-ra' dish contains one and a half Cadbury's Creme Eggs and is served with a side of chips . John Clarkson in his chip shop Mr Eaters Fish and Chips in Preston, Lancashire . The 55-year-old fryer, says the savoury-sweet mix is a hit with customers, who have taken to dipping chips into the Creme Egg 'yolk' like traditional toast soldiers. The pie was created by blind-baking the casing as the egg would otherwise melt down, . Then one-and-a-half Creme Eggs were popped in as a filling. A lid is put on to seal the dish before the pie is battered and fried until golden, . And if the timings are expertly observed, the chocolate will just begin to soften in the middle. Mr Clarkson, who runs Mr Eaters Fish and Chips in Preston, Lancashire, said: 'I love Easter and I love Creme Eggs but I thought it would be fun to try and put my own spin on them. 'Everyone has heard of battered Mars Bars by now so I thought, ""what would be the next step up?"" Mr Clarkson rolls out the pie casing (left) before stuffing one and a half Creme Eggs into it (right) The pie is then covered with a lid and dipped in batter (left) before being quickly deep fried (right) 'Creme Eggs are just the right size and shape to be placed in a pie, so I thought 'why not?' 'It's a laugh and I always like seeing what I can conjure up next for customers that might be seen as a bit strange or unusual. If you're tired of battered sausage, you might just fancy a Crème Egg Pie.' His wife Corinne added: 'They actually taste delicious and I don't even like Crème Eggs!' The couple are no stranger to wacky food creations. Last year, they created the world's largest battered Ferrero Rocher which weighed a whopping 5kg and contained around 25,000 calories. Mr Clarkson says his  savoury-sweet mix is a hit with customers, who have taken to dipping chips into the Creme Egg yolk, much like traditional toast soldiers . And while this particularly sweet-savoury offering may seem odd to some, Mr Clarkson isn't the first to have added his own touch to Creme Eggs. The Creme Egg in a Scotch Egg . A family butcher in the Scottish borders has come up with a new way to eat the eggs - inside a Scotch egg. Greig Foston and Benjamin Webb say their snack contains 1,000 calories - and is best served warm so the chocolate melts with the chilli-flavoured pork. Foston's Fine Meats in the village of Duns, Berwickshire, Scotland, is now even planning to sell mini egg sausages to add to shop's Easter offering. For just £1.85 you too could could enjoy the Cadbury's Creme Egg surrounded by chilli flavoured sausage meat and covered in breadcrumbs. Butcher Greig Foston explained: 'We always try to think up something new and exciting for the time of year - we try to get our thinking caps on.' The 36-year-old continued: 'We came up with the sweet chilli in the sausage meat and the egg in the middle.' Cadbury's Creme Eggs, which were first sold in the UK as Fry's Creme Eggs in 1963 are one of the country's best-selling chocolates, despite only being sold between New Year's Day and Easter. They have often used the slogan 'how do you eat yours?' in adverts on and off since the 1980s with unusual methods being featured on TV advertisements.","John Clarkson's chocolate pie is covered in pastry before being battered .

"His face has appeared in sandwiches, on tree stumps and even a dog's ear. Now, on the eve of Easter, a shop assistant has spotted the image of Jesus Christ in a hot cross bun. Mother-of-two Lindsey Norman noticed the uncanny resemblance in a six pack of £1 buns she had purchased from her local Sainsbury's in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. Scroll down for video . Mother of two Lindsey Norman spotted the image of Jesus in the hot cross buns she bought from Sainsbury's . She said: 'I saw them and thought ""that looks just like a figure of Jesus with a sign of the cross on his shoulder"". 'It made me giggle to myself because it's coming up to Easter.' Ms Norman purchased the buns from the store and took them home for dinner that evening. She has since eaten all the buns in the packet. The shop assistant said it made me 'giggle' when she saw the uncanny resemblance with Easter coming up . This is not the first time the Saviour has been spotted in a peculiar sighting. Last week a California couple were shocked by the 'miraculous' appearance of Jesus on their pine dining table. Jaimie Beebe, 37, and her boyfriend Gary Ousdahl, 37, put the table on eBay with a $5,000 (£3,350) price tag - but it has yet to receive any bids. In the same week, hundreds of believers flocked to a hillside in the San Francisco area of Putumayo, Colombia, when a landslide revealed the face of Jesus. Police had to be called in to control the crowds as Christians from across the country descended on the hill to witness the 'miracle'. In January last year, stunned dog owner Rachel Evans, 25, was bathing her mini Yorkshire terrier Dave in the bathroom sink when she spotted the image of Jesus in his ear. And in October, John Cranfield, 24, who lives in Manchester, inserted a slice of wholemeal bread into the toaster and was baffled when it popped out with the face of Jesus Christ. Mr Cranfield, a Catholic, said he was sure it is a message from God, adding: ‘As a strong Christian I believe that this was no mistake, I believe that God himself had sent it to me to prove that he exists and that I should not give up my faith.’","Lindsey Norman purchased buns from Sainsbury's store in Peterborough .

"Doctors solved the mystery behind an Arkansas man's kidney failure after discovering he loved downing a gallon of iced tea every day. Medical professionals at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock ruled out several causes for a 56-year-old man's kidney problems before blaming the 16 cups of iced tea he drank daily. Black tea has high levels of oxalate, a chemical known to produce kidney stones and even lead to kidney failure if consumed in excessive doses. Scroll down for video . Toxic tea: Medical professionals at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock blamed a 56-year-old man's kidney problems on the 16 cups of iced tea he drank daily . 'It was the only reasonable explanation,' said Dr Umbar Ghaffar of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, who wrote about the patient in an article for the New England Journal of Medicine. The man was admitted to the hospital in May complaining of nausea, weakness, fatigue and body aches. The chemical oxalate was found to have clogged the man's kidneys, to the point that they had become inflamed. With a habit of drinking about 16 8-ounce cups of iced tea every day, the unidentified man was consuming anywhere from 3 to 10 times the amount an average American takes in. The 16-daily-cups habit was striking on its own, since federal studies have found that the average US adult drinks about 10 to 11 cups of liquid every day, including water, coffee and other beverages. Ghaffar said she didn't know whether the man was drinking sweet tea, a concoction made from black tea and a hefty serving of sugar that is popular in the South, though he was diabetic. The New England Journal of Medicine has cited black tea in health issues before, publishing a 2013 case that found a 47-year-old woman had developed a bone disease from drinking a pitcher of tea made from 100 to 150 bags of tea every day. The Arkansas man's case, however, does not suggest health risks for most people, according to Dr Randy Luciano, a Yale School of Medicine kidney specialist. 'I wouldn't tell people to stop drinking tea,' said Luciano, who has treated patients with oxalate-related kidney damage. That man drank 'a lot of tea.'","Doctors at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences found a 56-year-old man's kidney problems stemmed from drinking too much iced tea .

I’m so sorry. I don't know what happened."" He had as much emotion as the customer-service representative who tells you your bags missed the flight,' she penned. Giuliana ended up giving Jerry another shot. Following her heart: Giuliana claims Jerry cheated on her with Spice Girls singer Geri Halliwell, however she still took him back . Their romance turned serious when talks of marriage began, but that quickly changed when Jerry began chatting up Rebecca at Maxim's 100 Hottest Women party in 2004. 'Little did I know he was in the VIP area, talking up Rebecca. As a prelude to feeling up Rebecca,' she wrote. Following his encounter with Rebecca at the party, Jerry became unreachable, and Giuliana decided to talk to him face-to-face at his residence.

There, the actor flippantly dumped her: 'Nope. Sorry, homegirl...Things change, but you take care, OK?' While Giuliana's love life is now going strong with husband Bill Rancic, the actress has now found herself putting out another fire. Just a month earlier Giuliana stirred up controversy when she commented on Fashion Police that Zendaya smelled of 'patchouli oil' or 'weed' when she arrived to the Oscars with dreadlocks. Saying her piece: The E! star aired her side of the Fashion Police controversy in an interview with Today . Heartfelt: The TV star confessed 'I do not have an eating disorder' - nor has she ever - in her Today interview . On Monday, Giuliana - who looked fantastic with a bubble gum pink lace top that was paired with a high-waisted white peplum skirt - talked to the Today Show about Zendaya. 'I made a reference to the hippie culture. I talked about patchouli oil, which is a hippie perfume. And in the editing process, some of the gestures I made, some of the things I said were taken out for time,' the beauty said. 'I made peace signs, I said ""bohemian"" twice - those were taken out for time.' Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . 'So when the joke aired, some people were offended by it. I find racism reprehensible. I don't tolerate it at all. Nor have I ever.' 'I thought that the joke was not edited in a proper way. And that's just something I have to live with.' Also on the Today Show, Giuliana addressed the criticism she has received for her shrinking waistline. Love at last: The star has been married to The Apprentice winner Bill Rancic since 2007 - here the couple are pictured in October in Los Angeles . 'I do not have an eating disorder. I have never had an eating disorder. I wanted to be very clear about that. In fact, I eat a lot. People always love to tweet: ""Eat a burger."" I eat burgers. It's not working,' she told Savannah Guthrie. Giuliana, who had a double mastectomy after revealing she had breast cancer, added: 'But the main thing is I've lost a considerable amount of weight really in the past year or two due to the cancer medication that I'm on... I was eating more than I've ever eaten, but I was losing weight, and I was scared. I didn't think, this is great. I though, what the heck's happening to my body?' Giuliana - who announced last week she was moving to Chicago - has also suffered a personal blow in her efforts to add to her family. 'Everyone's been asking us about our last embryo because we would talk about it on our reality show. We had our final shot at having a baby, a biological child...and unfortunately she did miscarry. It didn't work out.' The star appeared optimistic when she added: 'But that's okay, there are other options. I've always been open to adoption, even before we had issues.

"Kellie Maloney has left hospital after completing her sex change and said: 'I am proud to be the woman I should've always been'. Transsexual Kellie, formerly boxing promoter Frank Maloney, started the process to change gender two years ago and underwent her final surgery last week. The twice-married 61-year-old was expected to stay in hospital for 10 days, but has been released four days early. She now faces  a further six weeks recuperation period at her home in Kent with children Sophie, 20, and Libby, 14, and may also go to Europe for some spring sunshine to help her heal. Scroll down for video . Recovery: Kellie Maloney had tweeted these pictures of herself after leaving hospital after her final sex change operation . Message: After her release from hospital Kellie sent this tweet on what was also international Transgender Day of Visibility . She was seen leaving the private Nuffield Heath hospital in Brighton - which was also the international Transgender Day of Visibility. She wrote on Instagram: 'I am proud of who I am on this transgender day of visibility. But more important I am just proud to be the woman and human being I should always been. 'I stand alongside my sisters asking the world to show us respected.' This morning she tweeted: 'First night at home not feeling to bad still very sore and got pain but in good health'. The gruelling transition process has included hormone therapy, electrolysis to remove excess body hair, counselling and voice coaching. She also underwent surgery in November last year to make her face appear more feminine - a process which went drastically wrong when she stopped breathing. The procedure left Ms Maloney, who has three children from two marriages, with a severely swollen face and the former promoter revealed that she thought her head would 'explode' after the agonising surgery. She had been due to have her final surgery in January but due to the previous complications it was delayed. As a boxing promoter she helped Lennox Lewis to become world heavyweight champion. Getting ready: Kellie Maloney went on a fitness regime before her sex change operation (pictured) and six days on from the procedure she has left hospital and is recovering at home . Her highly successful career, which spanned more than 30 years, saw her manage five boxers to world titles as well as many more British, European and Commonwealth champions. Before the final countdown to her last operation, Ms Maloney revealed she was hitting the gym hard to make sure she was in optimum health for the procedure. On March 14, she tweeted: 'One last week of hard gym sessions set myself A target of 4lbs to lose be4 going in to hospital and getting my bmi down by 2 per cent more.' Last year she shocked the macho world of boxing by announcing her decision to change her sex and live as a woman. Ahead of her surgery, Kellie told Lorraine Kelly that she wanted to have her nose made slightly smaller. 'My youngest daughter told me my nostrils were too big,' she said. I was always concerned about my chin but they tell me it's within the female parameters and the gender doctor can do the full operation, hopefully, and breasts in January.' Success: Her highly successful career, which spanned more than 30 years, saw her manage five boxers to world titles as well as many more British, European and Commonwealth champions . Kellie Maloney, pictured last year, completed her sex change with a final four-hour operation . She added: 'I am living really well now, I am pleased that the public are really good to me and my daughters are great. The operation will be the final piece of the jigsaw, then I can start living my life properly. 'Most of my friends are retiring but I am living life all over again.' Kellie is also sharing her story and supporting others within her support group, talking at events and helping other transgender people. She even revealed that she's toying with the idea of getting back into boxing to prove that women can do it too. 'At least it will stop me shopping,' she said.","Transsexual Kellie was formerly boxing promoter Frank Maloney, 61 .

Ivan Carlos, 22, and eighteen-year-old Brenda Avilez were sleeping in a trailer at the Lone Oak Mobile Home Park in Palmetto at around 2.30am Wednesday when the driver of the white Chevrolet SUV lost control of the vehicle and crashed through the Park's fence, killing the couple, police told The Bradenton Herald. Avilez was nine months pregnant at the time, the Herald reports, the fetus did not survive. Couple: Ivan Carlos, 22 (left), Brenda Avilez, 18 (right), and her unborn child were killed after a man crashed an SUV into the home where they slept early Wednesday .

"Women from around the world have been writing letters to convicted Australian serial killer Ivan Milat since he was locked up in a maximum security prison twenty years ago, a new book reveals. The Milat Letters, is a compilation of 94 notes from Milat to his eldest nephew Alistair Shipsey. Milat is serving seven consecutive life sentences for the murders of seven backpackers in  NSW between 1989 and 1992. In the letters, he tells Shipsey about his 'fair share' of 'sheilas', who write 'some frightening things' - and one woman who has even proposed. 'Every month someone new writes; the latest one was from Texas. She tells me she’s 25, white. I ought to ask her “why” as she only knows me from a website, and there’s nothing nice about me on it,' one of the letters reads. 'As you know there are a lot of wackos out there as well. A lot of them write to me at times. I tell you Al, there are some real crazy people out and about.' Scroll down for video . Ivan Milat butchered and buried the bodies of seven young people between 1989 and 1992 in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW . Ivan Milat, 70, was convicted of butchering seven young people between 1989 and 1992 and burying their bodies in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW. He has been locked up in Goulburn's Supermax jail for almost 20 years. Now, Shipsey, a 55-year-old former Rebels bikie gang member who has been banned from visiting Milat in prison, says he has released the book of his uncle's letters for 'those who want to read the facts.' 'I have done this purely to show how the system can vilify a person without giving them a fair trial or a chance to appeal to his convictions,' Shipsey says on his Milat Letter Facebook page. The book's blurb reads: ‘Innocent or guilty?' and Shipsey promises ‘you won’t be able to put it down’. ‘They say he had someone or others with him – but we will never know. He still denies his guilt in the brutal murders that were carried out in the Belanglo forest between 1989 and 1992. He has been inside for twenty years now,' the promo reads. The 55-year-old former Rebels bikie gang member has compiled the letters into a $32 book . Titled 'The Milat Letters', Shipsey (left) promises 'you won’t be able to put it down'. Ivan Milat (right) is currently serving seven life sentences . Some of Milat's letters detail his correspondence with women from the United States, Japan and Australia in the years he has been behind prison bars,  News.com.au reports. 'I get my share of women writing to me - some real good looking ones, too (if it’s their photographs they’re sending),' Milat wrote. 'For some reason, they all say they’re around 20 to 30 years old, though their writing suggests they’re much older. I’m very careful of my replies. I’m not real keen writing to the young ones.' One woman, who has written to Milat from the day he was charged in 1994, is Margaret, one of two women he was acquitted of raping at knife-point in 1971. During his trial, Milat's then-lawyer successfully argued that the girls were liars. 'I still hear from Margaret who is writing to me, though I think someone presses her button just to see what I say. This crazy sheila (in her 50s now) has been writing to me ever since my arrest and sending me weird photos. She is unbelievable,' Milat wrote. 'I get my share of women writing to me - some real good looking ones, too (if it’s their photographs they’re sending),' Milat wrote to his nephew Alistair Shipsey, who has released a book of his letters . In one letter, Milat, a former road worker, told his nephew he thinks  HenryVIII - who had two of his wives beheaded - 'had the right idea how to deal with women' In another letter, Milat tells his nephew he has also been propositioned. 'Why they write to me is a puzzle. I often get letters, even had some crazy f... from Mulewa prison writing to me (I used to write to her in the past - she was doing a few years and got out but it lasted about three months),' Milat wrote. 'She started writing again; in her last letter she asked me to marry her. I haven’t replied yet.' But Milat doesn't seem to be particularly enamoured by the writers of any of his love letters. In one note, he tells Shipsey he thinks HenryVIII - who had two of his wives beheaded - 'had the right idea how to deal with women'. Shipsey says Milat doesn't like talking about 'sexual things'. An extract from one of the letters from Milat, written before he chopped his own finger off with a plastic knife in January 2009, affectionately refers to Shipsey as 'Al . The first two bodies of Milat’s victims were discovered on September 19 and 20 1992, when two runners found a decaying corpse in the Belanglo State Forest. Police later confirmed the bodies were of missing British backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters. Walters had been stabbed 35 times and Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head. The grim finds were just the beginning of a long and extensive search which resulted in the bodies of Australians Deborah Everist and James Gibson being found in October 1993, followed by Simone Schmidl’s stabbed body in November of the same year. British backpacker Caroline Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head when police found her body . The decapitated body of German backpacker Anja Habschied was then found along with her boyfriend Gabor Neugebauer on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart. Milat was convicted of the seven backpacker murders on July 27, 1996 and for the attempted murder, false imprisonment and robbery of Paul Onions. He kept the shirts, sleeping bags, a water bottle, portable stove and backpacks of his victims hidden in roof and wall cavities, in what was described as an 'Aladdin's Cave', in the house he was arrested in 20 years ago. First victims: Australians James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both aged 19, were Ivan Milat's first known victims after they disappeared in December 1989 and their bodies were found in the Belanglo State forest almost four years later . Simone Schmidl's body was found in November 1993. She had been stabbed to death . Boyfriend and girlfriend German backpackers Gabor Neugebauer and Anja Habschied were found dead on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart . In prison, Milat has been a troublesome inmate, having planned at least one escape and swallowing metal objects so he could get out of jail. Other extracts from his letters, tell 'Al' why he chopped his own finger off with a plastic knife in prison in January 2009. ‘I will send them parts of my hand first, I have been considering this for a while and only need half a reason to show them how I feel with their sh**head ideas, there is not much they can do to me any more and at my age I don't give a f**k.' Milat tried to send his finger it in a padded envelope to the High Court. 'I do battle to cope with this sh***y claustrophobic place, no windows, it's like a cement coffin. I suffer badly at times, I think the walls close in, no air, it's a real sh*t feeling, no I will never plead with the p***s.' British backpacker Joanne Walters, is another one of the victims of backpacker murderer Ivan Milat . Sinister souvenir: In this photograph police seized from the house of Ivan Milat's brother William, the serial killer is seen carrying the sleeping bag which belonged to Deborah Everist who with boyfriend Jame Gibson was the first of Milat's victims killed in the Belanglo State Forest . Alistair Shipsey says the new book gives readers the chance to picture what a prison cell 'does to a man's mind over years.' 'This is in his words not someone making a story up, he didn't know I was ever going to do this so there's no lies in it, just facts,' Shipsey says. 'You can read the way he lives in supermax in his cement coffin.' On a Facebook page used to advertise the book, Shipsey makes his thoughts around his uncle’s imprisonment clear and blames the media for not reporting the real facts. He says no money from the $32 book’s sales will go to Milat because ‘he doesn’t need it where he is.’ Daily Mail Australia has contacted Shipsey for comment.

"CBS correspondent Lara Logan, who was brutally sexually assaulted while reporting in Egypt in 2011, is back home and recovering after she reportedly checked into a  DC hospital for at least the fourth time this year. She is said to be resting at her home in the Washington DC area but working on upcoming stories . A close family friend of Logan's, financial pundit Ed Butowsky,confirmed late last month that the 43-year-old had been hospitalized and revealed the extent of the journalism heavy hitter's suffering since the attack in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Scroll down for video . Lara Logan is back home and recovering after being hospitalized for the fourth time this year . Logan pictured shortly before she was sexually assaulted in Tahrir Square while she was reporting on the Egyptian protests in February 2011 . 'Very few people know how stoic and incredibly tough this lady is . . . No idea the physical suffering she has been enduring,' said Butowsky according to the New York Post. Butowsky previously  told Breitbart that Logan had been in and out of the hospital since the attack, which occurred while Logan was reporting on the Arab Spring. On February 11, 2011, Logan was the victim of a 'sustained and brutal' sexual assault as she reported from Cairo on the resignation of President Mubarak. She was surrounded by a mob of 200 - 300 men after being dragged away from her TV crew in Tahrir Square, seconds after Egyptian colleagues heard men talking about wanting to take her pants off. The group  tore her clothes from her body, groped and beat her, she later told The New York Times. 'For an extended period of time, they raped me with their hands,' the reporter said and she was subjected to 'aggressive pinching'. She was rescued by a group of women and up to 20 Egyptian soldiers. Logan has since returned to the Middle East. On Sunday, 60 Minutes aired her report on the persecution of Iraqi Christians by ISIS. 'She did the story while ISIS was just four to six miles from where she was reporting,' Butowsky said. 'She did the story over the last four to six months on location in the face of ISIS all while suffering from the brutal sexual assault she suffered at the hands of evil forces at play during the Arab Spring.' CBS told Breitbart in an email: 'We were sorry to hear this morning that Lara was readmitted to the hospital. We wish her a speedy recovery.' 'In spite of everything she’s had to face in the last two years, people have no idea the physical suffering she has been enduring due to the brutal sexual assault she encountered,' Logan's family friend Ed Butowsky (pictured left) said . A handful of weeks ago, CBS released a similar statement after Logan was admitted to hospital in late February, as she suffered internal bleeding reportedly from diverticulitis--a potentially stress-related intestinal condition. The foreign affairs correspondent has digestive diverticulitis, reported Page Six. The condition could have been aggravated by stress. She was expected to remain in the hospital for several days to recover. She had since been released at least long enough to complete her report on Iraqi Christians. Diverticulitis, according to the NIH website, occurs when when pouches, called diverticula, form in the colon and then become inflamed. The last few years have not been completely kind to the South Africa native. Aside from her beating and sexual assault in 2011, she was forced in 2011 to take a seven-month leave of absence after admitting her report on the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was based on a discredited first-hand account. And last year she was quarantined in South Africa after reporting from the Ebola hot zone in Liberia. Logan has been married to defense contractor Joseph Burkett since 2008. The couple have a son and daughter along with Burkett's daughter from a previous marriage, and live in DC. Lara Logan and her husband Joseph Burkett at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner in DC in 2011. The couple have been married since 2008 and have two children together . Diverticula are small, bulging pouches that can form in the lining of your digestive system. They are found most often in the lower part of the large intestine (colon). Diverticula are common, especially after age 40, and seldom cause problems. Sometimes, however, one or more of the pouches become inflamed or infected. That condition is known as diverticulitis. Diverticulitis can cause severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea and a marked change in your bowel habits. Mild diverticulitis can be treated with rest, changes in your diet and antibiotics. Severe or recurring diverticulitis may require surgery.","The reporter, 43, had been admitted to hospital for the fourth time this year relating to the sexual assault she suffered in 2011 .

Talking to the The Times, Cressida, Cressie to her friends, revealed that not only is she happily single, but that she's enjoying every minute of it. Though she still maintains a close friendship with Princess Eugenie, Cressida has broken free of the constraints that being part of the Royal Family could have put on her career. From a starring role in a six-week run of the play There's A Monster In The Lake, to dancing her way through Mulberry's new Spring/Summer 2015 ad campaign video, Cressie has cut loose. It's thought the pressures of becoming part of the Royal Family put a strain on Cressida's relationship with Harry. She has long dreamed of becoming an actress and wanted to pursue her career freely . Cressida has maintained a close relationship with friend Princess Eugenie despite the split . Calling herself a 'strong independent woman' and a 'lion' when it comes to protecting those that she loves, it seems we're all about to see a new version of the once quiet Cressida Bonas. 'I hope the focus is becoming more about the skills I have,' she said, referring to her time spent being known as little more than Harry's girl. The months leading up to her split from Harry last spring saw rumours hit fever pitch that the pair would imminently announce plans to marry. 'I hope the focus is becoming more about the skills I have,' said Cressida of the shift she hopes will happen in terms of how the media and public see her now that's she pursuing an acting career . Of the rumours surrounding both herself and Harry, Cressida said, 'all that stuff is not real. It's really important to remember that all it is is noise, noise that can be very loud at times' With a wedding thought to be on the way, the Duchess of Cambridge was even said to be helping shy Cressie learn how to handle to the intensity of the Royal spotlight. But the actress now dismisses all that as mere 'noise'. 'All that stuff is not real. It's really important to remember that all it is is noise, noise that can be very loud at times.'

"A small 'hot spot' in the U.S. Southwest is responsible for producing the largest concentration of the greenhouse gas methane seen over the United States - and is the subject of a major new investigation to find out why. The hot spot, near the Four Corners intersection of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, covers only about 2,500 square miles (6,500 square kilometers), or half the size of Connecticut. A recent Nasa map shows is produces more than triple the standard ground-based estimate - and researchers say they don't know why.. Scroll down for video . The Four Corners area (red) is the major U.S. hot spot for methane emissions in this map showing how much emissions varied from average background concentrations from 2003-2009 (dark colors are lower than average; lighter colors are higher). The hot spot, near the Four Corners intersection of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, covers only about 2,500 square miles. Methane is very efficient at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Like carbon dioxide, it contributes to global warming. To calculate the emissions rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air, the authors performed high-resolution regional simulations using a chemical transport model, which simulates how weather moves and changes airborne chemical compounds. Researchers from several institutions are now in the Four Corners region of the U.S. Southwest with a suite of airborne and ground-based instruments, aiming to uncover reasons for a mysterious methane 'hot spot' detected from space. 'With all the ground-based and airborne resources that the different groups are bringing to the region, we have the unique chance to unequivocally solve the Four Corners mystery,' said Christian Frankenberg, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, who is heading NASA's part of the effort. Other investigators are from the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in Boulder, Colorado; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Last fall, researchers including Frankenberg reported that a small region around the Four Corners intersection of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah had the highest concentration of methane over background levels of any part of the United States. An instrument on a European Space Agency satellite measuring greenhouse gases showed a persistent atmospheric hot spot in the area between 2003 and 2009. The amount of methane observed by the satellite was much higher than previously estimated. The satellite observations were not detailed enough to reveal the actual sources of the methane in the Four Corners. Likely candidates include venting from oil and gas activities, which are primarily coalbed methane exploration and extraction in this region; active coal mines; and natural gas seeps. Researchers from CIRES, NOAA's Earth Systems Research Laboratory and Michigan are conducting a field campaign called TOPDOWN (Twin Otter Projects Defining Oil Well and Natural gas emissions) 2015, bringing airborne and ground-based instruments to investigate possible sources of the methane hot spot. Shiprock, New Mexico, is in the Four Corners region where an atmospheric methane ""hot spot"" can be seen from space. Researchers are currently in the area, trying to uncover the reasons for the hot spot. The JPL team will join the effort on April 17 and fly two complementary remote sensing instruments on two Twin Otter research aircraft. The Next-Generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRISng), which observes spectra of reflected sunlight, flies at a higher altitude and will be used to map methane at fine resolution over the entire region. Using this information and ground measurements from the other research teams, the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) will fly over suspected methane sources, making additional, highly sensitive measurements of methane. Depending on its flight altitude, the NASA aircraft can image methane features with a spatial resolution better than three feet (one meter) square. In other words, it can create a mosaic showing how methane levels vary every few feet, enabling the identification of individual sources. Hotspot of total column methane anomalies centered over the Four Corners region from 2003 to 2009, when a satellite-based methane-measuring instrument was operational. The April study will focus on verifying the hotspot and determining the methane sources producing the exceptionally elevated methane concentrations. With the combined resources, the investigators hope to quantify the region's overall methane emissions and pinpoint contributions from different sources. They will track changes over the course of the month-long effort and study how meteorology transports emissions through the region. 'If we can verify the methane detected by the satellite and identify its sources, decision-makers will have critical information for any actions they are considering,' said CIRES scientist Gabrielle Pétron, one of the mission's investigators. Part of President Obama's recent Climate Action Plan calls for reductions in methane emissions. The research team also includes scientists from the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado, Boulder; the U.S. Bureau of Land Management; and the state of New Mexico. Is this the cause? The Four Corners coal-fired power plant, near Farmington, is one of the targets Nasa wants to investigate as a possible cause of the methane . In each of the seven years studied from 2003-2009, the area released about 0.59 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere. This is almost 3.5 times the estimate for the same area in the European Union's widely used Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. In the study published online today in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, researchers used observations made by the European Space Agency's Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) instrument, which measured greenhouse gases from 2002 to 2012. The atmospheric hot spot persisted throughout the study period. A ground station in the Total Carbon Column Observing Network, operated by the Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory, provided independent validation of the measurement. To calculate the emissions rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air, the authors performed high-resolution regional simulations using a chemical transport model, which simulates how weather moves and changes airborne chemical compounds. Research scientist Christian Frankenberg of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, first noticed the Four Corners signal years ago in SCIAMACHY data. 'We didn't focus on it because we weren't sure if it was a true signal or an instrument error,' Frankenberg said. The study's lead author, Eric Kort of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, noted the study period predates the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, near the hot spot. This indicates the methane emissions should not be attributed to fracking but instead to leaks in natural gas production and processing equipment in New Mexico's San Juan Basin, which is the most active coalbed methane production area in the country. Natural gas is 95-98 percent methane. Methane is colorless and odorless, making leaks hard to detect without scientific instruments. 'The results are indicative that emissions from established fossil fuel harvesting techniques are greater than inventoried,' Kort said. 'There's been so much attention on high-volume hydraulic fracturing, but we need to consider the industry as a whole.' In just one place in the United States do four states meet. The borders of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona intersect at Four Corners, west of the confluence of the Mancos and San Juan Rivers. Coalbed methane is gas that lines pores and cracks within coal. In underground coal mines, it is a deadly hazard that causes fatal explosions almost every year as it seeps out of the rock. After the U.S. energy crisis of the 1970s, techniques were invented to extract the methane from the coal and use it for fuel. By 2012, coalbed methane supplied about 8 percent of all natural gas in the United States. Frankenberg noted that the study demonstrates the unique role space-based measurements can play in monitoring greenhouse gases. 'Satellite data cannot be as accurate as ground-based estimates, but from space, there are no hiding places,' Frankenberg said. In March 2014 the Obama Administration announced a strategy to reduce methane emissions under its Climate Action Plan. The strategy includes improving the measurement and monitoring of methane emissions and assessing current methane emissions data.","Small 'hot spot' responsible for producing the largest concentration of the greenhouse gas methane seen over the United States .

"Employing cheap labour from Asia and having the length of working visas doubled are two ways of combating the childcare shortage in Australia authorities have said. Instead of employing European students on working holidays to act as au pairs industry experts want to attract more workers from Asia where wages are low. Extending au pairs on working holiday visas - who earn $250 a week as live-in nannies - to stay with one family for a year instead of the current six months is another option. The introduction of Asian nannies to Australia would go some way to help address the childcare shortage it's been argued . Compared with childcare rates of $100 a day or more, overseas nannies and au pairs can provide a cheaper and more flexible option for families with more than one child. The Daily Telegraph reports that Ross Taylor of the Indonesia Institute said provided protections were in place, opening up the au pair system to more workers from Indonesia could help deal with the crisis. ‘Indonesia has almost a million people working as au pairs around the world. Many are in countries that are not as safe and secure as Australia,’ he says. Labor Opposition Leader Bill Shorten says foreign nannies are not the solution for increasing problems with the childcare system . ‘Why not provide a ­serious opportunity for women for a safe environment where they can learn English and send money home?’ Around 10,000 au pairs travel to Australia each year. Parents and au pair agencies complain the six-month rule currently be used is unsettling for families and tough on children particularly those with autism and special needs. By working in Australia nannies from Indonesia and the Philippines can learn English and send money home . However, foreign nannies paid as little as $250 a week are not the answer to limited childcare and rising costs, federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten says. The Productivity Commission has suggested that extending the length of working visas for live-in nannies from overseas could help tackle the childcare shortage. Mr Shorten says that's not the way to solve the big challenges in childcare. Foreign nannies paid as little as $250 a week are not the answer to limited childcare, says Mr Shorten . 'I think what we need to do is make sure it's properly funded, that people can afford to pay it, that the fees aren't getting out of control and of course its good quality for our kids,' he told the Nine Network on Sunday. Social Services Minister Scott Morrison says the government will examine the Productivity Commission's recommendations.","Employing Asia nannies would help save money in the long run .

"John Knott shot his terminally ill wife Anne dead before turning the shotgun on himself after the couple apparently made a pact to die together . A retired managing director at the ‘end of his tether’ over his wife’s Alzheimer’s and plans for a traveller camp near their home shot her dead before killing himself, an inquest heard yesterday. Pensioners John and Elizabeth Knott lived in an ‘idyllic’ £500,000 retirement cottage in the village of Bosbury, near Ledbury in Herefordshire. But Mr Knott, 71, had been struggling to cope after his wife developed Alzheimer’s disease and a travelling family bought a plot of land next door. He had spent months battling plans for the traveller encampment on the land – which he feared would knock thousands off the value of his home – and kept a file ‘three inches thick’ on the planning proposals. On top of that, he faced the growing strain of caring for his 70-year-old wife, who was known as Anne. Last August the pressure got so much he shot her dead before turning the gun on himself, the inquest in Herefordshire was told. The Knotts had moved to picturesque Bosbury from Droitwich, Worcestershire, after Mr Knott’s retirement in 2006. They were both active members of local community groups including a rambling club. Mrs Knott helped put together the village newsletter and her husband had worked as a church warden. But in his final months, Mr Knott had been battling an application for planning permission to turn part of a paddock near to their 300-year-old cottage into a caravan park for travellers. It was to be the second traveller site within a small radius after plans were approved in 2012 for another camp on the other side of the Knotts’ property, separated from them by woodland. Two caravans and a day room were installed on that site. Mr Knott was said to be fighting plans to build a gipsy camp in a paddock (outlined in red) close to their 300-year-old cottage - the second traveller site proposed close to their home in two years . The retired company director was concerned the gipsy camp would affect the value of their £500,000 home . Herefordshire Coroners' Court heard that 71-year-old Mr Knott, pictured, had been devoted to his wife of 37 years, nursing and cleaning her as she struggled to cope with Alzheimer's . Detective Sergeant Tim Powell told the hearing the second camp was ‘clearly a concern’ to Mr Knott. He said: ‘He set about a very professional and comprehensive argument against this planning permission. It was to build a wash house, outhouses and three caravans.’ 2006 The couple move to Bosbury from Droitwich in Worcestershire following Mr Knott's retirement . 2012 Mrs Knott starts complaining of memory loss. In the same year, plans for a travellers' site near their £500,000 property are approved . 2013 Mrs Knott is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in January . 2014, February Mrs Knott's memory is rapidly deteriorating rapidly . 2014, May Application for proposed change of use of land from agriculture to a one family travellers site submitted to Herefordshire Council . 2014, August Mrs Knott spends four days at Latimer Court nursing home in Worcester before being taken home by her husband. The couple were found dead days later . Six weeks before his death, Mr Knott wrote a letter to council planners objecting to the proposals. It said: ‘There are at least eight settled (traveller) families within a one-mile radius of the proposed site. The area cannot sustain any more.’ Planning permission has now been granted, and diggers and construction vans were parked on the site yesterday – which has a ‘sold’ sign on display. One of Mr Knott’s neighbours said: ‘He was a nice bloke but he was really troubled by the gipsy thing going on. We noticed a big change in him when this started ... he felt very strongly about it.’ The family who applied for planning permission were well-known in the area, with several traveller sites. Friends said Mr Knott was worried that his home would plummet in value due to the camps, having been told by property experts they could knock up to £125,000 off the price. Since the couple died their cottage has been sold for £349,000, according to property website Rightmove. While fighting the plans, Mr Knott was also caring for his wife of 37 years as her Alzheimer’s worsened. Colin Westwood (left), brother-in-law of Mr Knott, was at the inquest at Hereford Coroners' Court today . She had reportedly begun hallucinating and suffering from paranoia and ‘irritability’. When she was eventually put into a nursing home for four days in August 2014, she ‘hated’ it, and anguished Mr Knott brought her home days before killing her. He had felt guilty about leaving her there, it was claimed. Friends said the couple were ‘lost’ without one another and it is believed they had made a pact to die together. Mr Knott, the former managing director of Ashford Construction in Birmingham, ‘worshipped’ his wife, the inquest heard. Close friend Elizabeth Keatley told the hearing: ‘He would do absolutely anything for her within his powers, and sometimes outside his powers. Mr Knott had written to the council expressing his concerns that the camp would go right past his home . ‘He was getting to the end of his tether. He said he lost his wife and she physically was not there. She was not mentally, emotionally there as well. He was lost without her.’ She said she went to visit the couple last July, adding: ‘John had lost a lot of weight and he was quite agitated. He had got too much to do, had too many things running through his head. I think he was not coping.’ Elizabeth Jane Conway, Mrs Knott’s daughter and Mr Knott’s step-daughter, described her mother’s downward spiral, saying: ‘She seemed to age very quickly ... at times she didn’t recognise her family.

"Laos is a popular tourist destination known for its beautiful scenery and ornate temples, however not many people venture below the surface and discover that what is underground is perhaps even more spectacular. The wondrous Tham Khoun Ex caves are so exquisite they don't look real at first, which is perhaps why locals believe that spirits inhabit the underground wonderland. Cave photographer, John Spies, 59, captured the sheer magnificence of the vast, yet intricate, underground wonderland. Enormous banks of terraced flowstone decorate the walls of the cave in many places. This slowly growing mound of white and orange calcite is one of the larger deposits along the river passage . Rippling reflections: A blue-tinted glow from outside illuminates the entrance chamber of the cave . Not your usual day out! Floating on clear deep water and reflections near the cave entrance, visitors can either bring their own kayaks or rent boats from the local community to paddle deep inside the cave and marvel at its wonders . Tham Khoun Ex caves, commonly known as Xe Bang Fai River caves, feature imposing stalagmitemade of mineral deposits. With over 15km (nine miles) of awe-inspiring passages and wide expanses of water, it really is one of Laos' hidden treasures. There is even a vibrant forest thriving at the upstream entrance to the caves, the lush green colour contrasting with the  enormous white and orange banks of terraces flowstone that decorates the walls. Visitors are able to kayak through the waters, or explore adjacent chambers on foot. The cave is only able to be safely accessed during the dry season from November to April and during this time the water is clear and deep with a rich green hue. For some of the grander shots, a team of four equipped with powerful LED lights and walkie-talkies helped to light-paint this enormous cavern for this long exposure shot. In 2008, an expedition, co-led by veteran caver John Pollack lead to the mysterious  caves being mapped and photographed for the first time. What the explorers discovered about the little-known cavern was a vast river cave, which means a cavern with an active water source flowing through it. 'Everything about the cave is big-from its towering entrances to its phobia-inducing spiders, which can be 10inches across,' Pollack told National Geographic. Nature at its best! The upstream inflow entrance of Tham Khoun Xe has a verdant forest inside a huge collapsed doline. It is possible to kayak from the resurgence to here and back in one full day . Hidden secrets! Massive formations abound in a newly discovered fossil section of the cave, 50 metres above the river level. This section, encrusted with delicate formations and not yet open to tourists, is one of several higher passages that lead to jungle shrouded entrances on . Gigantic! The Giant Gour in the Oxbow area of the cave is 60 metres long and is probably one of the worldís largest rimstone basins . American cave explorer Dave Pierce marvels at giant cave pearls which grow like pearls in an oyster with concentric layers of calcite slowly building up year after year . Lit up!

This gigantic section, is also not yet open to tourists, is one of several higher passages that lead to jungle shrouded entrances . The Giant Gour in the Oxbow area of the cave is 196 feet long and is probably one of the world's largest rimstone basins. The pool is filled with water during the wet season. The rims of basins like this grow taller each year as calcite precipitates from cave water as it flows faster over protrusions .

"It could have easily been passed off as an April Fool's Day joke, but for one couple winning the £53million EuroMillions jackpot was a reality. Richard and Angela Maxwell, from Coningsby in Lincolnshire, became 10th on the National Lottery rich list after they scooped £53,193,914 on the  draw on Tuesday. The couple, both 67, so far have only modest plans for what to do with the huge windfall - with Mr Maxwell planning to retire and play bowls. Scroll down for video . Richard and Angela Maxwell from Lincolnshire have become the 10th biggest British winners of Euromillions . Mrs Maxwell said she thought her husband was playing an April Fools' Day joke on her when he told her . The semi-retired consultant in the poultry industry said: 'I always keep our lottery tickets in the kitchen drawer so I took a break and went online to check the results. 'I looked first at the two Lucky Stars and noticed we had those. Then I scanned across to the first main number and immediately knew they all matched our numbers. I checked again and again, five times in total, as I couldn't believe it.' Mr Maxwell said he was in shock when he saw only one ticket had won £53million and believed someone had scanned his ticket and put it on the website as a joke. 'It was April Fool's Day after all,' he added. The father-of-two kept the win to himself for four more hours until wife Angela got home from helping to cook for a local OAP luncheon club. He said: 'I knew Angela would be busy and wouldn't answer her mobile phone so I waited til she got home. 'I kept myself busy making cups of tea for the builders because I couldn't sit still but didn't say anything to anyone.' When his wife came back carrying a basket of tea towels and asking about dinner plans, Mr Maxwell said: 'Angela, I've got something to tell you.' The shocked couple plan to take their family on holiday to New Zealand first class and buy a Land Rover . His wife said: 'I didn't know what to think. Richard just went red in the face and then said ""we've won £53 million"". 'I just said ""don't be stupid"" - he's always playing jokes so I thought it was an April's Fool. 'I just didn't believe it, then he showed me the numbers on the website and I dropped the basket of tea towels on the floor. I then just sat down in the chair for about half-an-hour stunned.' When the couple called their two daughters, Sharon, 45, and Paula, 44, they too thought it was an April Fool's joke. The couple are still thinking about what to do with the huge windfall but have already decided to upgrade a planned holiday to New Zealand - by taking the whole family first-class. They said they are also keen to help good causes and will donate some of the cash to their local community . Sports fan Mr Maxwell said he will now be able to retire completely to enjoy following Boston United and big sporting events, and play golf and bowls. Mr Maxwell is also going to treat himself to a Land Rover, while his wife plans to splash out on designer handbags and shoes. Mrs Maxwell said: 'Richard says he wants to travel round the world watching sport. I can go with him but I don't think I'll be watching any sport. It'll be retail therapy for me. 'As soon as we told the girls it started to dawn on us just how big an amount of money it is. 'It still hasn't sunk in. We don't know if we will make anyone millionaires but we will make sure our family is OK.' Mr Maxwell added: 'It's a life-changing amount of money - £1 million would have been amazing but £53 million enables you to do so much, not just for you, but those around you. 'Our local community is really important to us, in particular helping young people in the area. The win will enable us to spend more time getting involved, as well as give financial support.' Mr Maxwell said he survived prostate cancer eight years ago and is now in remission . He said: 'I had three operations and it was successful in the end. I was very ill for quite a while. That's why I retired from full-time work. He added: 'It made me realise that every day is a gift. We are not materialistic people. We don't crave things. 'We are simple people. Winning this amount of money would change anyone but we are going to try and stay grounded and live the way we've always done.' Mr Maxwell said his experience had inspired some of his fundraising and added that his motorcycling group has raised £50,000 for Macmillan nurses in the last three years. With their money they could buy 450 semi-detached houses in Lincolnshire or eight million tonnes of the county's famous sausages. The winning balls were 8, 20, 24, 28, 49 with lucky stars of 8 and 9. It comes in the same week that another couple - from neighbouring North Lincolnshire - beat odds of 283 billion to one to win £1 million in the EuroMillions lottery for a second time. Dave and Kathleen Long, from Scunthorpe, won their first £1 million in 2013 and scooped the big money prize again on Friday night. Mr Maxwell survived a prostate cancer diagnosis eight years ago and said he was glad to be here today . Colin and Chris Wear are Britain's current biggest winners after they won £161million in July 2011 . Mr Long said yesterday he 'just knew it would be my turn again some day' as the couple become the first people to win £1 million twice who have gone public. And the former lorry driver has not ruled out winning for a third time despite being perplexed at being labelled the luckiest man in Britain. The couple previously banked £1,000,000 in the EuroMillions Millionaire Raffle draw on Friday July 26, 2013, before they married. Despite their windfall, they decided to upgrade their prefabricated home - adding a conservatory and other improvements - rather than spend their cash on an upmarket house. Now they are looking for what they called today their 'dream home', although they still appeared to be thinking about a modest semi. The record for the biggest ever National Lottery win is held by husband and wife Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in Ayrshire. They said they had been 'tickled pink' after claiming £161,653,000 in July 2011 to rank among Europe's biggest lottery winners. Psychiatric nurse Mrs Weir and Mr Weir, who worked as a TV cameraman and studio manager for 23 years, reportedly bought a fleet of cars for friends since their win as well as a mansion with their EuroMillions winnings. They are followed on the rich list by Adrian and Gillian Bayford, from Haverhill, Suffolk, who won £148,656,000 in August 2012, and an anonymous ticket-holder who scooped £113,019,926 in October 2010. Adrian and Gillian Bayford are the UK's second biggest winners, pictured with cheque for £148million . The announcement came the day after David and Kathleen Long had their second six-figure win in two years . Scooping the jackpot: The UK's biggest Lottery winners . The National Lottery was set up in 1994 and since then it has made more than 3,700 new millionaires and changed the lives of thousands. Topping the list of winners is Colin and Chris Weir from Largs, North Ayrshire, who scooped a massive £161,653,000 in July 2011. The couple, who have been married for 30 years and have two children, shot above Ringo Starr and Sir Tom Jones in the Sunday Times Rich List after the win. Adrian and Gillian Bayford became the second richest lottery winners in August 2012 after scooping £148m . Gillian and Adrian Bayford, from Haverhill in Suffolk, are the second richest lottery winners after they won £148,656,000 in August 2012. But the music shop worker and his nursing assistant wife, who have two young children, soon split after their jackpot win and both now have new partners. Britain's third richest winner - who walked away with £113,019,926 - in October 2010 has decided to remain anonymous - much like sixth, seventh and eighth richest. Neil Trotter was living in a three-bedroom suburban semi in Surrey when he scooped £108million in March last year. Car mechanic Neil Trotter, pictured with his girlfriend Nicky Ottoway, won £108million in March last year . Dave and Angela Dawes' lottery ticket was worth £101,203,600 when they cashed it in October 2011. They have reportedly split after the win . The former car mechanic now has a £5million medieval mansion to call home, with its own private lake and more than 400 acres of land. In October 2011 Dave and Angela Dawes, from Wisbech in Cambridgeshire, won £101,203,600 and bought a £2million mansion in Surrey - but they have also reportedly split since the win.

"A married couple who each follow different religions came up with an unusual approach to raising their children - bringing up each of them in a separate faith. Diane Greenberg, a devout Catholic, and her husband Bob, who is Jewish, decided to split their family down the middle when it came to religion. Diane took charge of her daughter, Katie, 24; while Bob took the reins teaching Steven, 21, as they grew up in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Unusual set-up: Steven and Katie Greenberg, above, were raised in separate faiths - Steven Jewish and Katie Catholic . Katie had a confirmation, attended weekly Catholic instruction and remains a committed Christian to this day. Meanwhile Steven was circumcised when he was eight days old, and was given religious lessons in an Orthodox Hebrew school, NBC's Today Show reported. While Katie remains Christian today, Steven is now agnostic. Because his mother was not Jewish, his father was also unable to arrange a bar mitzvah for him, and admits he was less strict keeping up his religious education than Diane was with Katie. Diane revealed that their approach baffled many close to them. She said: 'I know people have looked at us like we were nuts. Together: Diane and Bob Greenberg, above with their children in a 2010 photograph, made the decision even though it baffles many . 'I didn’t really want to tell either one of our families for a long time what we were planning. We kept mum about it to most people but if we did tell friends, they all said we were crazy.' Nonetheless, the Greenberg clan think their unorthodox arrangement has its advantages. Katie said: 'I don’t know anybody else who did what my parents specifically did, but it was just never strange for me. '...We’d go to the Jewish side of my family [on Jewish holidays] and I definitely find comfort in Jewish traditions because I grew up with them, but there’s always been a “that’s not my religion"" thing.' She concluded: 'For me, this was just normal. It wasn’t something that ever struck me as odd. And my parents were very good about it. There was never any pressure from them. It was really just normal for us. I think it made sense for them so we went with it.'","Diane Greenberg is a Catholic and her husband, Bob, is Jewish .

"A newborn baby with a life-threatening liver condition has been saved after undergoing a transplant from her mother's twin sister. Star Reader was diagnosed with Biliary Atresia within days of being born in Barnsley, West Yorkshire. After undergoing an operation to have her bile ducts unblocked, her parents, Jade Reader and Matthew Bygrave, were told the infant would need a liver transplant in order to survive. Jade Reader (left) said she was 'overcome with emotion' when her twin sister Shanell (right) gave up part of her liver to save niece Star . With neither parent a suitable match, her maternal aunt Shanell Reader offered part of her organ, and has since saved her niece's life. Star's parents feared she was unwell after noticing her skin turning a yellowy tinge shortly after birth. While jaundice is common among babies, the colour did not leave her little body for weeks, prompting doctors to run tests on her liver. 'We didn’t think it was anything serious at first. Matthew had jaundice when he was a baby and he just had to go back into hospital and go under a lamp,' said Miss Reader, 24. Doctors discovered the baby's bile ducts were blocked, a condition that can prove fatal if untreated. Following an unsuccessful attempt to unclog them, a liver transplant was the family's only option. Within days of being born, Star's parents knew something was wrong when she her skin turned a yellowy tinge . While the baby's mother was not a suitable match, her twin sister proved an ideal candidate. They are pictured as children . 'We were utterly shocked when we were told what Star had. We had never thought it was anything like that. ‘When we knew that it could be life-threatening it was devastating. She was only a few weeks old and yet we may lose her,' said her mother. Biliary atresia affects about 1 in 16,000 babies at birth. In this condition, bile ducts are either blocked or absent. The cause of the condition is not clear and may vary. One of the most common early symptoms is jaundice (a yellow appearance of the skin or whites of the eyes) and pale stools. If untreated the condition can lead to liver failure and death. The most common treatments for Biliary Atresia is the Kasai procedure (surgery that allows bile to drain directly into the bowel). Both parents volunteered for the surgery but were told neither was a good enough candidate for a partial liver transplant. Miss Reader's twin sister Shanell was tested and told that she would give the baby the best chance of survival. 'She said without any hesitation that she would do it and that Star could have a piece of her liver. 'I was so overcome with emotion. She's my twin sister and if it was the other way round, I'd have done it to save her daughter too,' added Miss Reader. Star underwent the operation in November and, after spending six weeks in hospital. returned home where she has since made a good recovery. ‘Star has to have blood tests and liver function tests every week and she will be on anti rejection medication for the rest of her life. ‘But now she has been given the chance to live a normal life - and it’s all thanks to my twin sister. I can’t thank her enough,' her other added. Speaking of the decision, Shanell said: 'I didn’t hesitate to step forward to save Star. She’s my niece and I would do anything to help her.’ Since the operation in November baby Star has made a good recovery as has her aunt Shanell who said she did not hesitate when confronted with the choice of giving up part of her liver .","Star Reader was diagnosed with Biliary Atresia within days of being born .

"Prince Andrew will not face court action in the US over claims he had sex with an under-age girl, after a Florida judge ruled her claims must be struck out. Virginia Roberts had hoped to join a lawsuit involving Andrew’s friend Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted paedophile and sex offender. But last night Judge Kenneth Marra ordered her claims that she was a ‘sex slave’ to Epstein and was forced to have sex with the Duke of York three times should be ‘struck from the record’. Scroll down for video . Virginia Roberts photographed with Prince Andrew in early 2001. Her claims she was forced to sleep with him have now been struck from the court record . Prince Andrew pictured leaving an Easter service at Windsor Castle on Sunday. The judge ruled the details of the accusations against him had no bearing on the reopening of the lawsuit against Epstein . The judge refused to make a statement regarding the veracity of Miss Roberts’s allegations, but issued an order that the ‘lurid’ and ‘unnecessary’ claims should not be involved in the Epstein case. ‘At this juncture in the proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary,’ he wrote. ‘These unnecessary details shall be stricken.’ Prince Andrew is not mentioned by name in the ten-page ruling, made in the Palm Beach County court, Florida. But Judge Marra refers to the powerful people Miss Roberts was allegedly forced to have sex with by Epstein. Her claims of taking part in an orgy with the Duke and sleeping with him on two other occasions when she was 17 – below the age of consent in Florida – were described as ‘immaterial and impertinent’. In 17 words, the judge may have drawn a line under a controversy that has dogged Prince Andrew since January. Miss Roberts, referred to as ‘Jane Doe 3’ in court papers, and another woman were hoping to join two other alleged victims of Epstein in suing the U.S. government over a plea deal prosecutors struck with the financier. Jeffrey Epstein allegedly kept Virginia Roberts as a 'sex slave' But Judge Marra ruled yesterday that the Jane Doe 3 and 4 applications should be denied and it was therefore ‘unnecessary’ for them to be added as plaintiffs. When the court claim surfaced earlier this year, Prince Andrew and Buckingham Palace refused to go into any details regarding the accusations. However, in late January he briefly referred to the allegations at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, saying he wanted to ‘reiterate and reaffirm’ palace statements that insisted he never had any sexual contact or relationship with Miss Roberts. She has repeatedly claimed she had sex three times with Andrew when she was 17 – a claim he emphatically denies – and served papers on him via the British Embassy in Washington DC. But they were returned to sender. Her legal team’s bid to serve papers on the Duke came after courier FedEx returned a similar letter as it was ‘refused’ by the recipient at Buckingham Palace. The court papers lodged in Florida accused Andrew of abusing Miss Roberts when she was 17. She claimed that under the orders of paedophile Epstein she was ‘forced’ to have sex with the prince three times in 2001 – in London, New York and on Epstein’s Caribbean island. The 55-year-old royal was so concerned about the allegations that he consulted top criminal QC William Clegg. Andrew’s long friendship with Epstein was said to include lavish parties and exotic holidays, but it raised questions over the prince’s choice of friends. He was introduced to the billionaire by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of disgraced media tycoon Robert Maxwell. The fifth in line to the throne was forced to effectively cool, but not end, the friendship when sex claims were made against the financier. In June 2008, Epstein began serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to soliciting a girl, 14, for prostitution. Andrew was summoned by the Queen after pictures emerged of him in New York with Epstein in February 2011, after the financier had been released from prison. It emerged Epstein had given Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson £15,000 to help reduce her debts. Last night Buckingham Palace declined to comment. The Duke was not a party to the court action and was not given the opportunity to rebut the allegations through the court.

"A power outage temporarily blackened Washington, D.C. this afternoon, interrupting a State Department briefing and forcing the White House onto back-up generators. Traffic lights also went out in parts of the city. The chief spokesman for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue confirmed that the outage 'briefly had an impact on the White House complex' but it was 'back on the regular power source' by the time he began his briefing approximately an hour and a half later. 'Things are slowly but surely returning to normal at the White House complex,' Josh Earnest, White House press secretary, said, noting that he was in the Oval Office with the president when it happened, and it was barely noticeable. Scroll down for videos . District of Columbia Metro Police and U.S. Secret Service Uniform Division officers clear Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House. The temporary power outage affected the State Department, the Department of Energy, the University of Maryland in College Park and other areas in the District of Columbia and Maryland . With traffic lights still out at a busy intersection not far from the White House, a Metro Police Department officer directs vehicles after an electrical blackout affected the city . Several Smithsonian museums were affected as well, including the Portrait Gallery, and guests were evacuated . The impact on the White House was 'minimal,' he said, but was unable to say how many offices in the West Wing were affected. The source of outage was not immediately known, but the Department of Homeland Security has said there's no evidence of malicious intent or terrorism related activity. A possible cause was an explosion at a power at a plant located in southern Maryland, according to the Associated Press. Power company Pepco told local news station WTOP that a dip in power in the transmission line at one of its Maryland stations was responsible. As of a 1:35 pm update, more than Washington-area customers - including government offices - had reported outages, Pepco said. Visitors wait for the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum to re-open after it was evacuated following a power failure . A security guard announces the museum's closure to prospective visitors . The outage lasted but a few seconds at the White House, as the government building immediately moved onto generators. Press Secretary Josh Earnest's regular briefing with reporters was pushed off schedule by more than an hour. An unrelated matter, said by the White House to be an 'unattended package,' forced the building into a temporary lock down, adding to delays. Other government agencies, including the State Department, were affected for longer periods of time than 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The State Department's acting spokeswoman Marie Harf was in the middle of her daily briefing when the blackout hit. She lit the room with her cell phone, photos posted to Twitter show, and ultimately had to cut it short. Oprah Winfrey also got caught up in the power outage while speaking at the Maya Angelou Forever Stamp Dedication at Warner Theatre in downtown D.C. The U.S. Capitol, the Justice Department, IRS, Department of Energy and several Smithsonian museums, as well as the city's metro system were also affected, according to reports. Both the National Air and Space Museum and the National Portrait Gallery were evacuated as a result. Some stations of the city's metro system were running on emergency lighting, CNBC reported, and the Capitol complex's power system also failed over to a generator. Oprah Winfrey was in the middle of a speech at a dedication ceremony for the Maya Angelou Forever Stamp when the lights went out on her at Warner Theater in downtown D.C. The power failure extended as far northeast of Washington as the University of Maryland's flagship location in College Park, located roughly 10 miles outside the heart of D.C.

"Jeffrey Williams, 20, is accused of shooting and wounding the officers on during a rally on March 12 . The man accused of shooting two police officers during a demonstration in Ferguson has confessed to the crime in a series of phone calls from jail that were recorded. Jeffrey Williams, 20, is accused of shooting and wounding the officers on March 12, during an early-morning rally sparked by the resignation of Ferguson's police chief. All inmates are informed their phone conversations while behind bars are recorded and can be used as evidence against them, but despite the warning Williams spoke freely about the incident in calls made from the St. Louis County Justice Center. In a conversation with his girlfriend, Williams said he was being harassed by a group of people outside Ferguson PD on the night of the shooting . 'Nobody aiming at no police,' Williams said. 'I ran up the hill and he (an unidentified person) shot at the car. ... I shot back,' Williams said in the recordings first obtained by KMOV-TV. In another conversation, Williams expressed concern about a possible lengthy prison sentence. 'Even though I was in the wrong, though, I should have just went the other way,' he said. 'Oh man, now I'm looking at 10 years.' Prosecutors say Williams told investigators he fired a gun but was aiming at someone else. Williams' attorney, Jerryl Christmas, has said Williams told him he never fired during the protest. Despite being warned that phone calls from prison can be used as evidence, Jeffrey Williams, 20, spoke freely about the March 12 incident in calls made from the St. Louis County Justice Center . Christmas told The Associated Press on Wednesday morning he hadn't heard the audio of the phone conversations, but he stood by what Williams told him. 'My client has maintained to me that he never fired a gun that night,' Christmas said. 'So until I'm able to see evidence that I can distinctly talk to him about, I have to maintain my commitment to the statements that he has made to me.' Christmas was also critical of the justice center for releasing audio that provides potential evidence against Williams. Ferguson has been a focal point since a white police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, on Aug. 9. A grand jury in November declined to indict the former officer, Darren Wilson, who also was cleared of civil rights violations by the U.S. Department of Justice in March. Williams said he was being harassed by a group of people outside Ferguson PD and wasn't aiming at the cops. He also expressed remorse . Williams' attorney, Jerryl Christmas, has said Williams told him he never fired during the protest . But a separate DOJ report found widespread racial bias in Ferguson's policing efforts and the municipal court system, which it said was driven by profit mostly extracted from black and low-income residents. Several city officials were fired or resigned following the report. Among those was Police Chief Tom Jackson, and his resignation led several dozen people to protest outside of police headquarters. The demonstration was about to break up when shots rang out. A St. Louis County officer was shot in the shoulder; a Webster Groves officer was hit in the face. Both are expected to fully recover.","Jeffrey Williams, 20, is accused of shooting and wounding the officers on during a rally on March 12 .

Mr Hornby last night faced calls to step down from his role as non-executive chairman of Pharmacy 2U and was condemned for profiting from the sale of his customers’ personal data. Many of those whose details he is selling on are some of the most vulnerable in society – either too ill to travel to their nearest surgery or the disabled. Others who use the NHS-approved pharmacy website used its online doctor consultations. Their details – which included email addresses and dates of birth – were passed on without proper consent. When Mr Hornby joined the company, the UK’s leading online pharmacy, in 2012, it said in a statement: ‘The imminent transition to electronic prescriptions across the NHS represents an exciting opportunity for Pharmacy 2U, and Andy’s insights and leadership will be of significant value.’ It is not known how much Mr Hornby – who works two to three days a week – is earning from the Leeds-based company, but it is thought he received a significant salary increase last year. He is also a principle shareholder. Dr Sarah Wollaston, the outgoing Tory chairman of the Commons health select committee, last night called for Mr Hornby to step down and for a criminal investigation into Pharmacy 2U. She said: ‘He should be called to account for what his company is doing and issue a public statement. He needs to be made to sit down and explain why patient information is being sold on.’ She added that the health select committee should launch an inquiry into the issue after the election. Pharmacy 2U, an online prescription service, sold details including the patients’ email addresses, dates of birth and date of their last prescriptions to marketing firms . Many of those whose details he is selling on are some of the most vulnerable in society – either too ill to travel to their nearest surgery or the disabled . Following the financial crash in the autumn of 2008, a devastating report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards accused Mr Hornby and fellow former bosses of ‘catastrophic failures’ as they presided over years of reckless lending. His current role is his third job since then. In 2011 he unexpectedly quit as £1million-a-year chief executive of healthcare group Alliance Boots, a move blamed on stress. Dr Sarah Wollaston, the outgoing Tory chairman of the Commons health select committee, called for Mr Hornby to step down . Four months later he became boss of Coral, a position he still holds. In 2013, he faced calls to quit amid reports the bookmaker was set for a £2billion flotation. Pharmacy 2U admitted that it had sold the names and addresses of ‘up to 5,000’ patients to data company Alchemy Direct but refused to say how much it had charged. It said it had decided to stop selling the information to Alchemy and stressed no medical data had been passed on. Last night Pharmacy 2U said that Mr Hornby is ‘not involved in day-to-day decisions about the running of the business’. A spokesman added: ‘We have asked the Information Commissioner’s Office to work with us to review our privacy policy and have also contacted the General Pharmaceutical Council, our industry regulator, and the NHS, to discuss this matter.’ NHS England said: ‘Any breach of confidentiality is totally unacceptable. This case will be reported to the Information Commissioner and General Pharmaceutical Council and there will be an immediate investigation.’","Andy Hornby is in charge of the disgraced online company Pharmacy 2U .

"The picture of a 101-year-old Arizona woman cradling her new-born great-granddaughter spanned four generations of the same the family in one photograph and captured the hearts of millions. Posted to Facebook two weeks ago, the loving image of Rosa Camfield and baby Kaylee became an online sensation before it was announced that Rosa had sadly passed away on Monday. But behind every picture is a story and Rosa's is every bit as inspirational as the photograph that captivated the Internet. Speaking to Daily Mail Online, Rosa's granddaughter, Sarah Hamm, 33, detailed her grandmother's life from tumultuous youth in the Depression era, to a difficult divorce in the 1950s and all the way to her third marriage - to her childhood sweetheart - in her 80s. 'Grandma was always happy, I mean, she was smart as a whip, even at 101,' said Hamm. 'She was funny and had lots of stories.' Scroll down for video . Four generations of the same family: Rosa Camfield was born in June of 1913 and died Monday. Since this picture appeared on the popular Facebook page Life of Dad, she received millions of likes and comments from around the world . Hamm originally posted the photo a week before her grandmother's death after taking her daughter, then 2-week-old Kaylee, to meet her great-grandmother Rosa for the first time. Rosa had three children, five grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. 'It was actually the day she was being released in the hospital, so we were hoping that Grandma would get to meet her,' Hamm said. Soon after she snapped the photo, it ended up on Life of Dad where it became a massive hit. 'When I posted it I thought a few of our fans would feel connected to it as I did. Then, within an hour, it was clear that I had underestimated the impact it would have with people as it was shared and liked hundreds of times per minute,' said Life of Dad founder Patrick Quinn. As of Wednesday afternoon, the photo had received over 2.5 million likes and nearly 78,000 shares. 'I think its really sweet,' Hamm told ABC. 'My grandma would've loved this.' Like the few who make it to live past 100, Rosa Camfield had a lifetime worth of stories that her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren remember well. As a young woman: Rosa Camfield pictured above on her graduation from high school in 1931 . Rosa's youngest daughter Lynn Vine, says her mother was born on a fruit farm in Michigan in 1913. Rosa's family appears to have been relatively well off before and during the Great Depression. Her father was the first one in their town to have both a radio and a car, using it to bring locals to their home for nightly entertainment. 'Grandpa was the one who liked to have new things and he was quite progressive so they always had the first of everything,' Vine remembers. Vine says her mother lived in a time when kids still attended school in a one-room schoolhouse where children of all ages were taught by the same teacher. 'One year she was the only kindergartener the class,' Vine said. While Rosa wanted to go to college after school, her dad advised her not to. 'Her dad didn't want her to go to college,' Vine says. 'He said, ""You don't need to. We have plenty of money.""' Rosa went on to marry her first of three husbands in the mid-1930s, a man named Rubin with whom she had all of her three children. Rosa pictured above with her three children, who she had with her first husband. From left to right: Lee Miles, Rosa Camfield, Raymond Wheaton and Lynn Vine . Rosa is pictured on her 98th birthday three years ago, surrounded by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren . Rosa and her 5-year-old great-granddaughter Mackenzie snuggle on her bed last month . Rosa Camfield started off as a farm girl, stayed at home to raise her three children and eventually got her teaching degree to work with 8th graders . While the couple were married, World War II broke out and the couple helped out by spotting planes. Unfortunately the marriage didn't last, and the couple divorced after about 15 years. It was after her divorce that Rosa decided to go back to college - while raising her three children in her 40s - and get her degree in teaching. She taught 8th Grade at Ludington Public Schools for most of her career - and one year her daughter Vine had her as a teacher. Rosa married twice more. Her second husband, Mert, died in the mid-1980s and she married for a third time, to her childhood best friend, Lennis Camfield, a few years later. Rosa and Lennis grew up next door neighbors and they would walk the same half-mile route to school everyday. Vine says her mother would always talk about walking to school in the winter, when she followed behind 7-years-old older Lennis to escape the snow  since the road wasn't plowed. Vine says it was obvious that Lennis was the love of her mother's life - despite the fact the two married in their 80s and only had a small amount of time together (Mr Camfield died in 1996). 'She was really heartbroken when he died...I know she wished she had longer time with him,' Vine said. Recently, Rosa had been living with one of her daughters. In November she was diagnosed with breast cancer, but remained active even in her final days - continuing to crochet and knit until about two weeks ago. 'Her opinion was if you're bummed out or whatever - get over it,' Vine remembers of her mother. 'Put a smile on your face, and things will be better the next day.' After Hamm posted the photo online, hundreds of people shared similar pictures. This image shows Ohio mom Amanda Garber's son, Samuel, with his great-great-grandmother, Helen Willaman - a 101-year difference . According to this submission from Pennsylvania, the age difference here is 93 years . One image shows Ohio mom Amanda Garber's son, Samuel, with his great-great-grandmother, Helen Willaman. 'My son and grandma are almost 101 years apart. I feel extremely blessed to have her in our lives,' Ms Garber told Today. 'I love to hear the stories of when she was a little girl, or when she had a baby and how different it was back then.' Meanwhile Washington-based mom Breean Ferreira shared an image of her 113-year-old great grandmother and her one-year-old son - a family with five living generations. Grandmother Laura Kayizzi posted a photo of her own grandmother, who was born in 1915 and passed away this winter. Ms Kayizzi's image shows her daughter’s son being held by his great-great-grandmother, revealing that 'her advice to my daughter about being a mom was, ""Love them as much as you can. They grow up fast.""' Candice Joynt, from Colorado, posted this image with the caption: '101 years, 4 months and 12 days apart' Jennifer Browder Goodman from South Carolina submitted this image of her grandmother holding her daughter for the first time 'She will be 95 in August!' she wrote .

"Cosmetic surgeon Dr Fredric Brandt hanged himself on Sunday at his Miami mansion. Miami Herald columnist Lesley Abravanel told Daily Mail Online exclusively that sources close to Dr Brandt said he had hanged himself. The City of Miami Police Department confirmed that Dr Brandt's death was a suicide by hanging on Monday. Abravanel said Brandt, 65, was  'devastated' recently over rumors comparing him to a character on the Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Scroll down for videos . Dr Fredric Brandt (left) has a striking resemblance to Dr Franff (right), a character on Tina Fey's Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He was reportedly 'devastated' by the portrayal. Columnist Lesley Abravanel told Daily Mail Online exclusively that sources close to Dr Brandt said he had hanged himself at his home . Dr Fredric Brandt was last pictured on November 17, 2014 alongside life coach Tony Robbins and wife Sage Robbins (right) at a magazine party in New York City .

Dr Brandt, a cosmetic dermatologist and well-known art collector, at his apartment in New York on March 7, 2014 . Dr Brandt, who was known for working with stars including Madonna, Kelly Ripa and Stephanie Seymour, died after ‘suffering from an illness,’ his publicist said. Ripa's husband, actor Mark Consuelos, retweeted choreographer Isaac Calpito's post, which read: 'Devastated over the loss of our dear friend @drfredricbrandt. You are missed. You are loved. The world has lost one of its kindest souls.' Publicist Jacquie Tractenberg did not reveal information about the illness, cause of death or the circumstances of the death. Ms Abravanel, a Miami Herald columnist, posted a series of tweets on Sunday claiming that he had been 'devastated' by unflattering comparisons to Dr Franff on the hit show Kimmy Schmidt, according to unnamed sources. She also reported that he was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami by his housekeeper where he lived alone. She called 911 at 9.19am. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department confirmed that an autopsy will be conducted on Monday. Abravanel pointed out that the cosmetic surgeon character, played by Martin Short, has a striking resemblance to Dr Brandt. The New York Post also wrote a column last month comparing the real-life doctor to the fictional doctor on Tina Fey's hit comedy. 'Sources: Dr Fredric Brandt was ""devastated"" over comparisons to the protagonist on Tina Fey’s new Netflix show, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"",' Abravanel tweeted.

She then posted a tweet which read: 'Dr. Brandt's publicist says he was suffering from an ""illness"". Sources close say that illness was depression.' Dr Franff only appears in one episode, titled 'Kimmy Goes To The Doctor!', of the first season. The character shares Dr Brandt’s smooth skin, platinum blond hair and enthusiasm for plastic surgery, but his door sign claims he’s a ‘board certified D, DS, DDSOBGYN’, rather than a cosmetic dermatologist. The Dr Franff character is depicted on the Netflix show with a high-pitched laugh and unable to speak certain words due to his plastic surgery. He is also seen drinking  from a surgical bag and reinflates his own face after being punched. Netflix had no comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online. Tractenberg, the publicist, said that everyone who knew the famed dermatologist 'is devastated'. 'I worked with him for over 20 years and he was an amazing man, not only what he a brilliant doctor, but he was the kindest human being,’ she told the New York Post. Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques. In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones. Though Abravanel suggests that Dr Franff is a protagonist on the show, Martin Short's character only appeared in one episode of the first season . The Miami-based columnist later suggested on Twitter that the cosmetic surgeon was suffering from depression before his death . It was also widely known that Dr Brandt injected products including Botox, Restylane, Perlane, Juvéderm, Voluma The Times reported, into his own face, erasing his wrinkles, leaving him with full lips and an ageless quality. The doctor told The Times that people often asked him if he was from Sweden. Representatives for Dr Brandt and Fey did not immediately return requests for comment from Daily Mail Online. Dr Brandt grew up in Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey where his parents ran a candy store. Security was tight in the gated entrance to Dr Brandt's  Miami home on Sunday. His publicist declined to comment on the circumstances or cause of death . Dr Brandt had famed practices (pictured) in Miami and Manhattan. In a 2014 profile, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony' His father died when he was a teenager and he lost his mother before he graduated from Rutgers University in 1971. He went on to attend Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia. He completed residencies at NYU's Department of Internal Medicine and then in Dermatology at the University of Miami. He set up a practice in Coral Cables, Miami in 1982 and began part-time work in New York in 1998 but quickly expanded to become one of the most in-demand cosmetic appointments. He would sometimes see around 30 patients a day at his midtown Manhattan offices, which is filled with expensive art works, for appointments costing thousands of dollars. The 65-year-old was considered as the number one injector of Botox and Restylane filler in the world. The doctor was regarded by his peers as a pioneer in the field and often gave lectures on the use of products. Dr Brandt also has a range of high-end dermatological products. A 1.35 oz 'Do Not Age with Dr. Brandt' Transforming Pearl Serum costs $150. He wrote two books about his work, '10 Minutes/10 Years: Your Definitive Guide to a Beautiful and Youthful Appearance' and 'Age-less: The Definitive Guide to Botox, Collagen, Lasers, Peels, and Other Solutions for Flawless Skin'. Along with his Miami mansion, Dr Brandt had a luxury apartment on the West Side of Manhattan with sweeping views of the Hudson River and filled with the esteemed art collection. Tributes poured in for Dr Brandt following the news of shocking death. TV presenter and beauty editor Nadine Baggott wrote: 'RIP Frederic Brandt - I loved every fascinating minute spent interviewing him.' @idrisjoel postd on Twitter: #RIP to one of the kindest and most brilliant physician I've ever met, Dr Frederic Shelton Brandt.' TV Host Jeannette Kaplun ‏wrote: 'So sad that the world has lost a wonderful, kind and brilliant human being, Dr. Frederic Brandt' Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy. Franff's platinum blond hair and tight skin have a stark resemblance to that of cosmetic dermatologist Fredric Brandt .","Cosmetic dermatologist to the stars Fredric Brandt died at his Coconut Grove home in Miami on Sunday, aged 65 .

"These adorable abandoned badger cubs have been nursed back to health by a kind-hearted animal lover on a diet of custard creams. The orphaned youngsters - one of which escaped death after being carried away in a Jack Russell's mouth - are doing better than ever after they were taken in by retired farmer Pauline Kidner. Nursed originally on milk form bottles custard creams were introduced into their diet slowly to see whether the cubs were ready for food. Scroll down for video . The orphaned youngsters - one of which escaped death after being carried by a dog - are doing better . Nursed originally on milk, custard creams were introduced to see whether the cubs were ready for food . 'They were very very tiny, we start them off giving them milk with a teat on syringe,' Pauline said . The first of the badger cubs, named Little Star, was half the weight of an apple when it arrived at the Secret World centre, but Pauline, who runs charity Secret World, says they're growing at an astonishing rate. The 65-year-old, from Somerset, said: 'When they came in eight weeks ago they were 80g, now they're 1.1kg, you can almost see them growing.' 'They were very very tiny, we start them off giving them milk with a teat on syringe, we can't risk any getting in their lungs, but they're now on normal bottles. 'Little Star came from Derbyshire, she was brought into someone's kitchen by their Jack Russell dog, it was very lucky he didn't hurt her, she'd been born two days earlier; her umbilical was still attached . 'The dog brought another one in, but sadly that one had been shaken, so unfortunately it died within 24 hours . Pauline explained to have two badger cubs picked up by dogs in a short space of time is unusual. 'One cub a year is brought in when dogs get down in the set,' she said. The dog brought another one in, but sadly that one had been shaken, so it died within 24 hours . The first of the badger cubs, named Little Star, was half the weight of an apple when it arrived at centre . Jack Russels have an instinct for digging and going down holes and are traditionally used in badger baiting. However, there is no reason to suspect the illegal blood-sport was to blame for the death of this cub. 'Then we had another called Vogue come up from Cornwall, we called her that because was picked up in the village Vogue near Redruth,' Pauline said. 'Then lastly the third came in three weeks ago, that one's from near Cheddar in Somerset, we called him Scrumpy, because of the cider context . When they came in eight weeks ago they were 80g - carers have watched them grow to 1.1kg . They're 12 to 16 weeks once they wean, then they might be moved on to solids by the carers . 'We've been keeping Scrumpy separate as he's older than the two girls. Once they start to mouth things, they start playing with each other, pulling ears, Scrumpy can get a bit rough though.' 'They're still on bottles now, we've started putting in custard creams to see if they're interested, then we might move them on to solids. 'They're in the cubby hole in my kitchen now.' The aim is to release the animals back into the wild once they're strong enough. They're all vaccinated against Bovine TB, before they reduce human contact. Pauline said: 'We'll add another two to the group, we'll keep them together before release in autumn. 'When they're 12 to 16 weeks once they wean, they go down to the Millie Block, which is a separate building. 'After that they turn nocturnal, we feed them at night, then it's on to glassed enclosures when we just throw the food over to them and get them to revert to wild.' 'Sadly if we can't release them, we do have to put them to sleep, which is why we reduce human contact like that.'

"Two states at the center of gay rights protests over laws designed to 'uphold religious freedom' engaged in hurried climbdowns yesterday, with both approving alterations to legislation that critics said legalized discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 'Now that this is behind us, let's move forward together with a renewed commitment to the civility and respect that make this state great,' Indiana Governor Mike Pence said after signing his state's amended measure. The Arkansas legislature also passed changes to its legislation at the behest of the state's Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson, who rejected a previous version of the bill at the last minute on Wednesday following public uproar and a personal plea from his son. Hutchinson signed the new legislation last night. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signs a reworked religious freedom bill into law on Thursday evening. Lawmakers in Arkansas and Indiana hoped that by amending their states' measures they would quiet the national uproar over new religious objections that opponents say are designed to offer a legal defense for anti-gay discrimination . 'Now that this is behind us, let's move forward together with a renewed commitment to the civility and respect that make this state great,' Indiana Governor Mike Pence said after signing his state's amended measure Thursday evening . Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma speaks at a press conference announcing changes to the state's religious freedom law as Senate President Pro Tem David Long, left, looks on. The GOP leaders on Thursday added anti-discrimination safeguards to the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act . 'I think it’s sending the right signal, the way this has been resolved, to the world and the country that Arkansas understands the diversity of our culture and workforce but also the importance of balancing that with our sincerely held religious convictions,' Hutchinson said. The recently empowered governor also suggested he'd issue an executive order banning discrimination in the workplace for state employees, according to a CNN report. The two, GOP-controlled states were in a frenzy this week to quell national outrage over legislation meant to satisfy evangelicals who do not believe they should be compelled by the government to provide goods and services to certain customers if doing so would violate their religious convictions. The moves had the direct effect of upsetting gay and lesbian individuals, however, and incited massive protests. After gay rights activists, sympathetic businesses and celebrities thrust the measures into the national spotlight, both states found themselves in the cross-hairs, and even Republican lawmakers began to distance themselves from the laws as written. Republican leaders in the Hoosier State conceded this week to critics arguing that their state's law, signed into effect by Governor Mike Pence a week ago today, inadvertently left room for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 'It was never intended to discriminate against anyone,' Indiana Senate President Pro Tem David Long said at a Thursday morning at a press conference. Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma, standing alongside Long, said, 'Hoosier hospitality had to be restored.' 'It is causing real harm to real people right now in our state. I'm not talking about those who feel their rights are being infringed, I'm talking about commerce in a major, major way,' Bosma said of the law Thursday . Acknowledging that the changes to the law won't necessarily satisfy religious groups, he said, 'we had to be prompt. We had to be swift.' Opponents of an Arkansas religious objection measure chant 'We Are Arkansas' as they face the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock on Wednesday. Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson earlier that day said he wants the legislature to either recall the bill from his desk or pass a follow-up measure that would make the proposal more closely mirror a 1993 federal religious-freedom law . In addition to the already protected classes of persons, the new language specifies that businesses, individuals and other providers cannot refuse to do business with persons on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. No one has the legal right to 'refuse to offer or provide' goods, services, facilities or employment to anyone for those reasons, it says. Exempted from the new rules, however, are churches and non-profit religious organizations, including schools. After adamantly defending the state's law in the national press, Pence suddenly said Tuesday that 'it would be helpful to move legislation this week that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses a right to deny services to anyone.' The 180 earned him the mocking of the White House, which described him as a 'previously defiant governor' who changed his position after a 'bipartisan and even nonpolitical outcry.' Pence said Thursday he believed the move to change the legislation was in the best way forward for his state. 'There will be some who think this legislation goes too far and some who think it does not go far enough, but as governor I must always put the interest of our state first and ask myself every day, 'What is best for Indiana?' Pence said in a statement. 'I believe resolving this controversy and making clear that every person feels welcome and respected in our state is best for Indiana.' Demonstrators hold signs on the steps of the Arkansas state Capitol thanking Hutchinson for calling for changes to the religious freedom measure. A new version of Arkansas' law is now making its way through the statehouse. The altered bill would more closely mirror federal legislation . The new version of Arkansas' law  more closely mirrors federal legislation. The fixes passed the state's Senate Wednesday night and its House Thursday. Hutchinson on Wednesday had requested the legislative changes, saying he could not sign the bill until they were made. 'How do we as a state communicate to the world that we are respectful of a diverse workplace and we want to be known as a state that does not discriminate but understands tolerance?' he said during a press conference outside the state Capitol. 'That is the challenge we face. Making this law like the federal law will aid us in that effort in communication, but also was my original objective from the beginning.' Upon signing the bill Thursday, Hutchinson said, 'I know it's been a contentious debate.' 'We resolved it in an Arkansas way and in the right way for our country and for the people of Arkansas.' Hutchinson said he recognizes this is not the end of the debate, 'but the fact that it might not solve every problem for everyone probably means it's a good bill.' Conservative lawmakers said they didn't appreciate the slap in the face from Hutchinson, who had said numerous times in the past that he would approve the legislation in its current form when it reached his desk, but they worked to make the necessary adjustments just the same. 'I don't feel it was right for the governor to say he was going to sign something that he watched all the way through and didn't sign,' state senator Terry Rice told Arkansas Online. 'I know things come up at the last minute but now we have hodgepodged some bills together.' That sentiment was shared by Arkansas Family Council, a group that favors the law and pushed to get it passed. 'I'm very puzzled at this point to see why the bill would need to be amended at this late date, considering everybody in the chamber has had a chance to see it,' Jerry Cox, the group's leader, said. 'I think it's been thoroughly vetted, and it's a good law.' A family-owned pizzeria in Indiana that said it wouldn't cater same-sex weddings shut down until further notice on Wednesday after the owners received threatening phone calls, and the establishment's YELP page was flooded with bad reviews . Indiana, the first of the two states to pass the offending religious liberty legislation, saw a fierce backlash over the weekend and early this week that included thousands of protesters descending on the state Capitol and a prominent local business cancelling a planned $40 million expansion of its headquarters after Pence formally approved the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Hutchinson, who took office just two months ago, seeking to avoid an uprising of equal intensity in his own state, pushed legislators in Arkansas to make adjustments to their bill before he put his name on it. The Arkansas-based retail corporation Wal-Mart publicly lobbied the Republican politician not to approve the bill, labeling it as discriminatory.

Struck again: Christian Englander, 30, has thrown a banana peel at a black man for the second time in one week. He was arrested on Monday for hurling one at Dave Chappelle. On Thursday he struck again at a bar . Not amused: Santa Fe police say a man tossed a banana peel at Dave Chappelle during a show in New Mexico Monday, hitting in the comedian in the leg. Here Chappelle performs last summer . Chappelle was performing a comedy routine at the Lensic theater in Santa Fe when a banana peel struck him . According to Englander, his first attack came after Chappelle mocked his friend's name 'Johnny Appleseed'. Police said the 30-year-old, from Santa Fe, appeared to be drunk as he sat near the stage. According to TMZ, Englander thought Chappelle's quips were racist, so he decided to throw the peel, which he had in his pocket. He had allegedly eaten the banana at a convenience store before the show, and washed it down with a shot of the alcoholic beverage 99 Bananas. After the attack, he was escorted out of the venue. On Thursday, he became embroiled in a fight with a man called Jay Wills, Oregon Live reports. Wills was allegedly upset about Englander's attack on Chappelle, and the two engaged in a heated argument, which was not reported to the police. Englander has not been charged with the reported attack. Racial attack: Chappelle told police Englander did not seem remorseful, and he believed the banana attack was racially motivated . Englander was in jail Tuesday, and Dobyns said she didn't know whether he has an attorney to speak on his behalf. Chappelle has had his share of run-ins with audience members in the past. Fueled up: Englander said he ate the banana and washed it down with a shot of 99 Bananas liquor before the show . In a 2013 gig in Hartford, Connecticut, Chappelle shut down his act after 10 minutes because of heckling. Known for his sharp commentary on race relations in America, Chappelle has gradually resumed his stand-up career in the past two years, making a long-awaited return after abruptly abandoning a popular Comedy Central show in 2005. Court documents indicate that following his arrest Monday night, Christian Englander 'appeared unapologetic and made several statements that appeared to be racially motivated.’ A criminal complaint cited by the Albuquerque Journal states that while smiling and laughing, Englander said: 'maybe I should have handed you [Chappelle] the banana instead.' Chappelle told police it seemed that his attacker was not remorseful and that the banana toss was 'racially motivated,' according to the complaint. The 41-year-old comedian indicated that he wanted to press charges against Englander. Once Englander was removed from the venue, Chappelle resumed his routine but spent the remainer of his set harping on the fruit fracas. ‘First I'm going to kill him with my comedy then I'm going to kick him in his f***ing face,’ he said, according to an audio recording made by an audience member and shared online. ‘By the way, these are empty threats.’ He later expressed a desire to hurl a tuna casserole in his assailant's face and to choke the life out of him - but noted that he wouldn't do it because it's against the law. The famed comedian took issue with the fact that the fruit hurled at him was not even fresh and marveled at the fact that someone would carry a banana peel in their pocket. ‘Why didn't he throw a good banana at me? Just the brown peel? Where's the rest of it? I am actually offended by the poor quality of the banana. It was brown, man,’ he was quoted as saying by the news blog NewsCastic. But the pugnacious performer said he was not surprised that it happened to him. ‘I wish I could be, “I can't believe this is happening,” but in all honestly, I've been expecting that banana for many years,’ Chappelle told the crowd. ‘I just didn't know tonight was going to be the night.' The former Comedy Central star also used the incident to gently rib the popular comedy duo Key and Peele, who currently have a sketch show on the cable network. ‘Key and Peele probably did that s***,’ he joked, referring to the banana throw. ‘Key and Banana Peel.’ Chappelle is expected to carry on his comedy tour, performing a show in El Paso, Texas, Tuesday night. Not impressed: The famed comedian took issue with the fact that the fruit hurled at him was not even fresh .","Christian Englander, 30, threw a banana peel at Chappelle, 41, during show at Lensic theater in Santa Fe on Monday .

"Travelling with a pet can be a stressful and expensive ordeal, but Delta Air Lines have come up with a way to put passengers at ease when their pet is in the carrier below. The new pet GPS system allows owners to track their furry friends' journeys in real time, from monitoring the temperature below, to whether their cage is upright or askew. The first-of-its-kind technology was developed by Sendum Wireless Corp. and is available for $50 per flight from 10 US airports. Delta's new pet GPS, available for $50 per flight, allows owners to track their pets on a plane via a website . The move was no doubt aimed to make passengers feel safer about bringing their pets with them on flights, as Delta Air Lines has a less than rosy history of pet fatalities on board. Tragically between 2010 and 2013, Delta reported the greatest number of animal incidents and was held responsible for 41 of the 97 reported deaths that year. They maintain that the high numbers are due to the fact they carry a higher number of pets than competitors. The service is available from 10 US airlines including Los Angeles and Atlanta . Two months ago it was reported that Delta failed to load a number of show dogs on a flight, and staff admitted they did not know where the prized pets were, when they were asked by customers. The dogs had been competing at the prestigious Westminster Dog Show in New York and were headed for Seattle. Angry passengers disembarked and were given a free overnight stay at a hotel near JFK, a refund of their $200 dog fees, VIP service at the airport and spots in the cabin for the dogs for the return flight to Seattle. It is hoped the Sendum Wireless Corp. technology, which has similar trackers for keeping tabs on alcohol and tobacco and to make sure seafood is kept cold, will give owners peace of mind during their travels. Owners of pets at the Westminster Dog Show in New York were told their pets were not on board their Delta flight, and disembarked to go and find them . The pets were safely retrieved, but the airlines has had a number of animal related incidents in the past .","The trackers allows owners to check carrier conditions like temperature .

"Some of the 2,500 police officers who were involved in tracking down the Boston Marathon bombers showed a lack of 'weapons discipline' during two firefights with the brothers, a new report reveals. In the first standoff, the officers fired 'toward the vicinity' of Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 'without necessarily having identified and lined up their target', the 130-page document states. They also reportedly failed to appropriately aim their guns. Amid their chaotic shooting, transit cop Richard Donohue was critically wounded. It is unclear whether he was shot by an officer's bullet. Shortly after the firefight in Watertown, Massachusetts, on April 19, 2013 - which resulted in the death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev - an officer mistakenly fired on a police vehicle carrying two other cops. Scroll down for video . 'Lack of discipline': Some of the 2,500 police officers who were involved in tracking down the Boston Marathon bombers showed a lack of 'weapons discipline' during two firefights with the brothers, a new report reveals . Brothers: In the first standoff, the officers fired 'toward the vicinity' of Tamerlan (left) and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) 'without necessarily having identified and lined up their target', the 130-page document states . Official report: They also reportedly failed to appropriately aim their guns. Amid their chaotic shooting, transit cop Richard Donohue was critically wounded. Above, the After Action Report, which was released on Friday . The unmarked black pickup truck had been 'erroneously reported as stolen'. It was 'spotted driving on Adams Street, near the scene of the shootout, and fired upon by an officer,' the report states. Upon closer inspection, the officer discovered that the occupants of the vehicle were a Boston Police Department officer and a Massachusetts State Police trooper in plain clothing, the document says. Fortunately, both officers were unhurt. Then, later in the night, when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding in a boat, an officer 'fired his weapon without appropriate authority,' causing others to believe the bomber was shooting at them. This caused 'many officers to fire at the boat in the belief they were being shot by the suspect,' says the long-awaited report by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, released Friday. The two standoffs and the car incident all created 'dangerous crossfire situations'. But despite the findings, the report praises many other aspects of the emergency response to the April 15 attacks. Firefight: Shortly after the firefight (pictured) in Watertown, Massachusetts, on April 19, 2013 - which resulted in the death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev - an officer mistakenly fired on a police vehicle carrying two other cops . Suspect: Then, later in the night, when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding in a boat, an officer 'fired his weapon without appropriate authority,' causing others to believe the bomber was shooting at them. Above, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is pictured clutching his chest after emerging from the boat he was hiding in . Timeline: This graphic, featured in the report, details the timing of the two bombs and the following incidents . The document particularly highlights the response of medical personnel at the scene and Boston hospitals who treated injured bombing victims, 16 of whom suffered 'traumatic amputations'. 'The hospitals that received patients rendered life-saving medical care; as a result, every patient that was transported to a hospital from the scene survived,' the report states. 'Overall, the response to the Boston Marathon bombings must be considered a great success.' Best practices . Areas in need of improvement . Krystle Campbell, 29, Martin Richard, eight, and Lingzi Lu, 23, were killed after the Tsarnaev brothers placed two pressure cooker bombs, hidden in backpacks, at the marathon finish line. A further 264 people were wounded in the worst attack on US soil since the 9/11 terrorist atrocity. The new report starts by explaining how April 15 was 'the perfect day for running'. The 'air was cool', the 'sun was shining', and the logistics supporting the marathon were 'operating smoothly', it says. But at 2.49pm, however, 'the race was forever changed', it adds. The first of the brothers' two IEDs detonated at 671 Boylston Street. Thirteen seconds later, 180 yards up, the second exploded. While victims were rushed to hospital, authorities immediately cordoned off a 15-block crime scene area, the report says. A large number of abandoned bags and packages were also screened. The document praises the actions of law enforcement in reacting to 61 reports of suspicious packages in the hours after the bombings - and hundreds more reports in following days. But it notes that many victims in hospital found 'the large numbers of heavily armed police officers and investigators' who were providing security in the building 'to be intimidating'. The patients were left 'frightened' after the officers questioned their families and friends, and collected their cell phones and other evidence, the document states. Explosion: Krystle Campbell, 29, Martin Richard, eight, and Lingzi Lu, 23, were killed after the Tsarnaev brothers placed two pressure cooker bombs, hidden in backpacks, at the marathon finish line (pictured) 'Lack of coordination': The report reveals that there was a lack of coordination and management of hundreds of police officers who converged on a staging area at a local shopping mall in the hours after the shootout . Criticism: It also states that the two shootouts and the car incident created 'dangerous crossfire situations' In relation to the first shootout with the suspects in Watertown, the report explains how the standoff followed the fatal shooting of Sean Collier, a MIT police officer, and a carjacking in Cambridge. During the incident, officers lined both sides of a narrow residential street and began firing at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as he fled the scene, resulting in a 'dangerous crossfire situation'. 'Weapons discipline was lacking by the multitude of law enforcement officers in the field during... the firefight with the two suspects near Dexter and Laurel Streets,' the report states of the shootout. 'Although initial responding officers practiced appropriate weapons discipline while they were engaged in the firefight with the suspects, additional officers arriving on scene near the conclusion of the firefight fired weapons toward the vicinity of the suspects, without necessarily having identified and lined up their target,' or appropriately aiming their guns. 'Officers lining both sides of the street also fired upon the second suspect as he fled the scene in a vehicle.' A timeline of events in the report notes Donohue was shot as the surviving suspect fled. Chilling: Little Martin, who was killed in the bombings, is seen (front circle) just meters away from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (back circle) on April 15. Seconds later, one of two bombs exploded, piercing his body with shrapnel . Victims: Martin (left) was cheering on runners with his family. Right, Lingzi Lu (right) also died in the bombings . The report does not name any of the officers involved in the April 19 incident. More than a dozen officers suffered minor injuries during the deadly shootout, which followed a four-day manhunt. Although officials had deliberated whether to release photos of the suspects at the time, 'weighing concerns about the suspects fleeing and the general safety of the public', they ultimately did so. Donohue only survived after his colleagues at the scene tended to 'slow the bleeding with pressure and a tourniquet', says the report, congratulating the other officers on their life-saving efforts. He was then rushed to hospital, where had to be resuscitated, before eventually recovering. The report shows that initial responding Watertown police officers failed to remove their patrol rifles from the secure mount in their vehicles because the rifles were 'rarely used and securely locked'. It also reveals that there was a lack of coordination and management of hundreds of police officers who converged on a staging area at a local shopping mall in the hours after the shootout. Labels: This picture, featured in the report, shows the labels that were placed on victims after the bombings . On trial: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (seen in a sketch on March 5), who was arrested after stepping out of the boat in which he had been hiding on April 19, is on trial on federal charges relating to the bombing and its aftermath . Many of these cops had 'self-deployed,' the 'After Action Report' states. The chaos was blamed on the lack of a 'single, integrated, comprehensive operational plan for all public safety organizations'. And it notes that Massachusetts Army National Guard soldiers deployed to help police in their efforts to track down the suspects were unarmed due to 'policy of the Commonwealth and the MANG'. This left them reliant on police, 'increasing the risk to both soldiers and officers', the report says. However, the document praises the efforts of the EMS system and officials' successful coordination. 'This coordination resulted in no one single hospital in the area being overwhelmed,' it says. On Friday, Boston Mayor Martin Walsh told NBC in a statement  that he was proud of the elements that the report praised and that the city would learn from the areas highlighted for improvement. 'I know that over the past two years city departments have worked together diligently to take the lessons learned from the bombings and drastically improve our emergency response protocols so we are even better prepared for the future, and we can set the example for other cities,' he said. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was arrested after stepping out of the boat under which he had been hiding on April 19, is on trial on federal charges relating to the bombing and its aftermath. Some of the charges could carry the death penalty. His lawyer admitted in opening statements that he had participated in the bombings but argued that his late brother was the mastermind. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed earlier that night during the initial shootout with police after he was ran over by an SUV, apparently driven by his brother. He had also been shot multiple times . Closing arguments for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's case are scheduled for Monday in US District Court.","Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency report states some cops showed lack of 'weapons discipline while hunting the Tsarnaev brothers'

"Antiquities looted from ancient temples and Buddhist sites in India have been found on display at the Honolulu Museum of Art after a tourist spotted they were sourced from an art dealer facing charges in India. The museum yesterday handed over seven rare artifacts in its possession after authorities found, to the shock of museum officials, that they had been smuggled into the U.S. by former New York art dealer Subhash Kapoor. Agents from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will take the items back to New York and, from there, eventually return them to the government of India. Marc Thomas, chief preparator at the Honolulu Museum of Art, holds one of seven stolen artifacts that were on display in the museum's collection . The artifacts are believed to have been smuggled into the U.S. by an art dealer facing charges in India . The items' origin was discovered after a tourist visiting the museum noticed the dealer, Subhash Kapoor, was listed as their source . Dealer Kapoor, was arrested in 2011 and is awaiting trial in India. Officials say he created false provenances for the antiquities. The discovery was made after a visitor last year recognized the name of Kapoor's New York gallery as the source of a 2,000-year-old terra cotta rattle and contacted authorities, said Stephan Jost, the museum's director. Museum officials then pored over their records and determined six other Indian items had ties to Kapoor. He said Kapoor donated one of the items and sold five to the museum, while one was a gift from someone else. Agents are hailing the Honolulu museum for being the first U.S. institution to publicly and easily cooperate with the investigation, dubbed 'Operation Hidden Idol,' involving four arrests and the recovery of thousands of pieces worth a total of $150 million. 'Owning stolen stuff is not part of our mission,' Mr Jost said. 'I'm not sure we've done anything heroic. We just want to do the right thing.' Mr Jost watched as agents inspected the items - the rattle, figurines, architectural fragments and tiles - and them hauled them in packed crates into a truck. The items were found to have been sourced from Subhash Kapoor (pictured), who is facing charges in India . Brenton Easter, a special agent for Homeland Security, inspects the artifacts in the basement of the Honolulu Museum of Art . This tile is believed to have been looted from a religious temple or ancient Buddhist site in India . They have now been packed up and sent to New York, from where they will be returned to India's government . Martinez stressed there was no culpability on the museum's part, as it wasn't aware of the items' provenance when it acquired them between 1991 and 2003. Mr Jost said American art museums are becoming more rigorous in vetting the history of objects they acquire. 'Could we have done a better job? Sure,' he said. 'Were we a victim? Yes.' Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Brenton Easter said it was not uncommon for unsavory dealers to donate ill-gotten items for tax benefits and other reasons. Mr Easter is part of a group of agents in New York that focus on cultural property crime whose work includes dismantling the organizations behind the crimes and repatriating the seized pieces. Some institutions are reluctant to come forward, partly because of the financial loss involved, he said. It's very rare for evidence to come to light to show a museum has items that were illegally obtained, said James Cuno, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust. An item looted from India is wrapped up in packaging before being sent back to India . The stunning antiquities were sourced from art dealer Subhash Kapoor, who is facing charges in India . 'Claims might come from time to time. But most often those claims are based on just interest or the construction of national identity,' he said. 'If evidence is provided that's convincing, no museum will resist.' He cited an example from about 10 years ago when Italian police uncovered evidence revealing a number of items that were improperly removed from Italy. The U.S. museums where some of the items ended up returned them, he said. Repatriation has become more common in the past couple of decades, said Malcom Bell, a professor of Greek and Roman art and archaeology at the University of Virginia. As a general rule of thumb, museums and art collectors avoid purchasing items exported without clear and valid documentation before 1970 - the year of a United Nations cultural agreement targeting trafficking in antiquities, he said. 'Transparency is important, and if the Honolulu museum has been open, that's probably to be applauded,' Bell said. Kapoor sold six of the items to the museum and donated another, while the seventh was gifted by a second individual .

"A stunning new series of photographs of the late artist Frida Kahlo have been released as part of a new book. In the images, which are featured in Frida Kahlo: The Gisèle Freund Photographs, the formidable painter is seen at her most relaxed, walking around her house in Mexico. The pictures portray the artist in her garden or languishing in her bed, giving an unparralled insight into her life with many of the pictures taken in the years before her death in 1954. Scroll down for video . In the beautiful new pictures by Gisèle Freund the late artist Frida is seen at her most intimate, her she is pictured standing in her garden in Mexico . Beautiful Frida poses in her house (left), in one picture she is seen lying in bed surrounded by books (right) Frida, whose real name was Frida Kahlo de Rivera, was a painter who was best known for her self portraits. These images were strong and she has become  a feminist icon for her striking and unapologetic style, her monobrow and signature, colourful outfits inspired by traditional Mexican  costume. The new  photographs were taken by Gisèle Freund, a German-born French photographer, who had travelled to Mexico in 1950. Having initially only planned to stay for two weeks she ended up staying for two years after becoming friends with Frida and her husband, artist Diego Rivera. Friday looks happy and relaxed here as she reclines on her sofa in a high necked shirt . Frida Kahlo and Dr Juan Farill photographed in her home, 1951, they are standing in front of one of Frida's paintings that was done of the pair . Frida Kahlo: The Gisèle Freund Photographs Photographs by Gisèle Freund Texts by Gérard de Cortanze, Gisèle Freund, and Lorraine Audric Published by Abrams . Gisele lived with the couple and began taking many photographs of the pair as they went about their daily lives. In the introduction to the book, Cortanze quotes Freund's impressions of Kahlo which she had told to Rauda Jamis who wrote a book about the artist. She is said to have said: 'She was a formidable being, but in great distress … not only because of the physical pain due to her terrible tram accident but because she was a deeply conflicted being. 'She loved men, but did not turn away from women. She would shower you with gifts large and small, ranging from a charm, a tiny brass ex-voto, or a good luck stone to pre-Columbian pottery, as well as the heavy jewelry that she was crazy about … . 'One day she told me: I don't want to live a long time. I am really suffering too much.' Frida spent much of her life in pain after a tram accident in 1925. Then a young woman she suffered serious injuries after the vehicle that she was riding in collided with a trolley car. These included damage to her spinal column, a broken collarbone, broken ribs, a broken pelvis, 11 fractures in her right leg, a crushed and dislocated right foot, and a dislocated shoulder. It was the accident which forced her to focus on her painting and give up a potential career in medicine which she had been studying. Kahlo painted to pass the time while she was stuck in bed during the time following the accident. She passed away at just 47 and it is reported that her marriage to Diego was a tumultuous. It is thought that both of them enjoyed extra-marital affairs with Diego angering his wife when he had a relationship with her sister. They divorced in 1939, however, they were back together again by 1940. For all of Frida's hard work though it wasn't really until after her death that her work began to gain world-wide recognition and over the years her pieces have been displayed around the world. Her unique look has also previously been emulated by many celebrities. The singer Beyonce once dressed up as Frida.

"Xiangyu Ouyang, 26, was on a state-sponsored scholarship from Singapore when authorities say she began dosing the bottles with paraformaldehyde--a potentially deadly form of embalming fluid--starting last September . A cancer biology PhD student at Stanford University is facing four felony poisoning charges after confessing to putting a known carcinogen into classmates' water bottles over the course of weeks. Xiangyu Ouyang, 26, was on a state-sponsored scholarship from Singapore when authorities say she began dosing the bottles with paraformaldehyde - a potentially deadly form of embalming fluid - starting last September. Now, the recipient of Singapore's prestigious Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) scholarship has been dropped from the top university and could face as many as 8 years in prison. According to SFGate.com, Ouyang admitted to poisoning two students' bottles as well as her own. 'I am truly sorry for what happened, but I really didn't mean to harm people,' she allegedly told authorities. 'It was me crying out for help.' A former roommate of Ouyang's says both her parents were also researchers. Colleagues called her shy and insecure. One victim told authorities that Ouyang 'had never had a boyfriend, and envied those who had,' Vice reports. Despite her flaws, though, none of her classmates said they would have ever suspected the quiet Singaporean of trying to harm them. However, the students believed someone certainly was. 'I think someone is trying to kill me!' one student yelled after sipping from a poisoned water bottle. The alleged poisonings occurred from September through November, when Ouyang admitted to police she tampered with two bottles and her own. She was part of Stanford's Cancer Biology program but is no longer a student at the prestigious California university . One victim told police she 'immediately experienced a burning sensation in her mouth and throat. Her eyes became irritated and watery. She began salivating uncontrollably. Her throat was burning so bad that she could not even swallow the water.' Paraformaldehyde, a form of embalming fluid formaldehyde, can cause skin irritation, respiratory ailments and, in larger amounts, death. In addition to tissue preservation, the chemical is also used in pesticides. The alleged poisonings occurred from September through November, when Ouyang admitted to police she tampered with two bottles and her own. Poison: Paraformaldehyde, a form of embalming fluid formaldehyde, can cause skin irritation, respiratory ailments and, in larger amounts, death . She told authorities that she's recently seen a psychiatrist and experienced extreme insomnia and dizziness as a result of anti-depressants she was prescribed. Her father told Singapore's The Strait Times the family was not aware of her issues. 'If we had known earlier, we would have sent her for treatment,' he said. He said the girl's mother is now with her in California. She's no longer a student at Stanford. 'This was a sad, heartbreaking situation for everyone involved,' school spokesperson Lisa Lapin told SFGate. 'This was a confined, isolated circumstance and there was no threat to the broader campus community. The university has been providing support to the group impacted.' A spokesperson from Singapore's A*Star scholarship program told the Strait Times they are 'deeply concerned.' However, 'there will be no action on our part until after the proceedings have concluded.' Under California law, Ouyang faces between 2 to 5 years in prison if convicted--up to 8 years if the courts deem the poisons involved can cause 'great bodily harm or death' according to Yahoo News. Ouyang has been released on $50,000 bond. She's expected back in court in May. Read complaint against Ouyang below...

"Five-month-old Elijah is 'the happiest baby ever', according to his mother. He loves everything that moves, especially seeing people and exploring new places. But doctors say he probably won't live to see his second birthday because of a fatal genetic illness. His heartbroken mum Jessica and dad Andrew McCrae have pledged to do everything they can to make sure the little boy from Penrith, in Sydney's west, lives a full life, compiling a 30-item bucket list for their son to complete before he passes away. From a road trip to Queensland to watching the sunrise and set with him, Jessica told Daily Mail Australia the family are planning to show Elijah as much of the world as they can in his final days. Little Elijah suffers the fatal genetic disease Type 1 Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). Born strong, he's now 'very floppy', and doctors say he will probably not survive his second birthday . ‘His sweet face will always know how to bring a smile to my face, even long after he has left us,' his mum Jessica McCrae said . First item on the bucket list: LIttle Ellijah got to visit the Sydney Royal Easter Show at the weekend and meet all of the animals . Fun times: Dad Andrew cradles his little boy . 'Just because he can't move his body doesn't mean he can't enjoy life any other way, like the rest of us can,' his mum told Daily Mail Australia. Little Elijah suffers from Type 1 Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). He gets weaker as he grows older. Born strong, he's now 'very floppy'. His parents were devastated when he was diagnosed. They are refusing to wallow in their sadness. 'You can sit there and be depressed about it, or say, ""he's here for two years, we've got to make the most of it,' Jessica said. The parents were motivated to start the list - which includes visiting Sydney's aquarium and Opera House - by their love for their son, and heartbreak at seeing other happy families having fun with their grown children. 'I thought, ""let's make a bucket list. 'I've got my own - like travelling the world - but (Elijah) won't ever be able to do things like that. 'So why don't we do things we would do with a child when we're older?' The family have already ticked one item off the line-up. They visited the Sydney Royal Easter Show at the weekend. It's the Easter Show! Dad Andrew and mum Jessica are pictured with their baby boy out the front of all the rides at the Easter Show last weekend . Look at those goats! Little Elijah is pictured with some of his furry friends. His parents are hoping to take him to Sydney Wildlife World and Featherdale Wildlife Park as well . 'We have to enjoy it now. We don't get to see him enjoy these things when he's like 10, we have to do it now' Little Elijah was fascinated by all the 'shiny stores' and loved looking at the cakes, his mum said. And in the coming weeks, they are hoping to head out on a road trip to Queensland, stopping along the way at various sights, including Byron Bay, the theme parks on the Gold Coast and The Entrance, on the Central Coast of New South Wales. 'The hardest thing is seeing other families, especially when you go out and see these families having fun,' Jessica said. 'We have to enjoy it now. We don't get to see him enjoy these things when he's like 10, we have to do it now.'

Elijah was born very strong but has lost a lot of muscle because of his condition. ''It breaks you, to see your baby get so weak,' his mum said . The family have made a fundraising page in the hope they can raise the money to complete the list together. But the item they want the most is to celebrate Elijah's first birthday with a big party. 'I want him to celebrate his 21st birthday,' she wrote on Facebook, 'but I'm being realistic'. There is hope that Elijah may survive longer than the doctors have predicted. Elijah has been approved to go into a clinical trial which will hopefully prolong the little boy’s life. 1. Trip to New Zealand . 2. The Gold Coast . 3. Experience Movie World . 4. See Sea World . 5.

"Conversation is limited to ‘mummy’ and ‘bye bye’ and simply standing up unaided is a major achievement. But 11-month-old babies have already mastered the fundamentals of physics. Baby boys and girls were surprised when a ball seemed to disappear through a solid wall. Their curiosity did not end there. When they were then given the ball to play with, they repeatedly banged it on a table in an apparent attempt to work out its secret. Scroll down for video . Babies in the study reacted with surprise when objects like this toy car appeared to break the laws of gravity . The babies were similarly perplexed by a toy car that appeared to defy the laws of gravity and float in thin air. And given it to play with later, they repeatedly dropped it on the floor. Importantly, the babies shown the magic tricks were more interested in playing with the ball than a brand new toy that they had never seen before. Babies might be smarter than we had previously thought and can understand complex social situations from the age of just 13 months old. A study by psychologists at the University of Missouri has found that infants are able to comprehend what constitutes bullying, friendship and what it means to be a bystander. In an experiment with puppets they responded to different scenarios in a way that suggested they were more engaged than had been expected. The findings indicated the newborns had ‘strong feelings about how people should deal with a character who hits others’, the researchers said. And they did better than others on a learning test, in which they had to link a specific sound to the ball. This, say the US researchers, suggests that babies learn from the unexpected, something that is important in a world in which we are constantly bombarded with information. Professor Lisa Feigenson, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said: ‘For young learners, the world is an incredibly complex place filled with dynamic stimuli. ‘How do learners know what to focus on and what to learn more about and what to ignore? ‘Our research suggests that infants use what they already know about the world to form predictions. ‘When these predictions are shown to be wrong, infants use this as a special opportunity for learning. ‘When babies are surprised, they learn much better, as though they are taking the occasion to try to figure something out about their world.’ The professor studied 11-month-olds because they were old enough to sit and watch the ball and to pick it up and play with it. A ball was rolled down a slope and apparently passed through a solid wall in one magic trick in the study . Babies repeatedly droped the car after being shown the magic trick as they attempted to learn what happened . However, previous studies have shown that much younger babies and newborn animals have surprising amounts of knowledge about maths and physics, including whether an object should be able to pass through a solid wall. Writing in the journal Science, she said that some information may be so fundamental to survival that we are born with it. Lead author Aimee Stahl said that young babies are ‘remarkably sophisticated thinkers’. She added: ‘It’s easy to look at a baby and see a blank slate but actually babies have rich, sophisticated expectations about the world. ‘Infants are not only equipped with core knowledge about fundamental aspects of the world but, from early in their lives, they harness this knowledge to empower new learning.’ After seeing the ball trick babies would bang it on the table more as they attempted to uncover its secrets . The graphic above shows the reactions of the babies after seeing magic tricks that defied their expectations . The babies in the study were given choices about the toys they would play with after watching a magic trick . Children who can accurately depict the human form at the age of four are more likely to be brighter in their teenage years, according to a study published last summer. Psychologists at King’s College London studied pictures drawn by more than 15,000 four-year-olds who were identical ans non-identical twins. Those who drew with the most skill were likely to do better in intelligence tests a decade later. The children were asked at the age of four to draw a picture of a child. Each figure was scored between 0 and 12 depending on the presence of features such as a head, nose, ears, hair, body and arms. The children were given verbal and non-verbal intelligence tests at the time they completed the drawing, and again at the age of 14. The researchers found a definite correlation between the drawing scores and the two sets of intelligence scores. Dr Rosalind Arden, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London, said: ‘Our results show that there is a link between the ability to draw at the age of four and intelligence later in life. ‘Through drawing, we are attempting to show someone else what’s in our mind. 'This capacity to reproduce figures is a uniquely human ability and a sign of cognitive ability, in a similar way to writing, which transformed the human species’ ability to store information and build a civilisation.’","Researchers at John Hopkins University in Baltimore showed babies magic tricks where balls seemed to pass through walls and toy cars floated on air .

"Three Ku Klux Klan members who worked at a Florida prison have been charged with plotting to kill a black inmate after his release because they believed the man is infected with HIV and hepatitis and he bit one of them during a fight, officials said Thursday. The case comes as the latest black eye for the troubled state prison system. The three men - Thomas Jordan Driver, 25, David Elliot Moran, 47, and Charles Thomas Newcomb, 42 - were arrested Thursday and each faces one state count of conspiracy to commit murder, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's office said in a written statement. The state said the murder plot started after Driver, an officer at the Department of Corrections Reception and Medical Center in rural north Florida, had a fight with the inmate. Moran is currently a sergeant at that facility. Newcomb was fired in 2013 for failing to meet training requirements, according to the department. Charged: (From left to right) Charles Thomas Newcomb, Thomas Jordan Driver, and David Elliot Moran each were arrested Thursday on one state count of conspiracy to commit murder, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's office said . Bondi's office said the three were also members of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The group has garnered attention in recent months for distributing flyers that likened protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, to terrorists. The FBI was initially alerted to the murder plot by a confidential informant inside the Klan, according to an arrest affidavit. The FBI's affidavit described the informant as 'a confidential human source for the FBI whose motivation for cooperation with the FBI is patriotism.' The informant was present when Driver and Moran talked with Newcomb, identified as the KKK chapter's 'Exalted Cyclops' or leader, and recorded many of their conversations. In late 2014, authorities say Driver provided the Klan chapter, called a klavern, with a photograph of the inmate, who'd been let out on supervised release. 'Both Driver and Moran ... told the (confidential informant) that they wanted (the inmate) ""six feet under,""' the FBI's affidavit said. The informant recorded all three men making plans to murder the inmate - ranging from shooting him to injecting with a lethal dose of insulin, which Newcomb said 'would be quieter.' In the recordings, the men often refer to the man using a racial epithet. The affidavit said the informant, Moran and Newcomb went on a trip together to where the inmate lives in Palatka. Before they made the trip, 'Newcomb pointed out that if they could grab (the inmate) and take him to the river, he would need to bring a fishing pole to make it look like (the inmate) was at the river fishing,' the affidavit said. 'Newcomb told (the informant) he wanted to make it as realistic as possible, but if they had to go in there blazin, they would do what they had to do,' the affidavit continued. Their first attempt to find and kill the inmate failed. 'The FBI pre-arranged to have a law enforcement presence in the area of (the inmate's) residence to prevent a crime being committed that day,' the affidavit said. 'A vehicle with police lights was staged on the same street a block away from (the inmate's) residence and a police patrol vehicle aggressively roved the neighborhood to establish an active law enforcement response.' The informant later recorded a conversation with Driver to confirm he still wanted him dead. 'Okay, but do you want this guy terminated?' the informant asked. 'I think for this individual...I think a message isn't going to do him any good,' Driver replied, according to the affidavit. 'Okay so I take that as a yes?' the informant said. 'Yes sir,' Driver said, according to the affidavit. In March, the FBI gave the informant a burner cellphone with a doctored photograph that appeared to show the inmate had been fatally shot. The informant showed all three men the photograph and recorded their jubilant reactions. 'According to (the informant), Newcomb smiled upon seeing the photograph that depicted that (the inmate) had been shot and killed,' the affidavit said. Moran, whom the men referred to as 'Sarge,' was smiling when he saw the photograph that depicted the inmate had been murdered, according to the informant. 'Moran also gave (the informant) an enthusiastic handshake upon seeing the photograph,' according to the affidavit. 'Driver smiled, nodded his head in a yes motion and shook the (informant's) hand in gratitude,' according to the affidavit. Bondi said and corrections department officials were quick to condemn the suspects' alleged actions, but the incident highlights an ongoing stream of high-profile problems in Florida's prison system. Last fall, prison system officials fired nearly 50 employees, including several over allegations that they punched and beat inmates. The deaths of inmates Randall Jordan-Aparo and Darren Rainey also drew attention. Jordan-Aparo was reportedly gassed while in a confinement cell at the Franklin Correctional Institution. Rainey, a mentally ill prisoner, was punished in 2012 with a shower so hot that his skin separated from his body at Dade Correctional Institution. The warden there was fired. Reaching out: The American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan has garnered attention for distributing flyers that likened protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, to terrorists. A recent flyer from the Klan provided by WTXL-TV is seen here . Incident: The state said the murder plotting started after Driver, an officer at the Department of Corrections Reception and Medical Center (pictured) in rural north Florida, had a fight with the inmate . Department of Corrections Secretary Julie Jones, who was hired late last year to lead the troubled agency, called the arrests 'disquieting.' 'We are moving swiftly to terminate the employees arrested today and working closely with Office of the Attorney General to assist in their prosecution,' she said in a written statement. 'Our Department has zero tolerance for racism or prejudice of any kind. The actions of these individuals are unacceptable and do not, in any way, represent the thousands of good, hardworking honorable correctional officers employed at the Department of Corrections.' The case will be prosecuted in Columbia County in north Florida. Driver and Moran are being held in Union County jail. Newcomb is in Alachua County Jail with bond set at $750,000. Frank Ancona, imperial wizard of the KKK group to which the three men were said to belong, did not confirm or deny their membership. 'We at the TAK do not in any way condone, tolerate, or support any type of illegal activity in our organization and because of this we would stand by any of our members pending a decision by a court of law, not a decision of the court of media or public opinion,' Ancona said.","Thomas Driver, David Moran, and Charles Newcomb each were arrested  on one state count of conspiracy to commit murder .

"Two passenger jets allegedly came within 25 seconds of a mid-air collision over the Arabian Sea. One of the carriers involved, Dubai-based Emirates, referred to the apparent near-miss as an 'air traffic control incident' in a statement on Wednesday. Neither the Dubai carrier nor Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways would say how close the two planes came to each other. However a Resolution Advisory (RA) was given to both planes, which means the distance between the two aircraft could have resulted in a collision within 25 seconds. Etihad have maintained that the safety of its passengers was never compromised after it came 'within 25 seconds of collision' with an Emirates plane . The incident occurred on Monday as passenger planes from Emirates and Etihad Airways were traveling in opposite directions between the Gulf and the island nation of Seychelles. Both carriers have recently rerouted flights to the archipelago nation to avoid Yemeni airspace due to fighting there. Emirates says its flight EK709 was returning from the Indian Ocean island nation of Seychelles when the incident occurred  in airspace controlled from Mumbai, India. Etihad Airways separately says it is investigating 'a reported incident' involving one of its planes traveling in the opposite direction. Both carriers insist safety was not compromised. This graphic shows the time in seconds of being at risk of traffic collision for each of the emergency warnings . The incident involving the Etihad Airways and Etihad occurred over the Arabian Sea in Mumbai airspace . Indian news broadcaster NDTV report that there was 'an emergency warning by the planes' on board collision avoidance systems,' and that both pilots reported the incident to Mumbai air traffic controllers. A Traffic Advisory (TA) is sounded to an aircraft when they are within 40 seconds of traffic in a particular airspace. Following this an RA is then given out if an aircraft is at risk of collision within 25 seconds, and the pilot has six seconds to respond. The Seychelles News Agency confirmed both planes received a ‘Resolution Advisory’ or RA, from the on-board Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). The incident occurred over the Arabian sea when the two planes were passing each other . An Etihad Airways spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: 'Etihad Airways has strongly rejected claims that the safety of flight EY622, Abu Dhabi to the Seychelles, was compromised. 'The traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), which is fitted on all aircraft, ensured that safe vertical separation of both aircraft was maintained at all times. 'Etihad Airways has provided its safety reports to the GCAA and is assisting with its investigation as well as conducting its own investigation into the incident. 'Safety is Etihad Airways' number one priority.' A statement released by Emirates to the Times of India read: 'Emirates can confirm that flight EK 706 on March 29 from Seychelles to Dubai was involved in an air traffic control incident in Mumbai airspace. At no point was the aircraft, passengers or crew at risk. 'All Emirates aircraft are equipped with onboard instrumentation so that crew are alerted in a timely manner of all surrounding traffic. The crew informed the authorities of the incident and later filed an Air Safety Report, which will be forwarded to Mumbai Air Traffic Control. Safety is of paramount importance to Emirates, and we will be cooperating fully with the Mumbai Air Traffic Control in the subsequent investigation.' Both Etihad Airways and Emirates operate multiple flights every week to the Seychelles . Emirates and Etihad have both grown rapidly in recent years, enticing long-haul transit passengers through their Gulf hubs aboard relatively young aircraft. Emirates is owned by the government of Mideast commercial hub Dubai, while Etihad is controlled by the oil-rich Emirati capital, Abu Dhabi. Both carriers are regulated by the Emirates' General Civil Aviation Authority, which had no immediate comment. They each operate multiple flights weekly to Seychelles, a tropical tourism destination that has built close ties to the Emirates.","Incident occurred over the Arabian Sea in Mumbai Airspace .

"Tony Blair has been dragged into a bitter row in Mongolia over plans for gold mining in a region where the elaborate ancient graves of Attila the Hun's warrior ancestors are located. The former premier made an unannounced visit to Ulaanbataar last month in his capacity as a consultant to the cash-strapped government, which is dogged by allegations of endemic corruption. He met new Mongolian prime minister Chimed Saikhanbileg but the secrecy surrounding his trip stoked fears from ecologists and the opposition that he is being deployed to encourage Western investment to the country to massively increase gold, copper and coal mining, despite acute environmental worries. Scroll down for video . Tony Blair with a Mongolian dignitary on his recent visit. The former British premier has been dragged into a row over gold mining plans which could destroy the ancient graves of Attila the Hun's warrior ancestors . A silver plate from the Noyon Uul burials, where some of the ancestors of Attila the Hun (right) are buried . An excavation at Noyon Uul. Ecologists fear a mining boom in the region could destroy sacred treasures . Specifically, there is concern over plans for development of the sacred pine-covered Noyon Uul region around 65 miles north of Ulaanbaatar which has £1.2 billion gold reserves but is dotted with the burial mounds of the rulers of the ancient Hun civilisation, dating back to the first century BC. 'Tony Blair probably came to us because the strategic deposits in the mountain Noyon Uul are the centre of attention,' reported local news source 24 Tsag.mn, citing official sources. The news outlet - which claimed Blair had flown 'secretly' to Mongolia last week - also speculated he was advising on another controversial project, involving expansion of multinational Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi mine in the Gobi Desert, and a possible bailout from the IMF. Atilla was a feared fifth century barbarian warrior who ruled the Hunnic Empire from the Urals to the Rhine. He was born in modern-day Hungary, but his fearsome forebears are seen as originating much further east, in Mongolia. Activists from ecological pressure groups including Save Noyon Uul have protested to the government that plans for a foreign mining company to exploit gold reserves 'will destroy the historical monuments of the Mongols and their ancestors. 'Driven to despair, they promised that if the Mongolian government allows mining in the sacred land of the Mongols, its defenders are ready to give their lives to save Noyon Uul', said one report last week. Mr Blair's visit to Ulaanbataar was not noted on his website. His office said he makes regular Mongolia trips . Noyon Uul is around 65 miles north of Ulaanbaatar and has £1.2 billion gold reserves but is dotted with the burial mounds of the rulers of the ancient Hun civilisation dating back to the first century BC . 'Tony Blair probably came to us because the strategic deposits in the mountain Noyon Uul are the centre of attention,' reported local news source 24 Tsag.mn . Silver decorations for a harness recovered from the burial site. It has up to 200 burial mounds . The Mongolian premier - who recruited Blair to Mongolia two years ago when he held the position of cabinet minister - is seen as the leading advocate of the plan to boost mining in several regions, including Noyon Uul, where Canadian company Centerra Gold may be given the go-ahead to exploit significant reserves. He lunched with the former Labour Party leader after he held a 'text message referendum', dismissed as a cheap gimmick by foes, aimed at garnering support for new mining to boost the flagging economy. The country's president Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj has 'a strong stance against mining of Noyen Uul and wants to leave the cultural heritage site intact', evidently contrary to the position of his prime minister, it was reported. There was no mention of the Mongolian trip on the official website of The Office of Tony Blair, nor any comment from the Ulaanbaatar government on whether his work includes advice on exploiting 50 tons of gold reserves. But Mongolia is under severe pressure to raise revenue from mining to head off an economic crisis after foreign investment slumped 74 per cent last year, with speculation also centering on Tavan Tolgoi, one of the world's largest untapped coal deposits in the South Gobi Desert. Tony Blair Associates one year ago hired Anand Pillai, formerly an adviser to Rio Tinto in Mongolia. Noted Russian scientist Natalia Polosmak - who has made sensational archeological discoveries at Noyon Uul - said: 'This was the burial ground of the Hun elite. Tony Blair takes part in discussions during his visit. He was recruited to work with Mongolia two years ago . Among the precious finds at the Noyon Uul site are these elaborate chariots buried with Hun warlords . Unique fabrics, ancient jewellery, plaques decorated in silver and gold and carvings of fantastical creatures have also been found .

'The collection of fabrics that we found there is unique.' Among the precious finds were elaborate chariots buried with Hun warlords, unique fabrics, ancient jewellery, plaques decorated in silver and gold, and carvings of fantastical creatures. A spokesperson from Mr Blair's office said: 'Tony Blair regularly visits Mongolia as part of his project there - which is already in the public domain - and has a full time team working on helping the government with its reform programme. 'He has nothing whatever to do with any gold mining business or other mining there so we don't know what is being referred to.' A spokesman for Centerra Gold, referring to the company's Gatsuurt mine in the Noyon Uul region, said: 'Our Gatsuurt property has been designated as a deposit of strategic importance. 'We are continuing to work with the government to determine the level of Mongolian ownership in the project and before Gatsuurt can proceed. We need a deposit development agreement and the necessary permits, approvals and regulatory commissioning. 'We are aware of Mr Blair but not the details of his involvement with the government.'","Former premier made unannounced visit to capital Ulaanbataar last month .

"It is probably the most unpleasant experiment you will read about today: what happens when your skin starts to tear. Researchers have uncovered the reason why skin is so difficult to tear even when put under extreme pressures, by cutting samples of real skin and attempting to pull them apart. They found that rather than simply tearing, mammalian skin actually has sophisticated stress resistance properties that prevent holes and cuts from expanding. The researchers cut real skin samples and then attempted to rip them by pulling them apart (shown above) Using X-ray beams they were able to directly observe the microscopic changes that take place in skin to help it resist tearing during their stomach churning experiments. They discovered that the curly fibers of collagen that make up dermis of the skin straighten and stretch in response to a tear to share the load and prevent further damage. Scientists at Gillette have spent nine years studying how to get the perfect shave. Their work has shown why washing the skin is so vital and why you should never, ever tap your razor on the sink, and also settles the debate about whether you should go with, or against the grain . Here are their main findings: . Before the shave, hydrate the hair by washing the skin with a gentle cleanser: This softens the hair and significantly reduces the force needed to cut it. Apply plenty of shave gel: This provides a protective anti-friction layer and improves razor glide for a smoother, more comfortable shave. Shave with a  multi-blade razor using light strokes: Gillette said the razor should do the work, not the person shaving. Change direction: Begin by shaving with the grain of the hair before switching and going against this grain. Make sure blades are not old or dull: The lifespan of razors can vary depending on how often they are used and how hard. As a general rule if the razor begins to drag or doesn't cut as closely as before, replace the blades. Use aftershave: This can be any product containing moisturiser to rehydrate and comfort the skin. Many aftershaves contain alcohol that acts as an astringent to sterilise the skin and provide a barrier against infection. The findings help to explain why the thin layer of cells that cover our bodies is able to provide such an effective barrier to the outside world. Scientists behind the research also hope their findings could eventually lead to stronger new materials that do not easily tear that could be used in aircraft, for example. Professor Robert Ritchie, a materials scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, who was one of the co-authors of the research, said: 'Our study is the first to model and directly observe in real time the micro-scale behavior of the collagen fibrils associated with the skin’s remarkable tear resistance. 'Collagen fibrils and fibers rotate, straighten, stretch and slide to carry load and reduce the stresses at the tip of any tear in the skin. 'The movement of the collagen acts to effectively diminish stress concentrations associated with any hole, notch or tear.' To conduct the experiment the researchers used the skin taken from dead rabbits, carefully removed the hair and placed it in equipment designed to pull the skin apart. They then cut a small notch or hole in the skin and watched how it changed shape as the skin was stretched in a way intended to cause the tear to increase. However, rather than getting bigger as the skin tore, the notches simply yawned open. The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Nature Communications, then used the x-ray beams produced by the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, to study the structural changes that took place in the skin. They found the collagen in the dermis, the thickest of the three main layers that make up skin, changed its alignment at the edge of the tear. The collagen, which is normally in a disordered tangle, straightened and began to slide against each other to absorb the stress and provide extra strength. The researchers found the collagen in the skin dermis changes from being a disordered tangle (shown left) to line up in straight parallel rows (shown right) when skin is damaged to provide strength and tear resistance . Dr Marc Meyers, a materials scientist at the University of California San Diego who also took part in the research, said: 'Straightening and stretching allow the uptake of strain without much stress increase, and sliding allows more energy dissipation during inelastic deformation. 'This reorganization of the fibrils is responsible for blunting the stress at the tips of tears and notches.' Research on skin's mechanical properties dates back nearly 200 years, when physicians began examining stab wounds. The graphic above shows what happens to a notch in skin when it is stretched (left) compared to bone (right) Unlike bone and teeth, which are also made of collagen fibres but tear and crack when under stress, the collagen in the skin appears to change its structure when placed under stress. The researchers behind the latest study are working with the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research. Professor Ritchie added: 'Natural inspiration is a powerful motivation to develop new synthetic materials with unique properties. 'For example, the mechanistic understanding we’ve identified in skin could be applied to the improvement of artificial skin, or to the development of thin film polymers for applications such as flexible electronics.'","Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory used real skin samples to study microscopic changes that resist tears when pulled apart .

The 48-year-old tourist was stopped by police after she wrote her name and the date on the dome of the Florence Cathedral. She used an eyeliner pencil to leave her mark on the marble on Monday morning, but it did not leave any permanent damage, Italian newspaper La Nazione reported. Officials said the tourist used an eyeliner pencil to write her name and the day's date on the cathedral's dome . Staff from Museo dell’Operate del Duomo, a museum which houses artefacts from the cathedral, alerted police, who located the woman and charged her through an interpreter. Completed in 1436, the cathedral is the fourth largest cathedral in the world and one of the most popular tourist attractions in Tuscany. Now a Unesco World Heritage Site, its famous Renaissance dome was designed by architect Filippo Brunelleschi and added in the 15th century. It’s the second time in four weeks that Italian police have charged a holidaymaker for defacing one of the country’s top landmarks. Italian media said the make-up pencil did not leave any permanent marks, but the woman was charged . In March two American tourists were arrested for carving their initials into the Colosseum in Rome. The women, aged 21 and 25, carved a ‘J’ and ‘N’ into a brick wall at the Unesco World Heritage Site and then posed for a selfie. Other visitors saw what had happened and alerted security, with police charging the pair with ‘aggravated damage on a building of historical and artistic interest’, according to reports. With millions of visitors every year, Florence has had its fair share of problems with misbehaving tourists in recent years. Last year an American holidaymaker was caught peeing in Piazza Santa Croce, a historic square, just a few months before two visitors were spotted having sex against a wall near Palazzo Vecchio, the town hall, according to The Local. In 2013, an American tourist upset locals when he accidentally snapped the finger off a 600-year-old statue of the Virgin Mary at Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Museum of the Works of the Cathedral). The 55-year-old man, from New Fairfield, Connecticut, was attempting to compare his finger to that one the statue when the digit broke off.","Tourist used an eyeliner pencil to write her name and the day's date .

Jones believes the mishap cost him the fight as he kept thinking, 'Man, my cell phone just fell out in the ring – and on TV!'

"A former prison is being turned into a hotel where it's hoped guests won't mind being locked up for the night. The jail, once home to men and women detained for petty crimes, will now provide a luxury night's stay for guests looking for a room steeped in history. The Grade II listed building was previously known as Bridewell Prison in Liverpool, and housed inmates for court appearances and short sentences. Bridewell Prison in Liverpool is being developed into a luxury hotel where guests won't mind spending the night . The grotty jail was once home to men and women detained for petty crimes, and is now undergoing a dramatic facelift . The rooms have being transformed into bright and airy abodes, a far cry from the desolate and dark cells they once were . The prison was completely secure and a plaque on the wall, which remains in the reception area today, reads: 'Please do not ask for bail because a refusal often offends.' But the thick lead paint has been stripped from doors and brick walls, exposing traditional brickwork and original iron work features and the exercise yard, once open to the elements, has been converted into a glass covered indoor lounge space. The quadrangle of former cells across four floors has been transformed into slick modern rooms complete with hi-spec en suite bathrooms, LED Smart TV's and art work of famous ex-cons. Bridewell Prison was constructed in 1857-1859 by Corporation Surveyor John Weightman, and was originally designed as a police station and courts complex for the Corporation of Liverpool. The development has maintained much of the historic character of the prison, while offering chic style and comfort . Rooms come complete with photos of former inmates, as well as a kettle and right, spikes that were used as anti climbers in what would of been the courtyard which is now being transformed into a lounge . How the cells used to look like; but now they are somewhat more inspiring and will offer a better night's sleep . At different times, it had 60-90 cells, each measuring 7ft x 7ft with a heavy wooden door, 3ft thick brick walls and stone floors. Each cell had a toilet that was positioned at the end of a wooden bench where a prisoner would have to sleep. There were tunnels underneath the prison, leading to the old courts at St George's Hall and directly to the docks. These still remain, although it is thought they have been blocked over the years. The development is the latest project by staycentral.com - a new Liverpool-based hotel chain. It's due to open in the Spring and will host weekend music and leisure events, pop-up bars and business networking meetings.

Lee Darwen, operations director for staycentral.com, said: 'The walls are super thick with layers of original British bond brick and the doors are solid oak, so there is no danger of being woken by noisy neighbours. 'Bridewell isn't just any normal first opening; it's steeped in history, it's in a brilliant location and most of all it fits with the ethos of the modern micro-hotel concept which staycentral.com will roll out nationwide in the coming years. 'The concept behind staycentral.com is to give both weekend city revellers and mid-week professionals - the so-called Millennials - centrally located, space-efficient crash pads with fast free Wi-Fi, at affordable rates all through the year.

"Arrested: Ashley Doody was arrested on Sunday after allegedly attacking the family dog with a kitchen knife . A 30-year-old mother-of-two allegedly high on bath salts stabbed her family dog with a kitchen knife because she thought it was possessed by demons, according to police in Maine. Aroostook County Sheriff's Office responded to a home in Perham on Sunday and found Ashley Doody acting aggressively and exhibiting unpredictable behavior. They discovered that Doody, who is a nurse, had attacked her mixed-breed dog, Trixie. The sheriff says the dog lost a lot of blood but was taken to a veterinarian and is expected to survive - while Doody is in jail on $1,000 bail. She has been charged with aggravated cruelty to animals and is due to appear before Aroostock County Superior Court on May 19. According to deputies, when they arrived at the home, Doody was threatening to harm herself with the knife. They discovered that she had stabbed Trixie believing the dog was 'demon possessed.' Police have said that they believe Doody had taken bath salts which can cause severe agitation, paranoia, hallucinations and suicidal behavior in users. State animal welfare agents have been notified of the attack and already Doody has been banned from any access to pets in the future. According to her Facebook page, Doody is engaged to be married to Mark Sawyer and has been since May 2008. Seriously injured: Trixie (pictured) is a mixed-breed family dog and was knifed by Doody while she was allegedly high on bath salts on Sunday . Cruelty: According to deputies who arrested Doody she will not be allowed to own a pet after her actions . She claims to work as a nurse at Full Circle Health Care LLC and is a mother to two children. Since the beginning of the month, Doody has been posting self-help and life-affirming messages to her Facebook page such as 'Until you've lived my life, walked my path, suffered my pain and seen what I've seen, I could care less about your judgements.'","Ashley Doody attacked pet dog Trixie  on Sunday after allegedly taking bath salts .

"A Shetland pony has been battered to death with a breeze block in the middle of the night in a brutal attack, devastating the toddler who played with her every day. Charlene Bishop, who is 17 months old, went to feed her pony Taffee on Wednesday and was worried when she didn't meet her at the gate as normal. Her mother Danielle Flisher went to investigate and found the Shetland lying on the floor and dying from horrific head injuries. Sickening: Taffee the Shetland pony was battered to death with a breeze block in the middle of the night in a brutal attack . The left side of Taffee's (left) skull was completely caved in, her left eye was battered outs of its socket and concrete was embedded in her brain . The left side of the pony's skull was completely caved in, her left eye was battered out of its socket and concrete was embedded in her brain. The five-year-old animal also had a broken leg and vets called to the field in Boxley, near Gillingham, Kent, had no option but to put the distressed pony down. Police believe Taffee was battered round the head with a breeze block sometime between 11pm on Tuesday night and 9am on Wednesday morning. Charlene, who had only owned 22in Taffee for three months, visited her every day to groom and feed her and rode her every weekend. Ms Flisher, 19, said: 'I don't understand how anybody could be so sick. 'Taffee was a tiny pony. The vet said she was hit over and over again and it looks like by was more than one person. 'It seems they held her head collar while they beat her. Taffee was crying blood from the damage they did to her skull. Vile: The Shetland was found lying on the floor and dying from horrific head injuries after the brutal attack . 'We got Taffee for Charlene when she was diagnosed with epilepsy. She can't do the same things as everyone else, but she loved spending time with me at the yard and had Taffee to keep her happy. 'They weren't together long but they were amazing. Charlene would climb all over her and Taffee wouldn't mind. 'Charlene would even sometimes tell Taffee off and the pony would go and stand in the corner of the stable like a naughty child. 'She's lost her best friend and she's devastated.' Taffee had a foal, 10-month-old Biscuit, who the family are now in the process of finding a surrogate mother for. Charlene, who is 17 months old, was bought the pony to help deal with her epilepsy and has lost her 'best friend', her mother said . Ms Flisher, a mother-of-two, added: 'I can't believe there are people out there who would do this to a tiny, defenceless pony. 'They would have seen she belonged to a child, she even had a Frozen rug on. 'Charlene doesn't understand death. She saw that Taffee was bleeding but when she woke up this morning she just assumed she was better and asked to go and feed her. It's heartbreaking, we don't know what to do.' Kent Police and the RSPCA are investigating the attack. Three other horses in the same field were shaved in places in the overnight attack and another had a small wound to its head. The family have offered a £1,000 reward for anybody who can reveal those behind the attack. An RSPCA spokeswoman said: 'This sounds like an incredibly upsetting incident. 'We would urge anyone with any information to contact either the police or ourselves on 0300 123 8018.'","Taffee the Shetland pony had to be put down after the breeze block attack .

"One in three GP training places  remain empty, it emerged today, sparking concerns patients will struggle more than ever to access a family doctor. While the Government is desperately trying to recruit more GPs, medical leaders warn the speciality has become unfashionable as junior doctors fear being overworked. The news comes amid a chronic shortage of doctors, and last week it was revealed that 10 per cent of patients tried - and failed - to book a GP appointment in 2013/14. Access to a GP is about to get even worse, as new figures show a third of GP training posts remain unfilled . This means patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year. Each August, junior doctors with two years experience after medical school begin training as either a GP or a hospital doctor. This year, 29 per cent of GP trainee places remain unfilled, at a time when there is already a shortage of doctors. In some parts of the UK, more than 60 per cent of positions remain unfilled, sparking fears patients may struggle to see their GP. The figures, from the GP National Recruitment office website, were disclosed in an investigation by Pulse magazine. Overall, they show that more than 1,000 GP training posts are vacant. In the East Midlands, 64 per cent of posts are unfilled, with 63 per cent vacancy rate in the North East of England. In the West Midlands 47 per cent of posts are empty and across the south Coast 41 per cent of places remain unfilled. In 2013, the last time figures are available, there was a vacancy rate for GP trainee posts of 8 per cent at the same point in the recruitment process. Of the 12 areas across the England, Scotland and Wales, only London managed to fill its vacancies in the first round of recruitment. Doctors warn the figures mean we may be headed for a recruitment crisis, as there is already a shortage of doctors in many parts of the country . Two other areas – Kent, Surrey & Sussex and Thames Valley are expected to do so in the next round of recruitment. Dr Krishna Kasaraneni, chair of the British Medical Association's GP education committee told the Telegraph the figures show the country is headed towards a 'crisis' in GP recruitment. He said: 'We saw a significant decline last year and this is looking even worse – with more and more GPs retiring and not being replaced, we are heading towards a major recruitment crisis.' In many parts of the country, patients are struggling to get access to their GP because there are too few doctors. He said: 'Some practices are having to close their doors, others are reducing the level of service, because there just aren't enough doctors and ever more demands on them,' he said. He added junior doctors are opting to become hospital doctors instead of GPs as they fear they will be overburdened by work as a family doctor. The figures will be a blow Health Education England, the body responsible for GP recruitment, who had set a target to recruit 50 per cent of junior doctors to become GP trainees by 2016. They were already forced to push back their deadline for this target by a year, after applications for GP training fell in 2014. In 2014, after three rounds of recruitment, there was an overall vacancy rate of 12 per cent for GP training posts.","In August, junior doctors begin training as either a GP or a hospital doctor .

"Her style is followed by women across the globe and whatever she wears is sure to sell out within minutes. Yet the Duchess of Cambridge has been dismissed as an ‘uneventful’ dresser by leading author Margaret Atwood. And most controversially, the 75-year-old said Kate hasn’t lived up to the fashion icon reputation of her husband’s late mother, Princess Diana. Scroll down for video . The author said Kate (pictured right) hasn’t lived up to the fashion icon reputation of Princess Diana (left) Miss Atwood said she thinks the duchess is cautious when it comes to clothes and is told what to wear by advisers. But she added she is right not to follow in Diana’s footsteps. ‘I think she dresses quite uneventfully,’ the author of The Handmaid’s Tale said. ‘I think she’s watching her back, I think she probably has people who pretty much tell her what is appropriate for her to wear. The Duchess of Cambridge was dismissed as an ‘uneventful’ dresser by leading author Margaret Atwood . ‘I don’t think she’s become the fashion plate that Diana was, and I think she’s probably doing that advisably,wouldn’t you say?’ Miss Atwood is just the latest high-profile female writer to apparently attack the duchess’s image and public persona. Author Margaret Atwood (pictured) said she thinks the duchess is cautious when it comes to clothes and is told what to wear by advisers . Double Booker Prize winner and Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel has described Kate as a ‘shop window mannequin’ and a ‘machine-made’ princess who has been ‘designed by committee’. Meanwhile Sandi Toksvig has said the duchess doesn’t have a ‘single opinion’ of her own, and Joan Smith caused outrage by labelling Kate ‘unambitious and bland’. Speaking at a talk at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, Miss Atwood, who has also won the Booker for The Blind Assassin, admitted she judges women on the clothing they wear. The novelist, who has been described as a feminist writer, said: ‘Let’s pretend you’re meeting a person for the first time, as you do when you meet a character in a book. ‘What do I see? Your dress, I see your face of course, I focus on that. I see your earrings, I see your necklace, and those are all part of you. They are all part of the total image of who I’ve just met.’ Miss Atwood’s latest book Stone Mattress prompted her to be labelled ‘offensive’ and a ‘man hater’ by critics last year. Last month a £35 black polka dot dress from online retailer ASOS sold out within half an hour of Kate wearing it to an event. And in 2013 the £46 Seraphine dress she wore for her first official family portrait with William and Prince George sold out two hours after the photo was published. Miss Atwood said the Duchess of Cambridge is correct not to follow in Diana’s footsteps .","Author Margaret Atwood dismissed Katherine as an 'uneventful' dresser .

"The first people to be affected by Qantas’s newly enforced 'smart casual' dress code have taken to social media to complain after being turned away from the airline’s lounges for wearing thongs. Qantas warned back in February that it would begin strictly enforcing its business class lounge dress code from April 1 - but not everyone got the memo. Cassandra Hann‎ wrote on Qantas’s Facebook wall on Thursday: ‘Thanks Qantas club Perth for refusing me entry because I was wearing Havianas (I am going on holidays after all).’ Ms Hann fumed: ‘I had just got off a long flight from Sydney to Perth with a tired 15 year old and 3 year old and had to wait at Perth airport for 3 hours for our connecting flight to Learmouth. I was told Qantas have now started to ""enforce"" their Qantas club lounge dress regulations which bans thongs.’ The mother said she never got an email to inform her about the new rules and managed to get into the Qantas lounge in Sydney on the same day while wearing thongs. Scroll down for video . People wearing thongs are no longer allowed in the Qantas lounges around Australia . Disgruntled customers who did not get the memo about the newly enforced Qantas dress code have posted their complaints on social media . ‘Because my kids needed to rest for the 3 hours we were stuck in Perth airport I had to go and buy another pair of shoes as my other shoes were in my checked in luggage. $80 later, a pair of shoes I didn't need nor want and we finally are allowed to enter the lounge,’ she said. ‘This is no way to treat a long term loyal club member who pays plenty of money per year to be a member. If you want to take hundreds of dollars of membership fees off us every year you could at least have sent members a letter or an email informing us of dress regulation changes. Poor effort Qantas. No wonder people are flying other airlines and joining other lounges.’ In February Helen Gray, Qantas' Head of Domestic Product & Service, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From April 2015, customers entering domestic Qantas Clubs and Business Lounges in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney will receive a friendly reminder about the smart casual dress guidelines that apply.' Cassandra Hann‎ said she was refused entry to Qantas Club because she was wearing Havianas . Sex worker Estelle Lucas, from Melbourne, tried to see the upside to the situation . Qantas were unable to be specific about what items of clothing would be banned but said: ‘The vast majority of our members meet and exceed the guidelines, but we have had some feedback from customers that they want to see those guidelines apply to everyone. 'The dress guidelines for our lounges are the same as most restaurants and clubs.' Playing the role of bouncers, Qantas staff are now allowed to use their ‘discretion' to determine if a visitor to the lounge meets the smart casual dress guidelines.’ Singlets, bare feet, and rubber thongs 'in most cases' will be deemed unacceptable in capital city lounges. Qantas lounges have always had dress codes but they have not been strictly enforced before . Qantas said they were 'sorry to disappoint' when Maria Neale was refused entry to a lounge . Alex Koeninger was also turned away from the Perth lounge and wrote on Facebook 'I'll definitely be thinking twice before renewing my membership this year' Alex Koeninger‎, who was also flying out of Perth on Thursday, wrote on Facebook: ‘So I just tried to enter the Qantas Club Lounge in Perth airport and was not allowed in because I was wearing thongs, jeans and t-shirt. ‘Didn't realise any of it was offensive. Although another lounge member walked in wearing shorts and sandals. I'll definitely be thinking twice before renewing my membership this year.’ And Rae Ka‎Qantas complained on the social media site: ‘Not impressed with inconsistent dress code enforcement. Have worn my upmarket thong style sandals in lounge many times before. Turned away this morning. Gold membership. Not happy.’ The decision has reportedly been made after feedback from customers concerned about the style in the lounges . Meanwhile, sex worker Estelle Lucas, from Melbourne, saw the upside to the situation. She wrote on Twitter: ‘Refused entry into @Qantas club because I was wearing thongs I am SO angry but kinda not bc now I have a valid excuse to buy nice shoes [sic].’ She later wrote: ‘AW MAN I FORGOT MY NEW EXPENSIVE SHOES ON MY FLIGHT. I hate you sooo much @Qantas’ And Maria Neale wrote on Twitter: ‘@Qantas refused lounge entry despite full business attire except I like to wear thongs to fly. Small comfort for travelling so much now gone.’ However, not everyone hates the new rules. Adrian Coughlan‎ said: ‘Love the new dress code that applies from April 1 2015 in all Qantas Lounges- great move by Qantas.’ A Qantas spokeswoman told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'Since [Wednesday] the only discrepancy has been with customers wearing rubber and leather thongs which are no longer within the dress code guidelines' 'We appreciate this may have caused some frustration but we're not in a position to flip-flop on the policy.' If you have ever wanted to experience Qantas business class you'll have to dress the part . Men and women are encouraged to dress in smart casual attire if they want to get into the Qantas lounges .

"An infertile woman convinced her new husband to repeatedly rape her 15-year-old daughter so she could have another child. Misty Machinshok, 33, has been jailed for 15 to 30 years for the abuse in which she 'coached' the pair on the best positions to conceive, and held her daughter's hand 'the first few times'. She planned to tell friends and family that the teenager got pregnant with a stranger at a house party in their home town of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Her 29-year-old husband Gary Machinshok, who she met through a website called onlinebootycall.com, will be sentenced this month after pleading no contest to raping the child 'every few days' throughout 2013. Jailed: Misty Machinshok, 33, pleaded no contest to all charges for convincing her new husband to rape her 15-year-old daughter. The court heard it was a plot to have another child, as she is no longer fertile . He also admitted to sexually assaulting her 11-year-old sister but struck a plea deal which means he cannot be charged for it. Prosecutor Nancy Violi called the crime 'the most heinous' she had dealt with in 14 years on the job. The rape came to light when one of the girl's friends alerted a teacher who called police, Violi said. Both victims are now in foster care. Awaiting sentencing: Her husband Gary Machinshok, 29, whom she met on onlinebootycall.com, has admitted raping the girl 'every few days' in 2013, and sexually assaulting her 11-year-old sister . It is not clear why Mrs Machinshok is no longer able to have children. In January, she pleaded guilty to rape, aggravated assault, conspiracy, child endangerment and other counts. Defense attorney Mary Deady conceded that her client had made 'a lot of bad decisions,' but said she was pleading guilty to protect the child from having to testify. Mrs Machinshok' father, Bill Englert, also leaped to her defense to say her involvement in the rape was 'over-emphasized' by prosecutors, according to Inquisitr.","Misty Machinshok of Pennsylvania is no longer able to have children .

"ALFRED HITCHCOCK . by Peter Ackroyd . (Chatto & Windus £12.99 . With this nutritious, compact and superb critical biography, Ackroyd emphasises the importance of Victorian and Edwardian London in the imagination of Alfred Hitchcock — the ‘damp-looking dirty blackness’ of the East End; the ‘manifold ruffianism’ of the Cockneys; the pubs, street markets, theatres and music halls, with their ‘variety acts, dioramas and Italian operettas’. Alfred Hitchcock (pictured) was born in 1899 in Leytonstone, East London . In addition to the gaudiness, the city was a place with dark staircases, gaslight, rain and spooky cobbled alleys: the ideal setting for murder. Hitchcock was born in 1899 in Leytonstone, East London, the son of a wholesale grocer. They were a Catholic family, Irish originally, and the boy who would become ‘one of the most distinguished directors in the world’ was educated by the Jesuits. The bullying Christian Brothers may have taught ‘the virtues of order, control and precision’, but they also instilled (with the strap) a belief in mystery and miracles. The logic and reason, coupled with a mood of anxiety, dread and paranoid suspicion, seeped into Hitchcock’s work: ‘He thought everyone was doing something physical and nasty behind every closed door’. Looking back on his schooldays, he said that, as the Jesuits had frightened him, ‘now I’m getting my own back by terrifying other people’. Hitchcock was never any oil painting. A 5 ft 7 in Humpty Dumpty, he was the neurotic fat boy with piggy eyes, who was filled with ‘lavish and peculiar’ repressed sexual fantasies. His entire oeuvre, Ackroyd suggests, was a study of voyeurism, violence and guilt with, on the one hand, the rape and murder of vulnerable women, and, on the other, the pursuit of a hero accused of crimes he did not commit. His very first work, in 1927, The Lodger, was about a man wrongly accused of being Jack The Ripper and, already, Hitchcock could whip up an atmosphere of ‘doubt and suspense’, the camera dwelling on ‘dark puddles shimmering with opalescent light’. His opening in movies began at the studios in Islington and Twickenham, where Hitchcock created the captions for silent movies and designed the title cards. Here, he met Alma Reville, whom he married in 1926. Alma was an editor who ‘emphasised the importance of smooth continuity and the subtle use of close-up’. She was thin and boyish, wearing trouser-suits tailored at Austin Reed, ‘the gentlemen’s outfitters’. The Hitchcocks lived at 153 Cromwell Road and had one daughter, Patricia. Apart from conceiving Patricia, Ackroyd assures us, Hitchcock and Alma never had sex together again. Ackroyd goes into raptures about The Lodger, which starred Ivor Novello. ‘The use of light was its music, rising in intensity, in the process creating a unique rhythm of meaning’. Would Hitchcock have seen it this way? The shower scene from Hitchcock's Psycho (Janet Leigh pictured playing Marion Crane in the film) is one of the most recognisable shots in cinematic history . When he wrote his granddaughter’s film studies essay for her, he (or she) was awarded a C. ‘Well, I’m sorry. That’s the best I can do,’ he said, grumpily. But it never does to ask an artist to explain his own flavour and texture — it makes for self-consciousness. Such was Hitchcock’s critical and popular success that, by the early Thirties, he was earning £13,000 a year — £700,000 in today’s money. His skill was to merge larger-than-life melodramas — bombs, assassins, enemy agents — with mundane tasks and anxieties, about catching trains, losing a tie-pin, or (notoriously) taking a shower. He moved to Hollywood in 1939, to make Rebecca with Laurence Olivier. The Hitchcocks bought a house in Bel Air and an 85-acre ranch in Santa Cruz. The brightness of California’s blue pools and red clay tennis courts was in marked contrast to London’s charcoal murk yet, as in his English films, Hitchcock found that, in the sunshine, ‘fear became an intrinsic aspect of daily life’. Cary Grant, Gregory Peck and James Stewart were now his wrongly accused leading men. Kim Novak, Tippi Hedren and Grace Kelly were his ‘ideal blonde beauties’, the women alone, menaced by intruders. Princess Grace, in particular, was described by Hitchcock as ‘a volcano covered with snow’ — with the implication that these ice maidens rather liked being plunged into dangerous situations, because it aroused them. He was respected, but not liked. With the stars, Hitchcock was awkward, even contemptuous, calling them ‘cattle’. Marlene Dietrich called him ‘a strange little man. I didn’t like him’, and Hitchcock had an unfortunate fondness for cruel practical jokes — plying people with drinks laced with laxatives, handcuffing people and losing the key. He also ‘had a schoolboy’s obsession with sex that went on and on in a very peculiar way’, the dirty jokes accompanied by salacious groping. Hitchcock (pictured with his two granddaughters) was respected in the industry, but not liked. Marlene Dietrich called him ‘a strange little man. I didn’t like him’ Then there’s Hitchcock’s clammy behaviour towards Tippi Hedren during the making of The Birds and Marnie — ‘he was almost obsessed with me,’ says the actress, ‘and it’s very difficult to be the object of someone’s obsession’. Ackroyd valiantly tries to defend the director’s control freakery by arguing that Hitchcock was doing nothing worse than deliberately trying to elicit a nervous and terrified performance for the cameras.’ Through provocation and bullying, says Ackroyd, Hitchcock was being professional. It was a strategy. Hmm. I think I prefer Francois Truffaut’s observation that ‘Hitchcock filmed scenes of murder as if they were love scenes, and scenes of love as if they were scenes of murder’. The camera always lingers on faces that could be wracked with either pain or pleasure. (‘When he sticks it in her,’ he gleefully instructed his cinematographer prior to shooting a rape sequence, ‘I want the camera right on her face!’) Victims swoon. Hands grasp a neck — strangulation is an embrace, for example, in Strangers On A Train or the shocking despatch of Anna Massey in Frenzy. Everybody remembers Psycho, with Anthony Perkins as the ‘excitable and sexually ambiguous’ Norman Bates — a thin version of Hitchcock himself, it seems. In the shower scene, ‘chocolate syrup was used for the blood’. A smashing detail I hadn’t known before. The audiences screamed to such an extent, Hitchcock pocketed a profit of $15 million. In The Birds, gulls and crows were flung at Tippi Hedren in an attic set for five days solid, scratching her to pieces. Live birds were tied to her body with elastic bands, so that they’d bounce about and flap and perch on her face. ‘The actual biting is done by glove puppets,’ Ackroyd maintains. But a lot of those pecks look genuine — Hitchcock’s revenge, it is said, because Hedren had rejected his advances. Hitchcock died in 1980 from ailments related to obesity and alcoholism: colitis, arthritis, gall stones, renal failure. He’d done more than anyone since Edgar Allan Poe to make our flesh creep. As usual, the Honours Committee made a fool of itself, only getting around to making him Sir Alfred on his deathbed.","Alfred Hitchcock was born in 1899 in Leytonstone, East London .

"Voters in last year's parliamentary by-elections lodged complaints about aggressive campaigning . Voters in last year's parliamentary by-elections lodged complaints about aggressive campaigning tactics, fights between rival supporters, and bizarre activities on polling day, new data shows. In one case, a voter complained that wealthy party donors were luring young activists to a key seat with the 'unfair' promise of free curry, nightclub entertainment and hotel stays. Others, in letters of complaint to police forces and local authorities, accused politicians of 'fly-posting', while detectives were called when scraps broke out over conflicting 'political views'. The details, released to the Press Association under the Freedom of Information Act, refer to the parliamentary by-elections in Clacton, Heywood and Middleton, Newark, Rochester and Strood, and Wythenshawe and Sale East. One eagle-eyed viewer watching the live coverage of the Rochester and Strood by-election, won by Ukip's Tory defector Mark Reckless, was perturbed to see a person 'moving about among the tables and taking items' - something the viewer deemed 'suspicious', so reported it to Kent Police. The same by-election saw six complaints made to Medway Council, one of which was about the apparent unsuitability of a candidate, as well as the length of time it took to count the votes and announce the result. According to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) - whose force area included both the Wythenshawe and Sale East and Heywood and Middleton constituencies - one party organiser found their car was damaged while out delivering leaflets. In another case, a campaigner was attacked by members of the National Front far-right group following a political discussion which escalated to violence. Ukip activists in Newark drew a couple of complaints for fixing party posters to street furniture. The anti-Europe party later came second to the Conservative candidate Robert Jenrick. A resident also contacted the vote's returning officer - who oversees the election - to complain they had been approached by an unnamed party activist in the polling station as they went to cast their ballot paper. And another complained that Tory donors allegedly supplied junior members with food and lodgings in exchange for hitting the campaign trail. The complainant said: 'I feel sure other candidates in this election must have felt that this was completely unfair.' GMP also reported how local election campaigns - which coincided with a parliamentary by-election - saw a complaint made about a defamatory party leaflet, while another prospective candidate in Wigan apparently 'caused people in the street to sign a nomination paper to allow them to stand in the next elections' - despite those signing the document believing it to simply confirm their status as local residents. Bribe: In one case, a voter complained that wealthy party donors were luring young activists to a key seat with the 'unfair' promise of free curry . According to separate figures from the Electoral Commission, 29 million votes were cast at polls held in the UK last year. This included local elections, European Parliament elections and elections for directly elected mayors across the UK as well as parliamentary and police and crime commissioner by-elections and the Scottish independence referendum. UK police forces recorded and investigated a total of 272 cases of alleged electoral fraud during that time, of which four resulted in court proceedings. One of these cases resulted in a conviction after an individual had stolen campaign signs promoting both the Labour and Conservative parties in the Leeds area. An Electoral Commission spokesman said: 'The figures show that proven cases of electoral fraud remain rare, but it is important that no one underestimates how serious it is when it does occur. 'Electoral fraud can refer to many offences, from impersonating a voter at a polling station to making a false statement on nomination papers to become a candidate. 'We have long known that, when fraud is committed, candidates and campaigners are the most likely offenders and voters are the victims. 'Although there are clear plans in place to prevent and detect fraud ahead of the elections in May, there is also a challenge to campaigners. 'They must ensure their behaviour builds trust with all voters, and all those involved in elections must make it a priority to communicate what is and what is not acceptable behaviour at election time.' Assistant Chief Constable Gary Cann of West Midlands Police, the national policing lead for electoral fraud, said: 'A statement about someone's character is different to a statement about their political views. 'A comment about a candidate's politics is probably fair game, but to call someone a bigot or a terrorist or an extremist, for example, is different. It can get very unpleasant.' Anyone concerned about electoral fraud is asked to contact the Electoral Commission or Crimestoppers.","Some wrote complaint letters to police accusing politicians of 'fly-posting'

"Tensions between Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French National Front, and her father have escalated, as the 86-year-old founder of the far-right party defended having described Nazi gas chambers as a 'detail of history'. In words which will revive accusations that the far-Right party remains anti-Semitic, Jean-Marie Le Pen said he had 'never regretted' making similar statements in the past. His daughter and current leader of the party Marine Le Pen immediately distanced herself from the comments saying she 'deeply disagrees' with her 'deliberately provocative' father. Tensions between French National Front leader Marine Le Pen (right) and her father worsened today as the founder of the far-right party (left) defended having described Nazi gas chambers as a 'detail of history' Reigniting old tensions, Mr Le Pen, who is the founding father of the National Front (FN) and still an MEP, said: 'What I said corresponds to what I think. 'The gas chambers were a detail of the war, unless we admit that the war was a detail of the gas chambers!' During an interview on BFM TV in Paris, Mr Le Pen said 'the truth' should 'not shock anyone', and that historical reality should not be used to portray him as anti-Jewish. 'This case was manipulated against me by introducing a hint of anti-Semitism,' said Mr Le Pen. 'I challenge anyone to name an anti-Semitic phrase in my political life. 'Repeatedly questioned about the Holocaust, Mr Le Pen said: 'War is horrible, you know, a piece of shrapnel that tears your stomach, a bomb that decapitates you, a room in which you are asphyxiated, it's all pretty disgusting, it's true.' Firebrand: Reigniting old tensions, Mr Le Pen, who is the founding father of the National Front (FN) and still an MEP, said: 'The gas chambers were a detail of the war' Mr Le Pen's daughter, Marine Le Pen, is now the leader of the National Front (FN) and has tried to steer it away from its anti-Semitic and racist roots. Speaking to the website of Le Figaro daily about her father, she said: 'I deeply disagree with him. 'I take note of what he said but I believe that those coming over to vote for us understand what is going on. He is being deliberately provocative.' Ms Le Pen's party regularly wins up to 25 per cent of the popular vote at local and regional elections, and Ms Le Pen intends to stand for the job of president in 2017. Under her leadership, the party has deepened its roots across France, winning outright control of some town halls and getting its officials elected onto the councils of 'departements', broadly the equivalent of counties. Polls suggest she could make it into the second-round run-off of a presidential election but is unlikely to win. While other FN officials have been stripped of their party membership for racism, there has been no move to bar Jean-Marie Le Pen from a party of which he still holds the title of honorary president. He is popular with many FN members and will stand as a candidate in December's regional elections, despite having been convicted on numerous occasions of being anti-Jewish and for 'inciting racial hatred'. Distanced herself from comments: Speaking to the website of Le Figaro daily, Marine Le Pen said: 'I deeply disagree with him...He is being deliberately provocative' He has regularly made the comment about the Holocaust, telling the European Parliament in 2009: 'I just said that the gas chambers were a detail of Second World War history, which is clear.' Mr Le Pen was first convicted by a Munich court in 1999 for 'minimising the Holocaust' after telling a German far-right meeting that Nazi concentration camps and the gas chambers are 'what one calls a detail'. He has had a string of other convictions, including ones for violence and was briefly banned from being an MEP in 2003 following a physical attack on a French Socialist MEP. Jews have complained of increasing anti-Semitism in France, much of it stirred up by far-right activists. The Nazi Holocaust extended to France between 1940 and 1944, when thousands of Jews were entrained from cities like Paris to the German gas chambers.","Jean-Marie Le Pen reignites tensions after defending view of gas chambers .

"Ho Chi Minh City has just been named one of the fastest growing in the world among the super-rich, according to a new report. Comparing cities over the past decade, New World Wealth has found Houston, Jakarta, Mumbai, and, of course, Ho Chi Mihn City, to be substantially rising in popularity, particularly among the world's most monied. Over the past 10 years, the percentage of multi-millionaires globally has grown by 71 per cent, with an impressive 400 per cent rise coming from the Vietnamese city formerly known as Saigon. Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, has seen 400 per cent growth as far as multi-millionaires calling the city home . When it comes to nationwide statistics, South America boasted multi-millionaire growth of 265 per cent over the 10 year period, while Australia saw an increase of 190 per cent. Among the emerging markets, Russia, China and Indonesia all similarly performed well. China is currently home to 26,600 multi-millionaires, with Germany trailing behind at 25,400 and the United States topping the list with a whopping 183,500. But as far as the highest-ranking cities, Hong Kong comes out on top with 15,400 multi-millionaires calling it home. New York City follows with 14,300 multi-millionaires and London and Moscow are not far behind. 1. Hong Kong - 15,400 multi-millionaire residents . 2. New York City - 14,300 multi-millionaire residents . 3. London - 9,700 multi-millionaire residents . 4. Moscow - 7,600 multi-millionaire residents . 5.

San Francisco - 6,000 multi-millionaire residents . 9. Zurich - 5,600 multi-millionaire residents . 10. Mexico City - 5,600 multi-millionaire residents . A new 10-year study from New World Wealth found Hong Kong to be home to the most millionaires: 15,400 . The concrete jungle of New York City follows closely and is home to 14,300 multi-millionaires . When it comes to nationwide statistics, South America boasted multi-millionaire growth of 265 per cent . But it's Houston, Texas, that takes the title of being the most noteworthy American citiy on the list. The state capital has seen an increase of 1,420 multi-millionaires in the last 10 years, while Seattle is up 330. San Jose, California, Dallas, Texas, and San Francisco, California, have all likewise seen a jump in multi-millionaires of 50 per cent or more over the past decade. IN ASIA PACIFIC: Ho Chi Minh City - 400% growth (2004-2014) IN USA: Houston, Texas - 63% growth (2004-2014) IN CHINA: Fuzhou - 450% growth (2004-2014) IN SOUTH AMERICA: Sao Paulo - 296% growth (2004-2014) In the United States, Houston, Texas, is now home to 1,420 more multi-millionaires than it was a decade ago . In India, the cities of Pune (pictured), Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, and Hyderabad all saw spikes of 200% or more . But it was Fuzhou in China with the most impressive multi-millionaire growth rate: a whopping 450% . In the Asia Pacific region, Jakarta, Indonesia also performed well, going from being the home of 280 multi-millionaires in 2004 to the home of 1,390 in 2014. Meanwhile, in India, the cities of Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Delhi and Chennai all saw spikes of 200 per cent or higher. Perhaps unsurprisingly, China saw the greatest increase overall when it came to the amount of multi-millionaires calling its cities home. For the purposes of the study, New World Wealth separated China out from the rest of the Asia Pacific region, largely due to the fact that so many of the world's millionaires are concentrated there. However, much like Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, there were eight different Chinese cities that saw multi-millionaire growth of over 400 per cent, with the southeasterly city of Fuzhou leading the pack.","New World Wealth compiled list of fastest-growing cities for the super-rich .

"A man trying to elude police jumped into a Missouri creek overnight wearing only his underwear – but his daring gambit did not pay off. Responding officers and firefighters followed the fugitive into the murky waters of Brush Creek in Kansas City and fished him out early Friday morning. The 38-year-old suspect has been taken to an area hospital to be treated for injuries to his arm and leg. He may face charges in connection to a hit-and-run crash. Escape by water: A 38-year-old man stripped down to his skivvies and jumped into Brush Creek in Kansas City, Missouri, after being stopped by police . Up Brush Creek without a paddle: The suspect reached the middle of the creek and spent 10-15 minutes swimming back and forth . According to a Kansas City Police Department’s arrest report, officers were called to a gas station in the 4600 block of Prospect at around 2am after receiving complaints from neighbors about a car blasting loud music. The report states that when police approached the car, a grey 2007 Infinity, and asked to see the driver’s license, the man smiled, said, ‘I’m out!’ and took off from the scene. The Infinity promptly smashed into the north side of the Brush Creek bridge, after which the driver got out of the mangled car and jumped into the water. Police say the 38-year-old suspect stripped down to his underwear and spent 10-15 minutes swimming in chest-deep water, with officers waiting for him on north and south sides of the creek. Surrounded: When firefighters tried to pull him out, he threatened them with a log . Fish out of water: Police officers armed with a BB gun went after the nighttime bather and apprehended him . The bather was complaining of a broken leg, according to Fox4KC, so the Kansas City Fire Department’s water rescue crew were sent in to fish him out. But the half-naked man in the water was not going to go quietly. ‘The suspect picked up a large log and started swinging it at the firemen so they backed off as to not escalate the situation,’ the arrest report states. That is when uniformed police officers armed with a BB gun followed the man into the creek, got him in a choke hold and pulled him out of the creek. Police suspect the man may have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol . Prelude: Before he jumped in the water, the 38-year-old driver fled from police and smashed his 2007 Infinity into a bridge .

"A University of Virginia student whose reputation was trashed by Rolling Stone's discredited tale of a violent gang rape on campus has taken the magazine to task for not firing anybody after its story fell apart. Alex Stock, a former friend of supposed victim 'Jackie', spoke out after he featured in the now-infamous feature A Rape on Campus, and was painted as a callous social climber who discouraged a rape victim from speaking out. 'I think the Rolling Stone absolutely should be held accountable', he said in a TV interview Monday, and added the under-fire magazine has risked its reputation by not disciplining Sabrina Erdley, the reporter who wrote the story. Scroll down for video . Taking to task: Alex Stock, right, who was portrayed as a callous social climber in Rolling Stone's UVA discredited campus rape story said the magazine should be held accountable . Rolling Stone's reporting was torn apart by professors from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, who pointed out 'basic, even routine' failures in how the story was prepared. The most important failing, they said, was not contacting Stock and another student, Ryan Duffin, who spoke out alongside Stock in an interview with Fox News's Megyn Kelly. Stock and Duffin - who were referred to by pseudonyms in the story - would have been able to tell Erdley that there were serious inconsistencies between what Jackie had told them and the story the article credulously repeated. Rolling Stone's story said that Jackie, sitting in a dress stained in blood from a gang rape by seven different men just hours before, sobbed to her three friends, who told her to take it no further. Still employed: Rolling Stone will not take any action against Sabrina Rubin Erdely, whose reporting was roundly discredited . The story said the three - Duffin, Stock and an unnamed woman - were preoccupied with the 'social price' of being associated with rape accusations. Duffin and Stock were painted as wannabe frat boys whose prospects of acceptance would be harmed. In fact, they revealed, Jackie had no blood on her or obvious wounds - and the friends immediately suggested going to the police, which Jackie said she was not prepared for. None of them was ever contacted by Erdley - in Duffin's case because Jackie had falsely told her that he had refused to contribute. When asked whether Jackie herself should have her identity revealed, Stock said: 'I don't see any point in further shaming her. Nobody can track her down, I've even spoken with some friends from her home town - nobody knows where she is. 'I think she's learned her lesson. I think the Rolling Stone absolutely should be held accountable.' When asked whether Erdley should be fired, he said: 'I think the Rolling Stone puts its reputation seriously at stake for not doing that. 'I think the next article she comes out with it's going to be hard for people to take seriously.' Responding to the same question, Duffin said: 'I think much more than anybody losing jobs or not losing jobs I think it's important that Rolling Stone and other media outlets look at this more as a story of what not to do in reporting.' Report: The Columbia Journalism School is expected to release a review of the botched story Sunday night . Many were sceptical when Rolling Stone responded to the damning review Sunday night by standing by Erdley, her editors and her fact-checkers despite the avoidable problems their story had caused. Jann Wenner, the publisher of Rolling Stone, confirmed to the New York Times that everybody would remain in their positions. He defended Erdley's reporting, and described Jackie as 'a really expert fabulist storyteller'. Erdely, who went to ground as the row over her article erupted, issued an apology in the wake of the review, admitting 'I did not go far enough'. Her piece credulously recounted Jackie's tale the story of an anonymous student - referred to as Jackie - who said she was lured to the Phi Kappa Psi house and raped by a gang of seven men. Anonymous: Jackie has never been identified. Police officials say she refused to be interviewed in the course of their investigation . It described the ordeal, during which Jackie said she was passed from man to man in an excruciating three hours of pain, during which she was also supposedly penetrated with a beer bottle upstairs during a pledging event. The article recounted the event in vivid, graphic detail based on Jackie's account. It said: 'There was a heavy person on top of her, spreading open her thighs, and another person kneeling on her hair, hands pinning down her arms, sharp shards digging into her back, and excited male voices rising all around her. 'When yet another hand clamped over her mouth, Jackie bit it, and the hand became a fist that punched her in the face. The men surrounding her began to laugh. Describing the moment she supposedly passed out from pain, it continued: 'Someone handed her classmate a beer bottle. Jackie stared at the young man, silently begging him not to go through with it. 'And as he shoved the bottle into her, Jackie fell into a stupor, mentally untethering from the brutal tableau, her mind leaving behind the bleeding body under assault on the floor.' The review spelled out extensive contact between Erdely and Jackie, spanning eight interviews. Erdely wrote 405 pages of notes about the story. Jackie also spent four hours speaking to a Rolling Stone fact-checker. Erdely had asked repeatedly for the name of the supposed attacker, but Jackie said she was not 'comfortable' with the idea of him being contacted for the story. But they ultimately decided to rely on her for virtually all the information in the account, which led to inconsistencies not being discovered until after publication. Erdely asked Jackie again for the name once the public interrogation of her account began. This time she agreed - but it emerged she did not even know how to spell the surname of the man, referred to as 'Drew' in the story. Experts at Columbia concluded that Erdely, her editors, and the fact-checking department all failed to try hard enough to speak to the accused, and other people mentioned in the story. Claims: The story published in November focused on a University of Virginia student named  Jackie who claimed to have been gang raped by seven men at the campus' Phi Kappa Psi fraternity two years ago. Above, the frat house on January 15, 2015 . Another possible way Erdely could have found out inconsistencies in the story would have been giving fuller details to the fraternity and UVA when asking them for comment, the review said. Stepehn Scipione, the chapter president of Phi Kappa, was asked to comment on the allegations without being given dates of the supposed attack or any details about who was involved. He told the review: 'It was complete bull***t. They weren't telling me what they were going to write about. They weren't telling me any dates or details.' When the full story was published, Phi Kappa Psi responded by pointing out there had been no party on the date Jackie gave. They also said that - despite claims of a pledging ritual taking place at the time - the fraternity house was then home to no pledges. The review concluded: 'Rolling Stone's repudiation of the main narrative in A Rape on Campus is a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable. 'The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking. 'The magazine set aside or rationalized as unnecessary essential practices of reporting that, if pursued, would likely have led the magazine's editors to reconsider publishing Jackie's narrative so prominently, if at all. 'The published story glossed over the gaps in the magazine's reporting by using pseudonyms and by failing to state where important information had come from.' It recommended that Rolling Stone tighten its procedures around fact-checking and offer more details when requesting comment from subjects. It also questioned the use of pseudonyms, and said the magazine should consider banning them. At the same time as publishing the review, Rolling Stone announced that it was 'officially retracting' the story, which has amassed more than 2.7million views online. The page where the story was hosted until Sunday night now redirected to the Columbia review, which has the subtitle 'An anatomy of a journalistic failure'. Sean Woods, one of Jackie's editors, described the scandal over the article as 'It's been an extraordinarily painful and humbling experience'. He later added: 'Ultimately, we were too deferential to our rape victim; we honored too many of her requests in our reporting. 'We should have been much tougher, and in not doing that, we maybe did her a disservice.' In a personal statement released online, Erdely said: 'Reading the Columbia account of the mistakes and misjudgments in my reporting was a brutal and humbling experience. 'I want to offer my deepest apologies: to Rolling Stone's readers, to my Rolling Stone editors and colleagues, to the UVA community, and to any victims of sexual assault who may feel fearful as a result of my article. She said that as a reporter she must: 'weigh my compassion against my journalistic duty to find the truth. 'However, in the case of Jackie and her account of her traumatic rape, I did not go far enough to verify her story. 'I allowed my concern for Jackie's well-being, my fear of re-traumatizing her, and my confidence in her credibility to take the place of more questioning and more facts. These are mistakes I will not make again.'","Magazine published A Rape on Campus in November 2014 issue .

But for all of you that's snapping the cameras, I want you to know there is a God. He sits high but He looks low. He will destroy but yet He will defend and He defends me. And I just want to thank Him. I'm not ashamed to let you know that He sent me not just a lawyer, but the best lawyers. And I couldn't have made it without them. And I want to say to the victims' family, I will continue to pray for you as I have for 30 years. A miscarriage of justice, not only to me, but the victims' family. For all of us that say we believe in justice, this is the case to start showing. Because I shouldn't sit on death row for 30 years. All they had to do was test the gun. But when you think you high and mighty and you above the law, you don't have to answer to nobody. But I've got news for you. Everybody that played a part in sending me to death row, you will answer to God . Hinton was freed after prosecutors admitted earlier this week that they couldn't find evidence that a gun found at his home fired the bullets used in two brutal 1985 murders. 'I shouldn't have sat on death row for 30 years,' Hinton told reporters. 'All they had to do was test the gun,' he said. Hinton had strong words about the prosecutors and jury as he spoke to the crowd. 'I want you to know there is a God. He sits high but he looks low. He will destroy but yet he will defend and he defended me,' Hinton told the gathered. 'I shouldn't have sat on death row 30 years. All they had to do was test the gun. But when you think you are high and mighty and you're above the law you don't have to answer to nobody, but I've got news for you. Everybody who played a part in sending me to death row you will answer to God.' His attorney Brian Stevenson said: 'Mr. Hinton has spent 30 years locked in an 5-by-8 cell and with the state of Alabama trying to kill him every day.' The newly freed man added that is a miscarriage of justice for the victims and their families. The family of one of the men who Hinton was convicted of killing was less happy. He told the Birmingham News that he was not declared innocent - only that there was not enough evidence to uphold his conviction. 'This is a difficult time for my family and at this time the only thing I have to say is God will have the ultimate decision on if he is guilty or not,' said Jason Davidson, the son of John Davidson. Friends say Hinton's first request after his release - finding a buffet to fill up on all the food he missed in prison. Hinton was convicted of the 1985 murders of two Birmingham fast-food restaurant managers. Crime scene bullets were the only evidence that linked Hinton to the crime. However, prosecutors said this week that modern forensic methods did not show the fatal bullets came from a revolver in Hinton's home, or even from the same gun.

'Thank you Lord, than you Jesus,' she could be heard saying . In this undated photo from the Alabama DOC shows Hinton after several years in prison . Hinton said he would continue to pray for the victims' families, as this was a miscarriage of justice for them as well. 'They had every intention of executing me for something I didn't do,' Hinton said. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that Hinton had inadequate counsel and sent the case back for a second trial. Prosecutors had been preparing for a retrial but moved to dismiss the case following the testing on the bullets. The Supreme Court ruled last year that Hinton had 'constitutionally deficient' representation at his initial trial. Hinton's defense lawyer wrongly thought he had only $1,000 to hire a ballistics expert to try to rebut the prosecution testimony about the bullets. The lawyer hired the only person willing to take the job at that price, even though he had concerns about the expert's credentials. At the time, jurors chuckled as the defense expert struggled to answer questions on cross-examination. Bryan Stevenson, Hinton's attorney and director of the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative, said he pressed the state for years to re-test the gun, and for years officials refused. He said the case was emblematic of problems with the justice system. Stevenson has said Hinton was convicted based on bad science because he didn't have the money to prove his innocence at trial. 'He was convicted because he was poor,' Stevenson, who first took on the case 16 years ago, said Friday. Hinton was greeted by his emotional family members immediately as he walked out of jail as a free man. This week, prosecutors announced they did not have enough evidence to re-try him for two 1985 murders .

"Environmental activists rescued 40 crew from a sinking ship it suspected of conducting illegal fishing near the island of Sao Tope, off the Gabon coast. The Nigerian-flagged Thunder was being tracked by activists from the charity Sea Shepherd, who believed it was engaged in illegal fishing. The Thunder's captain and crew manned life rafts late on Monday after the ship was scuttled. Scroll down for video . Rogue fishermen are believed to have scuttled this ship, Thunder from Lagos to cover up illegal fishing . Charity Sea Shepherd had been tracking the Thunder for the past 110 days off the west coast of Africa . The fishing vessel sank in perfect conditions, leading to suspicions that it had been deliberately scuttled . Sea Shepherd's vessels Bob Barker and Sam Simon rescued the men from the ocean. The Thunder had been fishing in the waters between Sao Tome and Principe, off the west coast of Africa. Bob Barker's captain Peter Hammarstedt said: 'It is an incredibly suspicious situation, to say the least. 'When my chief engineer boarded the Thunder in the hours leading up to the sinking, he was able to confirm that there were clear signs that the vessel was intentionally scuttled. 'Usually when a vessel is sinking, the captain will close all hatches so as to maintain buoyancy. However, on the Thunder, the reverse was done - doors and hatches were tied open and the fishhold was opened.' Sea Shepherd said the crew were given food and water and were transferred to Sam Simon. Video recorded by the activist group showed the ship sinking just hours after it said Thunder issued a distress signal on Monday afternoon. The Thunder's crew of 40 all managed to escape into life rafts before the vessel sunk to the ocean bottom . Members of Sea Shepherd launched rescue boats to rescue the members of crew from the ocean . Watertight doors on board the Thunder were dogged open increasing suspicion that the vessel was scuttled . Hammarstedt said Thunder's captain, who was not named, complained about being rescued and 'started applauding and cheering' when the vessel sank. He told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'We've been chasing the Thunder for 110 days now, and I think they're basically at the end of their fuel, and they would have had to make a port call . 'I think the captain of the Thunder made the decision that he preferred the physical evidence on board... was better on the ocean bottom than going into port with him.' Thunder, on a list of boats deemed to have engaged in illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing activities by multi-national body the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), is suspected of illegal fishing for Patagonian toothfish and other rare species in the Antarctic. Toothfish is sold as Chilean sea bass, which is popular in high-end restaurants. It sells primarily in the United States, Europe and Japan, although there is also a growing market in China.

The 21-year-old was stunned when she later received a string of messages from the man, who said his name is 'Miguel'. In one text, the man referred to himself as her 'future hubby' and promised to buy her shoes when he met her. He also sent her a picture of himself in one message, and told her: 'Wow I knew you beautiful but damn you are super beautiful.' After asking how 'his in-laws' were, he said: 'I'm hope I'm not being too, how can I say, forward.' The man repeatedly sent Ms Berry messages featuring photos of himself and kissing emoticons . The man has sent her 18 messages since she made the call, some of which have referred to his family in Liverpool, making Ms Berry fear he may try to approach her. She told the Manchester Evening News: 'It is quite scary, it is quite distressing. He won't leave me alone. Being pestered by someone I don't know gets me quite nervous.' The man has now been suspended by Vodafone, which says it has a number of call centres in the UK but also sends some callers through to their office in South Africa.

"A teenager who allegedly racially abused a security guard on a train has been dubbed 'public enemy number one' as a magistrate warned him to pull his head in following his release on bail. Abdel-Kader Russell-Boumzar was granted bail in Brisbane's Magistrate Court on Thursday after a 69 day stint behind bars for a string of alleged offences. The 17-year-old shot to notoriety last October when footage of him  apparently spitting on 56-year-old Josphat Mkhwananzi while racially abusing him on a Brisbane train went viral. Scroll down for video . Abdel-Kader Russell-Boumzar was granted bail in Brisbane's Magistrate Court on Thursday after a 69 day stint behind bars for a string of alleged offences . He was charged with numerous offences, including serious assault, creating a disturbance and racial vilification. Since then he's been accused of repeatedly breaching his bail by flashing his backside at a young boy, being drunk in public during Schoolies' week on the Gold Coast, being a public nuisance and becoming involved in a brawl at a skate park. Russell-Boumzar was jailed in January after the skate park incident but will now walk free after 69 days behind bars with  Magistrate Deborah Vasta deciding  he had learned his lesson. 'You need to pull your head in,' she told the teenager. Russell-Boumzar first came into the spotlight when a video of him allegeldy spitting on and racially abusing 56-year-old train guard Josphat Mkhwananzi went viral . Magistrate Vasta said it seemed he'd 'gone off the rails' with a 'stupid meltdown' on the train. She said Russell-Boumzar was currently 'public enemy number one' and warned him he would be targeted once released on bail. 'The ball's in your court,' she told him. 'Running around being a big man in town does not cut it when you're in a detention centre.' Russell-Boumzar replied: 'I really understand'. The teen must abide by strict bail conditions, including a curfew, a ban on entering train stations, and no contact with certain associates including the friend who filmed the racist rant. The decision to release Russell-Boumzar came despite a warning by crown prosecutor Megan Fowke. In the viral video, Russell-Boumzar allegedly refers to the train guard as 'n*****' and a 'black c***' repeatedly before he continues to explode into a racist rant during the five-minute video . The 17-year-old has re-appeared in court a number of times since last October after being accused of repeatedly breaching his bail . 'He is a risk, not only to himself but to the community ... he has shown disdain for not only his bail conditions but also this court and its orders,' she argued. Russell-Boumzar is back in Brisbane Magistrates Court on May 4 for charges relating to the train incident. In the viral video, Russell-Boumzar allegedly refers to the train guard as 'n*****' and a 'black c***' repeatedly before he continues to explode into a racist rant during the five-minute video. 'Do you want to come to Australia to learn some proper English?' the teenager said in the video. Shocking footage of an intoxicated young man hurling a tirade of racist abuse on a Brisbane train at a security guard went viral. The guard 'Joe' has been commended for his calm actions during the incident .

'Don't touch me, I don't want to speak to you, I don't understand you,' the 17-year-old said. 'Bro, if you want to be a security guard, learn some English first.' An attendant is heard telling the young man to 'get off' at the next stop. Another security guard, wearing a blue top, is seen walking towards the teenager as he continues to drunkenly slur his words to another train worker.

"Set side by side it’s hard to believe they’re the same person. One with his shy smile, steady gaze and dark hair. The other, five decades on, pouting beneath razor sharp cheek bones, sunken eyes and platinum blond hair. These exclusive pictures obtained by Daily Mail Online show dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Dr Fredric Brandt, the year he graduated from Frank H Morrell High, Irvington, New Jersey. They were taken at the age of 18, when he was, in his own words, just ‘a Jewish kid from Newark,’ and before he had transformed himself, in every sense, into the figure lampooned on Netflix show ‘Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,’ with such devastating consequences. Scroll down for video . The way he was: These exclusive pictures obtained by Daily Mail Online show dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Dr Frederic Brandt, the year he graduated from Frank H Morrell High in New Jersey . Dispirited: The famed 65-year-old doctor was found hanged in his Miami home. He had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show . Changes: Five decades after his high school photo with his shy smile, steady gaze and dark hair, Dr. Brandt was pouting beneath razor sharp cheek bones, sunken eyes and platinum blond hair . It is two days since the famed 65-year-old doctor was found hanged in his Miami home. The City of Miami Police confirmed the suicide after Daily Mail Online broke the news earlier, and, according to those closest to Brandt, the doctor – who had been suffering from depression – had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show. Now, seen here for the first time, Dr Brandt’s High School photos provide a glimpse into his life before fame, fortune and fillers. The pictures, taken in 1967, show a hint of the smile that, according to the school’s yearbook earned him a reputation for his ‘infectious grin’ and saw him characterized by his sense of humor. Known as ‘Fred’ he was a popular and ‘scholarly’ student with, it was noted, the promise of a ‘medical career ahead.’ Born Frederic Sheldon Brandt in 1949, he was prolific in his High School achievements, posing in one photo alongside other award-winning students. Among his many accolades listed are Assistant Editor of High School magazine the Morellian, President of the Spanish Club, Vice President of the Debate Club, Vice President of the Political Science Club and a place on the National Honors Society. He was also an enthusiastic member of the Theatre Arts Society and Tennis team. He was also voted Most Ambitious and Most Talkative student. But, for all that, in one of his last interviews, given to the New York Times in March 2014, he recalled feeling very much that he was ‘more of a different child,’ as he grew up in the Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey. He said: ‘I remember taking things apart as a kid, radios and other things. I was always questioning everything to see how it worked.’ In later life Dr Brandt accumulated vast wealth – he had hundreds of patients, saw as many as 30 daily with some paying as much as $7,000 a pop and had a staggering collection of modern art. But as a boy he grew up in modest circumstances, raised by parents who owned a candy store. Three years before he graduated and before these pictures were taken, when he was just 15 years old, Brandt’s father died from complications of juvenile diabetes. Seven years later, as he was entering his first year at medical school, his mother died unexpectedly. Loss: Three years before these pictures were taken, when he was just 15 years old, Brandt’s father died from complications of juvenile diabetes. Seven years later, as he was entering his first year at medical school, his mother died unexpectedly . Dr. Brandt was known for his ‘infectious grin’ and characterized by classmates as having a sense of humor. Known as ‘Fred’ he was a popular and ‘scholarly’ student with, it was noted, the promise of a ‘medical career ahead.' He was also voted Most Ambitious and Most Talkative student . The awards and accolades followed him from this 1967 yearbook through his professional career . Speaking to the New York Times last March he admitted: ‘It was a lot to process, but you just have to forge ahead.’ He certainly did. Immediately after high school he attended Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1971. He went on to graduate with his MD from Drexel University’s Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia in 1975. Dermatology was not his first love though it would be the speciality on which he settled and which earned him a client list including Madonna, Kelly Ripa, Stephanie Seymour and a constellation of other entertainment big hitters. As a student he loved oncology, nephrology, hematology and cardiology. The one area of medicine in which the life-long bachelor took no real pleasure was pediatrics. He explained: ‘You spent all your time calming patients down.’ Between 1976 and 1978 he completed his internship at New York University Veterans Administration before going onto specialise in dermatology at the University of Miami, 1978–1981. He set up a private practice in Miami and it was only in 1998 that an invitation to use a colleague’s New York office once a month to treat patients with ever evolving newly introduced facial fillers led Dr Brandt to his ultimate area of expertise.

Hurtful parody: According to those closest to Brandt, the doctor – who had been suffering from depression – had been left ‘devastated’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of Dr Franff in Tina Fey’s Netflix show . Tina Fey takes a selfie with Maya Rudolph and  Martin Short last February. Poignantly, given his own unhappy demise, Dr Brandt’s ambition in his work had always been, he said, ‘to restore a face to harmony,’ and ‘to keep people working and feeling vital and good about themselves.’ He built an empire on his work. As well as seeing his private patients, he hosted a weekly call-in show on Sirius XM radio, ran a company manufacturing his own line of skin creams and serums and appeared regularly on the speaking circuit proselytizing on his speciality at international medical conferences. Over the years Dr Brandt practiced what he preached. He became best known for his Y lifts in which fillers are injected below the cheekbones. And he regularly injected himself with Botox, Restylane, Perlane, Juvedem and Voluma leading to his own startlingly changed appearance - converted into cruel and undeniable parody on ‘Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt’ as Dr Franff. The good life: In later life Dr Brandt accumulated vast wealth. He had a staggering collection of modern art. But as a boy he grew up in modest circumstances, raised by parents who owned a candy store . Played by Martin Short Franff’s transformation is so grotesque that he can barely utter certain words – including his own name. He is actually called Grant, rendering the veil of fiction between the character and Brandt even more gossamer thin. At one point the character is seen drinking from a surgical bag and reinflating his face after being punched. For Dr Brandt, who had always prided himself on being ‘a kind of pioneer in pushing the limits to see how things work and what the look would be,’ the humor, viewed through the prism of his depression, cut deep. There have been many tributes since his death Comedian and former The View star, Joy Behar, yesterday tweeted, ‘Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed.’ Morning show host, Kelly Ripa, posted: ‘My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr Frederic Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer.’","Photos obtained by Daily Mail Online show surgeon to the stars Dr Brandt, who hanged himself in Miami on Sunday, the year he graduated from his New Jersey high school .

"'My, my! At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender,’ sang Sweden’s fab four in their famous Eurovision Song Contest winner. Now this may come as a surprise, but you would be well advised not to rely on Abba to help with your history homework. If Benny and Bjorn actually laboured under this surrendering misapprehension when they wrote their song (songwriters are not hot on facts – happy to say anything as long as it rhymes), they would have discovered the truth when they subsequently paid a visit to the Wellington Museum in Waterloo, just south of Brussels in Belgium. View of Hougoumont farmhouse from The Lion's Mound or Butte du Lion on the battlefield of Waterloo, Belgium . Judging by the photo of Abba’s visit, prominently on view in the museum, the group seems to have been treated to a rapturous limousine procession through the town. My, my: the people of Waterloo must have been delighted. Napoleon certainly didn’t surrender at Waterloo. There was a long day’s fighting on that June day in 1815 and a very shaky start for the UK team, but thanks to some late-arriving Prussian assistance, the boy Wellington eventually done good. When Napoleon saw that things were going badly, he hot-footed it to Paris, where he later abdicated. Shortly afterwards, Boney was taken by the British to the remote Atlantic isle of St Helena, where he died six years later in circumstances that merited the forensic attentions of a Miss Marple. ‘Waterloo’ quickly entered the English language as a synonym for ‘a decisive defeat’. But while the British know what happened when Napoleon met his Waterloo, the French-speaking world is less convinced. Battle of Waterloo reenactors stand in historic costume, with rifles and flags . Belgium is divided into two halves: Flemish-speaking and French-speaking. It is unfortunate for anniversary-celebrating purposes that Waterloo lies in the French half where the locals are preparing to mark the bicentenary of the Battle of Waterloo – with Napoleon as the unchallenged star of the show. Local Anglo-Belgian entrepreneur Anthony Martin has invested a substantial financial stake in plans for marking the anniversary by turning a Templar hospice on the edge of the battlefield into a magnificent restaurant-cum-brewery (where he brews Waterloo beer, of course) and a museum looking at the surgical side of the battle (not for the squeamish). It would be fair to say that Mr Martin is not best pleased by the outbreak of Napoleon-worship. He points to the poster advertising the re-enactment event which will be taking place this summer over four days from June 18 to 21; the photograph shows a giant, heroic Napoleon towering over the smaller, less impressive figures of Wellington and Prussian leader Blucher. ‘It’s ridiculous,’ says Mr Martin. ‘The French-speaking world refuses to believe Napoleon lost the battle. A painting of the Battle of Waterloo; 2015 marks the 200th anniversary of the battle . As far as they’re concerned, he scored some sort of moral victory. He lost. But they won’t accept it.’ However, the French-speaking world – and especially the French – don’t figure very significantly in the numbers of tourists who visit the famous battlefield site every year. The British – and the English-speaking nations of the world – remain fascinated by the victory and the bloody manner in which it was achieved. Actually, horror-seeking tourists visited the battlefield almost before they had finished burying the bodies. Poet Lord Byron, something of a Bonaparte fan, suddenly found he had time to visit the battlefield when his lavish coach, modelled on Napoleon’s battle carriage, broke down on his journey from the Channel to the south. 'My, my! At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender!' Abba pictured in the town of Waterloo, Belgium in 1974 . In a Top Gear moment, Byron treated himself to a charge across the battleground on a large Cossack horse he had hired, making himself perhaps the first battlefield tourist. Hard on his heels came Poet Laureate Robert Southey; Sir Walter Scott; the artist Turner; and, a few years later, William Wordsworth. It’s worth recalling that Wordsworth, as a young man, had welcomed the French Revolution (‘Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive…’) but rapidly shifted his political stance to somewhere far to the right of Attila the Hun. Soon Waterloo was established as one of the great continental sights. It was British tourists visiting Waterloo who discovered the neglected city of Bruges – largely derelict after its access to the sea silted up – and helped to finance its restoration. There was an unmistakable sense that Waterloo had been a defining moment in history: Europe had been reshaped and, the odd Franco-German conflict apart, peace reigned for a century. The pleasure of the area around Waterloo is that in many ways it has barely changed. A statue sits atop the Lion's Mound, which commemorates the battlefield at Waterloo, Belgium . If you have time, follow the progress of the conflict along La Route Napoleon – what else? – from Beaumont, where he camped near the French border on June 14, to the fields south of Waterloo where he was defeated four days later. Despite facing superior forces with a hastily assembled army, it is extraordinary that Napoleon came very close to victory. Wellington reflected: ‘It has been a damned serious business. Blucher and I have lost 30,000 men – the nearest run thing you ever saw in your life...’ Unbelievable for me was encountering the present Duke of Wellington in the flesh at Waterloo. He was attending the opening ceremony for a new exhibition at the Wellington Museum on the ‘Shared Destinies’ of Wellington and Napoleon, who fought each other often but never met. It runs until the end of July. My favourite exhibit is Lord Uxbridge’s wooden leg. At the end of the battle, Uxbridge was riding near Wellington when they came under cannon fire. ‘By God, sir, I’ve lost my leg!’ announced Uxbridge, to which Wellington replied: ‘By God, sir, so you have!’ Uxbridge was taken to the town of Waterloo, where his right leg was amputated above the knee. His only recorded comment during the operation was: ‘The knives appear somewhat blunt.’ Presumably he had taken advantage of the pint of gin offered as anaesthetic to anyone facing an amputation. The severed leg was buried behind the house and its grave became a tourist attraction. Sadly it is no more, but you can see his wooden limb in the museum. Perhaps the most interesting sight on the battlefield is Hougoumont farm, whose heroic defence by the British is recognised as the pivotal moment of the battle. Efforts to restore the property and turn it into a museum were for a long time frustrated by lack of funds, but the project was rescued last year following the intervention of Chancellor George Osborne who, it turned out, was something of a battlefield enthusiast. An injection of £1 million has ensured Hougoumont will open to the public for the first time for the celebrations in June, with guests able to stay in a self-catering cottage within the farm – and as far as I could tell from my visit last month, Hougoumont is a Napoleon-free zone. May marks the 75th anniversary of Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Allied troops from Dunkirk . Dunkirk . While June marks the anniversary of a glorious victory, May sees the 75th anniversary of what has sometimes been referred to as a glorious failure: Operation Dynamo – the evacuation of Allied troops from the beaches near Dunkirk from May 26 to June 4, 1940. The extraordinary rescue, the largest evacuation in military history, saw 338,226 soldiers brought home to England in the face of ferocious bombing from German aircraft. Walk along the wide beach at Zuydcoote, a 15-minute drive from the centre of Dunkirk, and at first glance there is little to hint at the awful scenes of death and destruction here 75 years ago. I was there with Bruno Pruvost, a diver who has explored the wrecks on and near the beach – some of the 336 ‘little ships’ that set sail from England, answering the emergency call, but which never returned. At low tide you can visit the wreck of the Crested Eagle, a Thames river cruiser that picked up 600 men from the beach but was then bombed by a Stuka. With his ship in flames, the captain beached the ship with the hope of saving as many of his passengers as possible, . You can find out more about the Crested Eagle and the other ships at the excellent Memorial du Souvenir at Dunkirk. Also well worth visiting is the Fort des Dunes, built as part of a grand defensive line against possible German invasion in the 19th Century – and which played its part in the evacuation. Back on the beach at Zuydcoote, Bruno picked up a small black pellet from the beach: ‘Coal from the bunkers of sunken ships – this gets washed up all the time.’ The sea is still giving up its war souvenirs.

"A ginger tabby cat sneaked inside a shipping container in Egypt before embarking on a mammoth 3,000 mile trip to Herefordshire - without food and water. The kitten, who has since been named Sinbad, was discovered by puzzled staff at Mediterranean Linens in Moreton-on-Lugg, Hereford. They heard meows coming from inside the container, which was carrying laundry linen. The RSPCA was called out to investigate and there they found the exhausted and ravenous eight-month-old kitten, who had made a bed for himself in one of the boxes. Sinbad the cat survived a  3,000 mile and 17 day journey from Egypt to Hereford in a shipping container . Sinbad with vet Amy Wheelr (left) and RSPCA inspector Pippa Boyd (right), who was called out by the company to investigate after they heard strange noises coming from the container . Laura Quinn, from the RSPCA, described the case as 'unique' and said it was incredible Sinbad had survived the 17-day journey. She told MailOnline: 'When we found him, he was really hungry, thirsty and tired but he also looked really friendly and was quite vocal. 'It's really unique, we've not had anything like this before. He had travelled quite some way. The linen company were also shocked by what had happened.' RSPCA inspector Pippa Boyd, who was called out to the scene, added: 'The company showed me the paperwork. They have to seal the containers and put a tag on there, which they did when the container left. They showed me the paperwork and the tag, and it did all match up. We thought maybe at customs someone might have opened it up, but they didn't.' Once found, Sinbad was taken to the Laurels Veterinary Surgery in Whitecross, Hereford, where he was fed a little at a time. He has now gone into quarantine in Bristol for four months. He will then go to an RSPCA centre for checks and it is hoped he will then be re-homed. This map shows the route taken by Sinbad took, from Alexandria Port in Egypt to Moreton-on-Lugg, Hereford . Sinbad, a ginger tabby, was found in the container where he had made a bed for himself in one of the boxes . RSPCA inspector Pippa Boyd said it was an incredible feat to have survived the 17 days and hard to believe . His epic journey began at the Nile Linen group in Alexandria port in Egypt on March 8. The container got to El-Dekheila port on March 9, Felixstowe in Suffolk on March 24 and then Moreton-on-Lugg on March 25. Graham Monteath, 56, managing director at Mediterranean Linens, said they could not work out what the noise was when the shipping container arrived. He said: 'I have never heard a cat meow like that in my life. I would never have thought that was a cat. 'One of the lads thought it was a baby. I thought it could have been a buzzard trying to get into the warehouse because we do get lots of them around here. 'I just turned round and thought ""good God', what is that?"" Then this cat's head popped out of the door. 'We checked the seal and it had not been tampered with. It was very odd. The RSPCA woman said that she was very surprised how well the cat looked. 'It had scratched open one of the boxes. There was not much of a mess but we did not use any of the linen by that.' He added: 'I gave him the beef which was for my lunch. He scoffed it. 'So he got some good British food for his first meal on English soil.' Sinbad, the ginger tabby cat, started his epic journey in Alexandria port in Egypt (pictured) on March 8 .

After covering 3,000 miles and following his 17 day ordeal without food and water, he arrived at the Mediterranean Linens (pictured) in Moreton-on-Lugg, Hereford . The quarantine stay will cost the RSPCA almost £2,000, so an appeal page has been set up to cover costs. Mediterranean Linens has donated £100. Donations have also been received from Paragon Laundry/ Clean Linen Services and Fresh Linen. So far more than £1,500 has been raised.","Journey started at Nile Linen Group in Alexandria port in Egypt on March 8 .

"An author has claimed that 'people are ready' for his forthcoming play which stars impressionist Alistair McGowan as the disgraced paedophile Jimmy Savile. Journalist Jonathan Maitland said while there had been some shock at the drama, An Audience with Jimmy Savile, the majority of critics are eager to know when they will be able to see it. It will open in London in June, less than three years since the late comedian's depraved behaviour was exposed in a television documentary. Scroll down for video . The author of a play which sees impressionist Alistair McGowan portray Jimmy Savile has said the public is ready for it to be shown . The revelation that Savile had abused dozens of children and young women in hospitals and schools throughout the 70s and 80s sparked an enormous Scotland Yard probe into other alleged abuse. Although some lines of inquiry are still ongoing, Maitland claims now is an appropriate time to thrust the subject into the arts. In an interview with The Guardian he said: 'It has changed everything; it has changed the way we look at abuse, it has changed the way we prosecute it, it has changed attitudes towards it, the way we treat the survivors of it. 'What person would not want to explore what kicked it off?' Drawing on interview transcripts and statements provided to the police by some of Savile's many victims, the play's central role has been given to impressionist Alistair McGowan. Most often recognised for his comedic performances, Maitland said his leading actor is also 'terrific' at embodying the 'dark, nasty' elements of the story. In his popular BBC series, The Big Impression, McGowan included Savile in a bizarre comedy sketch in which he portrayed American rapper Eminem. McGowan previously portrayed the comedian in his popular series The Big Impression. In a sketch he responds to a teenage Eminem's repeated requests to appear on Jim'll Fix It . Twitter users rejected Maitland's claim the public was 'ready' for the play, describing the subject choice as 'unbelievable' Dressed in a blue and white tracksuit similar to those worn by Savile, McGowan writes to the Jim'll Fix It host to ask whether he could appear on the programme with his mother to whom he is violent. Later he impersonates Savile himself, responding: 'It would be hard to let you hurt your mum on the TV, especially at tea time.' Sinisterly, he then tells the fictional teenage Eminem that the pair could go to Alton Towers 'in a few hours' before giggling and licking his lips. Author Jonathan Maitland said people were 'ready' for the play to be shown less than three years after the abuse was exposed . Before opening to the public the play will hear findings of the Dame Janet Smith's inquiry into abuse at the BBC. While Maitland said he will be happy to adjust any contentious parts to its liking, he is confident the public, and Savile's victims, will be prepared for the drama. 'Yes it will be strange to see someone doing him for the first time, but I think people are ready.' Critics have however slammed his 'unbelievable' subject choice. One Twitter user said it was 'not quite right' to portray the scandal, while another commented: 'Why not make Fritzl the musical?', referring to the Austrian predator Josef Fritzl who imprisoned his daughter for 24 years to carry out horrific sexual abuse. John Caswell refuted Maitland's claim that the public were ready, responding: 'It's official, I am not people'. But a lawyer acting on behalf of 178 of the comedian's victims said she had met with the playwright and was satisfied the play had been produced in good taste. 'From what Jonathan has told me it will be extremely sensitive and will not in anyway undermine the seriousness of the subject ,' said Liz Dux, specialist abuse lawyer at Slater & Gordon. 'After meeting with him and discussing the project at length , I'm satisfied he will not cause offence to any of the victims . In fact some have agreed to meet with him.'

"A Kansas City man who graduated from high school in 1977 has been saying thank you to the teachers that left a lasting impression on his life - by sending them sums of money. Kevin Perz, 56, a father-of-four and business owner, has been looking up the teachers he has the fondest memories of from his days at Parkway Central High School in Chesterfield, Missouri. Over the past few years he has been mailing them a 'gift'. It started in 1992, when he sent a check to his calculus teacher made out for $5,000. Then in 2002, he sent a $10,000 check to his former business teacher. Huge gesture: Kevin Perz, 56 (right), a father-of-four and business owner, has been looking up the teachers he has the fondest memories of  mailing them a 'gift'. He recently sent Marilyn Mecham (left), his onetime home economics teacher, a check for $10,000 . The thank you note: This is the letter Kevin Perz sent his former teacher, which had a $10,000 check attached to it. In it he says he would be 'sad' if she didn't spend the money on herself . Perz (left) recently sent Marilyn Mecham (right), his home economics teacher in 1977, a check for $10,000 . However the person he really wanted to surprise - his home economics teacher - was the hardest to find, because Perz only knew her as Mrs Mecham. Perz enlisted the help of the Alumni Association, who went through decades-old board room minutes. They were then able to uncover the name for Perz - Marilyn Mecham. From there, Perz was able to find a phone number for Mecham's son, who he called and asked for her information. Perz then called Mecham and told her how long it took him to get to that point. 'I was so appreciative to have somebody spend all that time looking for you to tell that you meant so much in their life,' Mecham told ABC News. Mecham was moved by the call, and took to her Facebook profile to urge others to reach out to someone who had impacted their lives. Flashback: Marilyn Mercham (left) was in her first year of teaching when she had Perz (right) as a student at Parkway Central High School in Chesterfield, Missouri, in 1977 . Kind: Perz said he felt it important to show the people who had impacted his life how grateful to them he is . However that wasn't the end of it. Two days later she received a handwritten letter from Perz, reiterating what he had told on the phone. Attached to the letter was a check for $10,000. Perz had written he would be 'sad' if Mecham didn't spend it all on herself. 'She called me Monday - she said she got it Friday and she spent the whole weekend crying,' Perz told ABC News. 'Everybody in their life can always think back to someone in their life who had an impact, if it's a teacher or a boy scout leader or anyone.' Great teacher: Marilyn Mecham was in her first year of teaching when she taught Perz in home economics . Perz owns a company called Dynamic Fastener, which sells tools and fasteners to commercial contractors throughout the country. The experience has left a lasting effect on Mecham, who was in her first year of teaching when she taught Perz. 'Gratitude is something in this society today that we just don't do enough of,' Mecham told ABC. 'It's made me stop and think who do I want to thank,' she said. 'Whatever I did my first year of teaching was quite unremarkable but what Kevin has done is really remarkable.'","Kevin Perz, 56, owns a construction equipment business in Kansas City .

"Sacked: But Jeremy Clarkson will not face prosecution over the incident which got him sacked from Top Gear . Jeremy Clarkson will not face prosecution over the attack on a Top Gear producer which led to him being sacked from the hit BBC show. Police had opened an investigation into the incident, which took place at a hotel in Hawes, North Yorkshire last month after Clarkson had been filming Top Gear in the area. However, after the victim Oisin Tymon said that he did not want to press charges, officers have now decided to drop the probe without taking action against Clarkson. A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘North Yorkshire Police has now completed its routine enquiries following the incident at Hawes involving Mr Jeremy Clarkson, and we will not be pursuing this matter any further. ‘North Yorkshire Police takes a thorough and victim-led approach to all investigations. ‘Last week, the person at the centre of the incident, Mr Tymon, said that he did not wish the police to take action on his behalf. ‘However, at that point we still needed to speak to some members of the public who were present at the time of the incident, who had been affected by the event, and whose views also needed to be considered. ‘Now that all the interviews are complete, we have properly established that there is no need for further police action.’ The incident, described as a 'fracas' by BBC officials, occurred when Clarkson discovered that the hotel where he was staying could not serve him a hot meal following a day's filming. An official report found that the 54-year-old presenter punched Mr Tymon in the mouth before being dragged away by a witness, causing the producer to go to A&E for emergency treatment. He also verbally abused him for 20 minutes, blaming Mr Tymon for failing to ensure that he could get a steak at the hotel. Victim: Oisin Tymon told police he did not wish to press charges against Mr Clarkson . Mr Clarkson was suspended as Top Gear presenter as soon as news of the fight came to light, and after the report was released the BBC announced that it would not renew his contract. He has repeatedly apologised to Mr Tymon both in public and privately, and the producer told North Yorkshire Police he did not want to see Mr Clarkson prosecuted. Despite his sacking, Mr Clarkson is set to take part in a series of Top Gear Live shows alongside co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May, although the performances will be rebranded. The BBC has said that Top Gear is likely to continue in some form, but Mr Hammond and Mr May are not expected to return. The star initially received widespread public support - including from his friend, Prime Minister David Cameron - in the aftermath of the incident, while one million people signed a petition calling for the BBC to reinstate him. Trio: Mr Clarkson is still set to appear in Top Gear live shows alongside Richard Hammond and James May . But director-general Tony Hall said 'a line has been crossed' and that 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. Lord Hall has faced death threats since he announced that Mr Clarkson would be sacked, and has had bodyguards assigned to protect him and his family. It is not yet known what Mr Clarkson's next move will be - he has been linked with a move to another channel, while the decision to continue the live shows has prompted speculation that he could continue to work with Mr Hammond and Mr May. It has also been suggested that Top Gear boss Andy Wilman, a childhood friend of Mr Clarkson, could be leaving the show, after an email to staff which was widely interpreted as a farewell to Top Gear was leaked last week. Last week it emerged that Mr Hammond and Mr May were each selling off several classic motorbikes from their extensive collections. The 12 cycles have a guide price estimate of £66,000, but the novelty value could push up the price far beyond that - though Mr May insisted the sale was not linked to Mr Clarkson's dismissal. The co-presenter has mocked his own newfound unemployment since the incident, recently posting a video of cooking tips in which he instructs viewers how to make a shepherd's pie.","Top Gear presenter was sacked after punching Oisin Tymon in the mouth .

"A pensioner has been fitted with a magnetic nose after his own had to be removed when he was diagnosed with a rare cancer. Richard Curry, from Loveclough in Lancashire, was told he had malignant melanoma in his septum, the thin strip which separates the nostrils. He was warned that he would have to have his nose removed to stop the cancer from spreading but could be fitted with a prosthetic. Pensioner Richard Curry, who wears a prosthetic nose attached to his face using magnets, after his own had to be removed when he was diagnosed with cancer . But in order to make sure that the new nose stayed in place, the 71-year-old then had to have magnetic implants inserted into his cheekbones and nasal cavity during a procedure at the Royal Blackburn Hospital. And now Mr Curry has spoken of his shock at how successful the operation has been of keeping his new nose in place. He said: 'Losing my nose was something of a shock but I didn't have much choice because this kind of cancer is one of the most dangerous you can get. The 71-yer-old had a procedure to have metal implants inserted into his cheekbones and nasal cavity in order to hold his prosthetic in place . 'I ws just grateful it was caught in time and removed, and when they mentioned they could attach a new one with magnets, I just thought it was amazing.' Mr Curry's nose was removed in 2013, after he spotted traces of blood in a tissue, and the implants were gradually inserted of the course of the next 12 months. He added: 'In the early days I wasn't quite sure how much adhesive to put on, and my stick-on nose would sometimes fall off in hot weater, for example. 'And there was an incident in Asda which gave the girl on the till a bit of a shock. 'The implants were all ready last September and I was so pleased with the results. 'It's comfortable and it looks good, and I've even still got my sense of smell. 'I just need to get it touched up for colour every now and then, like before going on holiday so it matches my skin.' Mr Curry, a retired civil servant, who lives with his partner James Rogerson now wears his new nose all day but removes it at night when he goes to bed. A check-up last month found no signs of the cancer returning when he met with prosthetist Tony Simpson, maxillofacial surgeon Gary Cousin and ear, nose and throat specialist Paddy Morar. Mr Morar said: 'Cancers of the nose are not that common at all, you probably only get one every three years or so, so this was a very unusual procedure. Mr Curry's prosthetic nose, which is held on by magnets. Specialist Paddy Morar says it is fairly common to use magnets to attach prosthetic ears, but was the first time they had used them to attach a nose . 'Magnets are used quite commonly with prosthetic ears, but this was the first time we had used them to attach a nose. 'Richard couldn't have radiotherapy so it had to be surgery and we were extremely impressed by his attitude throughout, he's a very strong character and a model patient. 'It just shows there is life after this kind of radical surgery.'","Richard Curry, 71, was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in his septum .

"The owner of the East Village building that blew up last week and left two dead people could yet face criminal charges, it has emerged. Nicholas Figueroa, 23, and Moises Locon, 26, both died when the Manhattan apartment building collapsed last Thursday following a massive blast. Investigators have now shifted their focus to what caused the explosion, with suggestions someone may have improperly tapped a gas line serving one of the buildings. Scroll down for video . The clean up continued yesterday at the site where several buildings collapsed following the ferocious blaze . A crane removes large pieces of debris as firefighters watch on from the roof of a neighbouring building . Firefighters watch the clean up continue at the site of the explosion which killed two people . In August utility workers discovered the gas line to the restaurant had been illegally tapped, it has emerged . Nicholas Figueroa (left) was killed in the explosion while on a date, while Moises Lucon (right) worked at the restaurant and was identified yesterday as the second victim . The New York Post reported an investigation is now underway into possible gas tapping, with a criminal case expanded to include Haria Hrynenko, the building's landlord. Sources told the paper possible charges include second-degree manslaughter and reckless endangerment. The explosion at 121 Second Avenue in the East Village set alight the property, while its neighboring buildings, 119, 123 and 125 Second Avenue, were also engulfed before all three buildings completely collapsed to the ground, leaving a massive hole on the corner of the block at 7th Street. The medical examiner yesterday confirmed the identity of the second victim using DNA analysis as that of restaurant worker Moises Locon. He had been working six days a week and his family said during his free time he enjoyed taking his nephew to a Queens park. He was reported missing after the explosion and his body found days later. Another 22 people were injured. Meanwhile, in August, utility workers had discovered that the gas line to the restaurant had been illegally tapped, according to Consolidated Edison. Firefighters battle the flames following the explosion at 121 Second Avenue in the East Village last week . The off-duty first responder reached the ground just in time, because just moments later the fire intensified . Horror: Looking towards the fire from Astor Place, flames could be seen reaching into the sky . The discovery led Con Edison to shut down gas service to the building for about 10 days while the building owner made repairs. Gas service was restored after the utility deemed it safe, the utility said. Inspectors from Con Ed visited that building about an hour before last week's explosion and determined work to upgrade gas service didn't pass inspection, locking the line to ensure it wouldn't be used and then leaving, it was claimed. The work underway was to put in a bigger line to serve the entire building, Con Ed President Craig Ivey said. Fifteen minutes later, the sushi restaurant's owner smelled gas and called the landlord, who called the general contractor, Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said. No one called emergency dispatch or Con Ed. The contractor, Dilber Kukic, and the owner's son went into the basement and opened a door, and then the explosion happened, burning their faces, Boyce said. Kukic - who's facing unrelated charges of bribing an undercover investigator posing as a housing inspector - declined through his lawyer to comment on the circumstances surrounding the explosion. Firefighters continued to blast water at pockets of flames among the rubble the following day . Photographs taken on Friday showed three buildings entirely collapsed following the explosion .

"The son of Gerry Anderson, the brains behind the original Thunderbirds, has criticised the computer-generated remake for lacking the 'magic' of the classic show. Jamie Anderson said the CGI characters did not have the same charm as the 'lovingly detailed' miniature puppets. Thunderbirds will return to our screens tonight 50 years after the futuristic puppet show launched and landed all over the world. However, the jerky puppets that rescued the world from all kinds of disaster have been replaced by CGI images to create an entirely new look. Original: Gerry Anderson, co-creator of Thunderbirds, with star puppets Parker and Lady Penelope . Remake: In the updated version, the 'lovingly detailed' puppets are replaced by computer-generated images . Writing for the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Anderson, whose father died aged 83 in December 2012, said: 'The classic Thunderbirds shows have sometimes attracted fond criticism as ""quaint"", ""naff"" and ""full of wobbly sets"". 'But there is something to be said for real-world physics, the constraints they bring to film-making, and the ingenuity and beauty that results as we grapple with them. 'With CGI, by contrast, anything is possible. There are virtually no limitations. Impossible camera angles and effects can be achieved, and constraints get ever looser.' He added: 'I'm very fond of puppets, physical models and practical effects – real explosions rather than computer-generated ones. 'There is something utterly magical about seeing a puppet come to life under the skilled operation of talented puppeteers. 'Sadly for fans old and new alike, that's not going to be possible with the new series.' Iconic: Gerry Anderson with a model of Thunderbird 1 - his son Jamie has criticised the new CGI characters . Quest: As with the original show, the remake will feature the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world . Thunderbirds aired in the UK between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002. There were 32 episodes over two series, broadcast in 66 countries. The show sparked a merchandising frenzy, with more than 3,000 Thunderbirds products sold, so much so that December 1966 was labelled Thunderbirds Christmas. As with the original show, the remake will feature the adventures of the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world through their secret organisation International Rescue. The five brothers, all named after real astronauts on America's Mercury space mission in the early 1960s (Scott, Virgil, Alan, Gordon and John), all live on Tracy Island in the South Pacific in 2065. When they hear of trouble anywhere on the planet their swimming pool slides open to allow a rocket (Thunderbird 1) to take off. There is also an aircraft carrier, submarine and spaceship based on the island. The original show was made on a factory estate in Slough, Berkshire, on a shoestring budget . The iconic children's classic aired in the UK between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002 . Jamie Anderson, son of Gerry, said there was something 'utterly magical' about seeing a puppet come to life . The updated version of the iconic show is not the first attempt at a remake. Thunderbirds, a 2004 Working Title film with real actors (including Ben Kingsley as arch-villain The Hood), was a dismal flop, losing almost £20 million at the box office. Even Gerry Anderson, the show's co-creator, called it 'the biggest load of c**p' he had seen. The original show was made on a factory estate in Slough, Berkshire, on a modest budget, but the new production team spans the globe. Peter Jackson's animation workshop Weta in New Zealand made the 26 episodes (a further 26 are already commissioned) using a mixture of live action and computer graphics. Rosamund Pike, the Gone Girl star, will voice Lady Penelope in the new show and 89-year-old David Graham has returned to voice her driver, Parker. He has dropped his chauffeur uniform and now sports a roll-neck sweater. He also has a clipped Indian accent. The new version kicks off on today at 5pm on ITV with a double episode, before moving to an 8am slot on the same day.","Jamie Anderson says CGI characters lack the 'magic' of the iconic show .

Shocking revelation: Steven Carl Day was allegedly murdered on December 18, 2013 after he told two friends that he molested young girls and that he thought, 'one of them was starting to like it' Day met up with Musick and Mccombs at a bar on December 18 to have drinks for Mccombs' birthday and that's where the shocking confession allegedly took place. 'My jaw just dropped that he would just admit it, blurt it out like that. I looked over at Roger and he was just as shocked as I was.' Musick, 39, mouthed the words 'I want to kill him,' Mccombs told the court. Mccombs told the court that the next thing he knew, Mccombs was attacking Day. Mccombs describes seeing Musick holding Day in a choke hold on the floor. 'When I saw him in the choke-hold, his arms were down, his eyes were bulging. He wasn't moving,' Mccombs told the court. The Detroit Free Press reports that the roommates put Day's dead body into the back of Mccombs' van and headed north where they found a ridge to drop the body. Addiction: After the murder in 2013, friends of Day said he was an Army veteran who had struggled in recent years while battling an alcohol addiction . Mccombs said that the two had breakfast before parting ways. Musick went to work and Mccombs went to their home to get rid of Day's belongings. He claims that he put Day's backpack and coat in a trash can at a nearby shopping center and then rode Day's bike to an abandoned car wash near the home. When detectives found Day's hat and cell phone in Mccomb's van, both he and Musick were charged with murder. Days later the charges were dropped but they were both later arrested and charged with tampering with evidence. Open container: This mug shot of Steven Carl Day, who described by friends as an alcoholic, was taken in 2011 after he was charged with consuming alcohol in public . Mccomb's was released from jail in Early March after more than a year behind bars for the 'tampering with evidence' charge. Musick was also about to be released but police later found there was enough evidence to charge him with Day's murder. Musick was returned to the Kent County Jail without bond. Kent County Sheriff's Detective Martin Albert said he found evidence at Day's home after the 2013 murder that suggested he he had admitted to molesting a five-year-old relative, 35 years ago. At the time of his death, Day had never been charged or prosecuted for any molestation crime. Though, Day was taking part in the Salvation Army's 12-step 'Turning Point' program during which Day confessed in a letter to the molestation. The program is intended to help participants confront their demons, particularly with addictions. Detective Albert testified after the murder that Day's sister was helping with the murder investigation and  told him her brother had admitted the molestation of a five-year-old relative about 35 years ago. A detective who analyzed the cell phones of both Mr Musick and Mr McCombs told Michigan's M LIve text messages had been sent between the two the day the body was found. McCombs allegedly wrote: 'You OK? The world is a better place today and one little girl can sleep tonight because her monster is gone.' Musick allegedly replied: 'True'.","Steven Carl Day's confession over drinks that he molested young girls led to his murder, Robert Mccombs, the roommate of the alleged murder testified .

"More than 50,000 Britons have signed up to a scheme offering discount starter homes to those desperate to get on the housing ladder. The news comes as David Cameron today reiterates his pledge to offer the cut-price properties to 200,000 young first-time buyers. The project, launched last month, is part of a dramatic extension of the Help to Buy scheme – and doubles the number of new starter homes in England from 100,000 to 200,000. Help to buy: The extension to the scheme has been well-received with 50,000 people registering interest in the scheme since it launched last month . The properties would be at prices 20 per cent cheaper than their market value and reserved purely for first-time buyers under the age of 40. Mr Cameron will say today: ‘Home ownership goes to the heart of our political beliefs. It’s simple: we believe having a home of their own gives people and families independence; it helps people stand on their own two feet; and it’s one of the ultimate symbols of a country where if you work hard, you can get on.’ Figures published yesterday reveal 52,000 people have already registered an interest since the scheme was launched last month. The 20 per cent discount is possible because the new properties will be exempted from taxes and reduced construction costs thanks to the release of cheaper, brownfield commercial land to build on. Affordable homes: 50,000 Britons have signed up to a scheme offering discount starter homes to those desperate to get on the housing ladder . As well as helping struggling young people wanting to buy a home, Tory strategists believe it will appeal to parents and grandparents worried about their families’ prospects of ever getting onto the property ladder. Each starter home will cost no more than £250,000 outside London and £450,000 in the capital. First-time buyers will also be able to combine the 20 per cent discount with a Help to Buy mortgage – which offers homeseekers a 20 per cent Government-backed equity loan. The Help to Buy equity loan scheme was introduced in 2013 to offer buyers a 20 per cent Government loan to buy new properties, worth up to 95 per cent loan to value. It was due to expire in 2016 but has been extended until 2020. Under Labour, housebuilding fell to levels not seen since the 1920s. The number of first time buyers also collapsed, falling 60 per cent from 501,500 in 1997 to just 185,000 in 2009. Although the total number of new houses being built in the 12 months to June last year rose to 137,780 – a 22 per cent increase on the previous year – the Government says far more must be done. But shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds criticised the Government’s record on home ownership, adding: ‘Warm words from David Cameron about home ownership will ring hollow for those young people and families who have been priced out of home ownership over the past five years.’","Project doubles number of new starter homes in England to 200,000 .

Even less impressed was the shopper who stood stony-faced in front of the creation for several moments, while another burst into laughter as soon as she spotted it. It did, however, prove an immediate hit with a pair of police sniffer dogs who wagged their tails as they gave it a thorough sniffing down. The artwork, which has been given pride of place in the shopping mall's atrium, was commissioned by UKTV to mark celebrate its screening of the third series of Sherlock. It took a crew of eight people to complete the sculpture, which took over 250 man hours to create and weighs 40kg . Does it look like me?

"Most women have known the frustrated feeling of nursing the broken heel of a irreplaceable shoe. Or perhaps even experienced the struggle of finding footwear that is appropriate for all occasions. Tanya Heath Paris has revolutionised women's footwear with her collection of shoes that feature an interchangeable heel. Scroll down for video . Tanya Heath Paris features hundreds of heel varieties that slide and click into place, and can be released at the push of a button . A high heel (up to 3.5 inches) can be swapped for a lower heel (1.5 inches),without compromising the style . The first of their kind, the shoes, which start from £260) are supposedly comfortable and come in a variety of styles. Every shoe features a button on the inside of the shoe, in the centre of the heel. Once a new heel is slid into the shoe, it is locked into place, and at the press of the button, the heel can be released and slid out of place. The fact that the heel unlocks also makes awkward packing attempts a lot easier, and means that the heels can be also be slipped into an evening bag. In terms of storing the shoes, the heel can easily be slid off and packed away, which makes for less clumsy carrying or packing . There are hundreds of heel varieties available, from high to low, stiletto to chunky, and in a large array of prints . The brand was perfected in September 2013, with the tagline reading: 'Same shoe, different heels, endless possibilities.' From strappy metallic sandals, to versatile black pumps, there are styles to fit all occasions, and that's before the multitude of heel choices are taken into consideration. Canadian-born designer Tanya Heath has lived and worked in Paris for the last 20 years . The interchangeable heels come in all widths, from chunky and secure, to a stylish stiletto, and prints vary from leopard print, to pink glitter, to even adorned with metal spikes. Undoubtedly, the real sell is that, without changing the form or composition of the actual shoe, a high heel (up to 3.5 inches) can be swapped in for a low heel (1.5 inches). Masterminding the brand is Canadian fashion designer, Tanya Heath. The 44-year-old has lived and worked in Paris for the last 20 years, and worked in strategy, consulting, technology and private equity. Also a wife and a mum of three, Heath had no prior professional training and was completely self-taught. When Tanya talks about inspiration for the start of the brand, she insists that it was completely personal. '[The inspiration was] From my life. I wore high heels to work, to restaurants, to parties. 'I wore them everywhere but I could never manage the pain. Once I nearly had a car accident when my heel locked under the break. 'I just fantasised non-stop about a shoe where you could just take the heels off, and that would go from a comfortable low-heel to a high-heel, and still make me look good!' Tanya has admitted that it was difficult to create a shoe, where the composition wouldn't change depending on the height of the heel. 'It took 14 engineers and two and a half years to perfect the arch and the clip. 'Once we had a working principle, over 10 designers, shoe technicians and last specialists worked on creating styles that work in multi-height.' Her shoe collection has now become fully integrated with her own wardrobe. She has worn a style from the collection 'every day of my life for the past 3 years!' Tanya Heath's invention means that high stilettos (pictured left) can be swapped for a chunky more comfortable heel (pictured right) depending on the occasion . It's not only just the heel height that's the selling point - different prints can boost the outfit. In this case, pink sparkly heels are being chosen and slid on . In terms of the celebrities Tanya would want to wear the heels, the list is endless. 'There are so many women who I admire. I would love Kate Middleton to try a pair because she has single-handedly re-branded fashion for the monarchy. 'And also Emma Thompson, who was so clearly unhappy with the comfort of her heels last year at the Academy Awards.'","Canadian-born designer Tanya Heath, wanted to create a comfortable heel .

"Fear of spiders is a survival trait written into our DNA, researchers have discovered. Dating back hundreds of thousands of years, the instinct to avoid arachnids developed as an evolutionary response to a dangerous threat, the academics suggest. It could mean that arachnophobia, one of the most crippling of phobias, represents a finely tuned survival instinct. And it could date back to early human evolution in Africa, where spiders with very strong venom have existed millions of years ago. Scroll down for video . Researchers say a fear of spiders is a survival trait written into our DNA and dates back thousands of years, Stock photo . Study leader Joshua New, of Columbia University in New York, said: ‘A number of spider species with potent, vertebratespecific venoms populated Africa long before hominoids and have co-existed there for tens of millions of years. ‘Humans were at perennial, unpredictable and significant risk of encountering highly venomous spiders in their ancestral environments. ‘Even when not fatal, a black widow spider bite in the ancestral world could leave one incapacitated for days or even weeks, terribly exposed to dangers,’ he told the Sunday Times. The research team carried out an experiment in which 252 volunteers were asked to study computer screens containing abstract shapes and data. Their reactions to images of spiders were very fast, even if their shape was distorted, when compared to much more clear images of other objects known induce disgust or fear, such as needles and flies. The researchers point out that spiders are often small dark creatures that tend to hide in recesses and are hard to spot. Dr New said: ‘Detection, therefore, is the critical arbiter of success in such encounters — any improvements to the sensitivity, vigilance, reliability and speed of faculties for their detection would have been of significant selective advantage.’ The instinct could date back to early human evolution in Africa, where spiders with very strong venom existed millions of years ago.

"Keith Anderson attacked two men who he asked for a cigarette last year. He left one, an Army Lance Corporal, in a coma and severely brain damaged . A violent thug who ended a soldier's career with one punch because he wasn't given a cigarette has been jailed for seven years. Lance Corporal Albert Duffy had survived bomb blasts during a glittering military career which saw him complete three tours of war-ravaged Afghanistan. But after returning home to the UK, he was attacked at a bus stop by drink and drug-crazed Keith Anderson and left with severe brain damage. Just minutes before the attack, Anderson had punched another man, injuring him and leaving him incapable of work for a month. The 28-year-old thug 'bounced around, triumphantly like a boxer' after the assaults, a court heard this week. A judge was told the soldier had high hopes of progressing through the ranks, but is now unlikely to return to the military. Jailing Anderson for seven years at Teesside Crown Court this week, Recorder Patrick Palmer said: 'Albert Duffy was enjoying his career in the army. 'He was doing his bit for the United Kingdom and served abroad and served in combat and it seems highly unlikely he will return to his career. Your one punch destroyed that.' The court heard Anderson first attacked Adam Crosby at a bus stop in Hartlepool town centre on July 26 last year. He was angered that he only offered him the remainder of the cigarette he was smoking. Mr Crosby had to take a month off work at his family firm after he was left with a fractured cheek bone and damage to his teeth and nose. Anderson then walked to a nearby bus stop where L/Cpl Duffy was waiting and punched him to the ground after he failed to produce a cigarette. The soldier was left him slumped on the ground, bleeding from his ears and in a coma for 14 days. He sustained a fractured skull and needed two rounds of surgery after suffering haemorrhages, with part of his brain being removed. L/Cpl Duffy, from Darlington, County Durham, was a member of the 3 Rifles Infantry Battalion and had served in the Army for more than ten years, seeing colleagues killed and injured in Afghanistan. Teesside Crown Court heard Lance Corporal Albert Duffy's military career had been ruined by the attack . He escaped with his life in 2009 after a vehicle he was in hit an improvised explosive device. He was blown 15 feet into the air, but suffered only a broken foot. Since the attack, he has gone from one of the fittest in his battalion to a man who struggles to put together sentences, the court heard. He also has hearing problems and has little short-term memory, the judge was told. His mother, Marie Briggs, says she no longer recognises him as the caring son once looked up to by his seven siblings and her three-step children. In a statement to the court, L/Cpl Duffy said: 'I don't know what I'll do if I don't have the Army in my life and I have fought for my country. 'I find it difficult to comprehend how my life has been ruined by a male from Hartlepool, who punched me for no reason.' Fellow-victim Mr Crosby told the court: 'I'm 25, I should be enjoying myself, but this attack has had a massive affect on me.' Robin Turton, prosecuting, said when Anderson was arrested on July 30, he asked police: 'Is that me you're looking for in the paper' after seeing headlines as officers appealed for help. He also asked about the condition of one of the victims, but made no comment when he was interviewed. L/Cpl Duffy and the other victim, Adam Crosby, were set upon at a bus stop in Hartlepool in July last year . Mr Crosby's blood was found on clothing seized from Anderson's home in Hartlepool. Anderson admitted grievous bodily harm against Mr Crosby and grievous bodily harm with intent for the attack on L/Cpl Duffy. He was sentenced to two years for the attack on Mr Crosby and seven for the assault on L/Clp Duffy to run concurrently. Neil Mullarkey, mitigating, said Anderson had started to tackle his drink problem since he was remanded in custody. He added: 'He is disgusted with himself and thinks about what he has done every day and is ashamed.' The court heard that Anderson already has 19 convictions for 39 offences, including punching and head butting two women in a takeaway and an assault in which he used a pool ball in a sock to attack a man in a pub. But Recorder Mr Palmer stopped short of classifying him as a 'dangerous offender', which would have allowed the judge to jail Anderson indefinitely.","Soldier survived bomb blast in Afghanistan during 10-year Army career .

"The body of Andrew Getty, naked from the waist down, was discovered in a bathroom at his gated, three-storey £2.6 million villa in the Hollywood Hills on Tuesday afternoon. The Los Angeles neighbourhood is home to many of Tinseltown’s most powerful players, but Getty’s surname was all that was needed to ensure his entry into that social set. The 47-year-old grandson of John Paul Getty, once the world’s richest man, Andrew was an heir to the vast Getty oil fortune. Lurid early reports of his death and troubled past suggest a new chapter has opened in the tragic history of a family that epitomises, like no other, the saying that money doesn’t bring you happiness. Scroll down for video . Found dead: Andrew Getty, the 47-year-old grandson of John Paul Getty once the world’s richest man, was an heir to the vast Getty oil fortune . John Paul Getty, a misanthrope so tight-fisted he put a payphone in the hall of his Surrey mansion, failed disastrously in his quest to prevent his huge fortune spoiling his heirs. A string of Gettys have died from drug overdoses, while another grandson of the family patriarch, Jean Paul Getty III, never recovered after he became the victim of a notorious and brutal kidnapping. Other members of the supremely dysfunctional family became embroiled in decades long lawsuits and divorces, always over money. Even Andrew’s father, Gordon, a supposedly squeaky-clean married philanthropist and classical composer, was mired in scandal when it emerged he had a secret second family. In this latest tragedy, police say a woman called them to Andrew Getty’s home on Tuesday, saying that the horror movie buff had suffered a heart attack. Investigators say he had been having severe stomach problems and suffered significant bleeding in his rectal area. However, they believe he died of natural causes or an accident. Andrew Getty’s former girlfriend, identified in the U.S. media as aspiring actress Lanessa De Jonge, 32, raised the alarm. Reportedly she had told him to see a doctor about ‘painful bowel movements’. Andrew Getty’s former girlfriend, identified in the U.S. media as aspiring actress Lanessa De Jonge, 32, raised the alarm . Though investigators do not regard her as a suspect, she allegedly has a history of psychiatric problems and has been arrested a number of times for harassment and disorderly conduct. Reports in America suggest that according to police insiders, officers had previously been called to the house 31 times, usually over domestic disturbances. Lanessa and Andrew were frequently under the influence of drugs when officers visited. Then two weeks ago, Getty took out a restraining order against her, the Los Angeles police said yesterday. At the same time as he took out the order, he said he had a serious medical condition and that doctors had warned him that ‘heated arguments can cause my blood pressure to rise dangerously’, putting him at ‘serious risk’. Twelve years ago, when Getty was being sued over a disagreement with a former employee, he was portrayed in court by ex-colleagues on a film he directed as a threatening, cocaine-snorting gun nut. Educated at the private Dunn School in California, he later studied at New York University and the University of Southern California. Intriguingly, records show he has been prosecuted 12 times for unpaid taxes. In this latest tragedy, police say a woman called them to Andrew Getty’s home on Tuesday, saying that the horror movie buff had suffered a heart attack . The body of Andrew Getty, naked from the waist down, was discovered in a bathroom at his gated, three-storey £2.6 million villa in the Hollywood Hills on Tuesday afternoon . Andrew was the second eldest of four sons of Gordon Getty by his publisher wife, Ann. Gordon was the fourth son of the family patriarch J. Paul Getty, yet still Gordon assumed control of the $4billion family trust when his father died in 1976. J. Paul Getty married five times and produced six children, whom he treated with such disdain he never even bothered to attend their weddings. He became the world’s richest man when he struck oil in the Middle East in 1953. He reportedly showed affection for his youngest son, Timmy. But when he died aged 12 from a brain tumour, his father didn’t go to his funeral. Timmy’s mother claimed the tycoon had even complained about paying for his son’s medical treatment. His other sons fared little better. His eldest son and heir apparent, George, worked himself into an early grave trying to impress his father in the family business. He became so despairing at his failure that he would stab himself in the arms with a letter opener. He turned to drink and drugs, and died in 1973 after overdosing on pills. J. Paul Getty’s second son, Ronald, was virtually disinherited after his mother Adolphine — Getty’s third wife — dared to drag her feet over a divorce when the tycoon decided to move on to wife number four. John Paul Getty III (left) had his ear cut off by Italian mobsters after being held to ransom for a portion of his wealthy family's fortune - which his grandfather initially refused to pay.  Andrew Getty's father Gordon Getty (right) pictured in 1986, a decade before his secret family was revealed . John Paul Junior, the third boy, has gone down in history as the prodigal son. After a first job earning $100 a month as a petrol pump attendant, he joined the family business, but took to drinking heavily. He became a heroin addict soon after meeting his beautiful second wife, the Dutch actress and socialite Talitha Pol. They became darlings of the celebrity hippie set, partying with Mick Jagger and spending most of the Sixties in a druggie haze. When Talitha died of a heroin overdose in 1971, a devastated John Paul Junior holed himself up in his home in England. Unsurprisingly, he was cut off financially by his father, who intoned: ‘No Getty can be a drug addict.’ The shortage of funds proved tragic in 1973 when John Paul Junior’s oldest child, John Paul III, 16, was kidnapped in Rome by the Mafia. When a $17million ransom demand arrived, his skinflint grandfather refused to help. It was only after one of the boy’s ears was sent through the post that Getty coughed up and the hostage was released. Traumatised by his ordeal, the young John Paul Getty III slipped into cocaine and heroin addiction, washed down with a bottle of bourbon a day. John Paul Getty, a misanthrope so tight-fisted he put a payphone in the hall of his Surrey mansion, failed disastrously in his quest to prevent his huge fortune spoiling his heirs . In 1981, he suffered catastrophic liver failure and a severe stroke, emerging from six weeks in a coma virtually blind and paralysed from the neck down. He could communicate by little more than a high-pitched scream. He died aged 54 in 2011. Until now, Andrew Getty’s side of the family lived largely in comparative obscurity. After inheriting the family business empire, his father Gordon sold Getty Oil to Texaco for $10 billion in the mid-Eighties. He then settled in San Francisco to devote his life to philanthropy and his real passion: writing classical music. However, in 1999, he, too, plunged the Getty name into controversy after three previously secret children — then aged eight, ten and 14 — went to court to change their name to Getty. They and their mother, Cynthia Beck, it emerged, had been Gordon’s secret second family in Los Angeles, and the girls had decided to claim their birthright. His wife, Ann, had been aware for two years about the other family. Gordon and Ann’s second son, Andrew, meanwhile, had been trying with little success to become a film director. In 2003, Andrew was sued by a studio assistant, Ingrid Jacobs, for £500 in unpaid wages for his first and only film, a horror movie made in the house where he died this week. The court heard how Getty snorted cocaine, spent heavily on prostitutes and carried a gun — keeping an arsenal of assault rifles at his home and threatening the film crew with them. ‘All of us lived in fear of his dark, violent moods,’ said Ms Jacobs in court. ‘He once screamed at me: “I’m going to kick you in the kidneys so hard that you choke.” ‘He had no worries about spending thousands a week on high-price prostitutes, but he was mean as hell with everyone else.’ Charity Thomson, the movie’s assistant director, said she saw Getty snorting drugs while on the set. She described him as ‘a spoilt rich kid who doesn’t value his own life or that of anyone else’. Money never bought the family patriach J. Paul Getty love, a fact he belatedly acknowledged when he said he would have given half his kingdom for a happy marriage. Now, with another troubled Getty life cut short, his family would no doubt agree the money that brought them such luxury has also brought seemingly endless misery. As one commentator said: ‘They were born with golden ladles in their mouths, and they choked on them.’","Body of Andrew Getty found in a bathroom at his £2.6m villa on Tuesday .

Kyhesha-Lee was in the care of her father Matthew Lee Williamson and Christopher Arthur Neville Kent who have both been charged with manslaughter and child cruelty. Crown prosecutor Vicki Loury alleged the toddler also suffered a penetrative injury to her vagina three days before her death. She was not seen of or heard of by anyone else in the five days prior to her death, although another man visited the home the night before Kyhesha-Lee died. 'She was by that stage in severe distress, extremely unwell,' Ms Loury told the court. Kyhesha-Lee Joughin  was allegedly locked in a bedroom by her father, forcing her to defecate and urinate in the room . Kyhesha-Lee's body was found days after she suffered the blows - allegedly in squalid surroundings - at the unit she shared with her father in Petrie, north of Brisbane, on March 30, 2013. Kent, 46, was granted bail in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday after the court heard he'd offered to plead guilty on the basis of criminal negligence. Williamson allegedly locked his daughter in the bedroom while he slept during the day, forcing her to defecate and urinate in the room. Her father Matthew Lee Williamson and his friend Christopher Arthur Neville Kent, who also lived in the house and cared for the child in the days prior to her death, are each charged with manslaughter and child cruelty. They have both been released on bail . Evidence of the child's blood had been found on Kent's shorts. 'It was a small unit, he must have been aware of what was happening with the child,' Ms Loury said. Chief Magistrate Ray Rinaudo agreed with Kent's barrister Soraya Ryan that the accused no longer presented a risk of fleeing or re-offending on bail. Kyhesha-Lee's body was found - allegedly in squalid surroundings - at the unit she shared with her father in Petrie, north of Brisbane, on March 30, 2013 . Magistrate Rinaudo said he was ultimately swayed by Kent's steps towards taking responsibility for the 'tragic' events by his plea offer. Kent was bailed with strict conditions including daily reporting to police and restrictions on entering the homes of children under 16. Both he and Williamson are due to face a committal hearing next month.

"British agents spied on Argentina until 2011 over fears it would try to reclaim the Falklands Islands, former CIA worker Edward Snowden has claimed. Documents released by the American whistleblower allege Britain was actively spying on Argentina between 2006 and 2011. There has been no official response from Britain or Argentina to the claims, which were published by several Argentine news agencies. The documents include allegations Britain implanted computer viruses and circulated false propaganda to discredit the Argentine government, it has been reported. Documents released by Edward Snowden (pictured) claim Britain was spying on Argentina between 2006 and 2011, according to media reports there . The South American state still claims territorial rights to the islands, which they refer to as 'Malvinas' Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (right) pays tribute to the soldiers who died in the conflict during  the commemoration of the 33rd anniversary in Ushuaia last week . Snowden now lives in Russia having fled the US via Hong Kong after revealing extensive internet and phone surveillance by US intelligence. The revelations come in the wake of already heightened tensions with the discovery of oil in the Falklands by the British last week on what was the 33rd anniversary of the battle. Britain struck oil in the Falklands last week, a discovery likely to escalate tensions with Argentina. Above, troops walk across the island in 1982 . Britain has already pledged £180million over the next 10 years to beef up its defences of the Falklands to take into account 'any future and possible threats' to the islands. Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, leading to a conflict that cost 260 British and 650 Argentine lives. The South American state still claims territorial rights to the remote, wind-swept islands from Spain when it gained independence. Britain argues it has historically ruled the islands and the islanders should have the right to self-determination. In a 2013 referendum, 99.8 per cent voted to remain a British overseas territory. The row over the sovereignty of the islands, which Argentina calls Malvinas, could be intensified by Britain's oil find. After nine months of exploratory drilling, a group of British companies found oil and gas at the Zebedee exploratory well, in the north of the islands. The find, announced by British firms that share the exploration area (Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas), could be worth billions of pounds and will increase fears of renewed conflict over the British overseas territory. In a sign of worsening relations, Argentine foreign ministry officials say they will prosecute oil companies operating near the Falklands. The officials claim companies active there are operating illegally in Argentine territory. A war veteran and relatives sing the national anthem during a ceremony remembering the Argentine soldiers killed during the Falklands war in Buenos Aires . Argentina says it has a right to the islands, which it calls the Malvinas, because it inherited them from the Spanish crown in the early 1800s . Kirchner used the anniversary - commemorated in Argentina as the Day of the Veterans and Fallen of the Malvinas Islands War - to criticise Britain's announcement it will beef up its defence of the islands . Kirchner told the crowd: 'We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It's not just wishful thinking' The Argentine President poses with war veterans during the ceremony that paid tribute to fallen soldiers . Kirchner throws a rose into the water to honour the soldiers who fell during the 1982 Falklands conflict . The South American state still claims territorial rights to the remote, wind-swept islands from Spain when it gained independence . On April 2 1982, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, a remote UK colony in the South Atlantic. This led to a brief, but bitter conflict. Argentina's military junta hoped to restore its support at a time of economic crisis, by reclaiming sovereignty of the islands. It said it had inherited them from Spain in the 1800s and they were close to South America. The UK, which had ruled the islands  for 150 years, quickly chose to fight. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the 1,800 Falklanders were 'of British tradition and stock'. In the fighting that followed, 655 Argentine and 255 British servicemen lost their lives, as did three Falkland Islanders. In recent weeks, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has warned of a 'very live threat' from Buenos Aires. To stave off Argentinian aggression, he pledged to pump £180million into defending the islands over the next decade. The money will be spent on the upgrade of a surface-to-air missile system and the deployment of two Chinook helicopters. The commitment came after it was revealed earlier this year Russia could be helping to re-arm Argentina. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez condemned the move and said Britain should spend more helping its own poor instead. Delivering a speech to honour her country's war dead in the conflict, she said: 'What a paradox when there are more than one million Britons eating at the food banks they have had to open in one of the most powerful countries in the world. 'Don't worry. Don't spend another pound sterling on defending the Malvinas. 'Spend your money feeding the English, on providing jobs for your young people and a better quality of life for the British, because we are not a threat to anyone.' In a bold statement, she added: 'We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It's not just wishful thinking.' She has also ordered the declassification of all her country's secret documents on the war. Last year, the Top Gear cast and crew were chased out of Argentina by mobs angered by a H982 FKL licence plate on Jeremy Clarkson's Porsche. The host, who was recently sacked from his role at the BBC, feared 'lives were at stake' as he sheltered with fellow presenters James May and Richard Hammond while an angry gang of locals rampaged through the building looking for them. The BBC crew was hounded out of the country as locals claimed the controversial licence plate referred to the 1982 conflict, inflaming long-running tensions.","Snowden claimed Britain was spying on Argentina between 2006 and 2011 .

"A Manchester canal was turned into a giant bubble bath after fire crews tackling a nearby chemical plant blaze saw their water mix with a detergent creating a six foot wall of foam. The Ashton Canal was filled with heavy suds which appeared after a fire at an industrial unit occupied by a drug development company. It is believed that the water used by firefighters to dampen down the flames mixed with the detergent being stored in the burning buildings. Scroll down for video . The Ashton Canal in Manchester, which was turned into a giant bubble bath when fire crews tackled a blaze at a nearby chemical plant . It is believed that the water used by firefighters to dampen down the flames mixed with the detergent being stored in the burning buildings . Three-year-old Jason Kernick looks out of the window of his family's canal boat as they try to navigate their way through the foam . This then turned into a huge wall of foam when it drained into the canal, which runs in the shadow of Manchester City's Etihad Stadium. Now the Environment Agency have launched an investigation to assess if the foam has impacted on wildlife after concerns were raised for the safety of fish in the affected waters. A spokesman for the agency said: 'The Environment Agency is investigating after receiving reports of foam on a 30 metre stretch of the Ashton Canal, Manchester. 'Initial investigations by Environment Agency officers show that there appears to have been minimal impact on water quality, but our officers will continue to monitor and respond as necessary. Richard Kernick takes a picture on his mobile phone of his boat trying to negotiate a lock and the foam, which ran into the Ashton Canal . A cyclist takes a picture on his mobile phone as the foam comes up on to the cycle path. The Environment Agency are investigating to assess of the foam has harmed any wildlife . The foam reached as high as six foot in some places and covered a 30 metre stretch along the water in the Clayton area of Manchester . 'We are working with the fire service and taking samples of the foam to understand what it is made of, and what impact it may have on local wildlife in and around the canal.' At the height of the blaze on Sunday afternoon, which caused the foam, up to 50 firefighters were tackling the fire and police were also forced to wear face masks. Families in east Manchester were urged to say indoors after a blast was reported at the industrial unit, which is just a few hundred yards from the Manchester City training ground on the Etihad campus. The fire at the chemical factory next to Manchester City's Etihad stadium send a huge plume of smoke across the city on Easter Sunday . Police wearing face masks went around neighbouring streets with loudspeakers urging people to stay inside while the fire raged . Police officers also told children on bikes and mothers pushing prams near the scene to go home and went around neighbouring streets with loudspeakers urging people to stay inside. A huge plume of smoke also turned the sky black and could be seen right across the city and even into Salford. According to Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, the fire was fueled by wooden pallets and unidentified chemicals but an investigation into the cause of the fire is still ongoing.","The Ashton Canal became filled with heavy suds due to a 6ft wall of foam created by fire crews tackling a blaze .

"Mindy Kaling has denied knowing anything about her brother's controversial choice to reveal he pretended to be an African American to get into medical school. A representative for the comedienne told US Weekly she has been estranged from Vijay Chokal-Ingam 'for years' and claimed she 'was not aware of his decision to apply to medical school under a different name and race.' This comes as Chokal-Ingam, 38, admitted his sister has told him she is 'ashamed' of him for opening up about his alleged experience ahead of the release of his new book, Almost Black, in which he will describe how he gained admission to medical school in 1998 by transforming his appearance. Denial: Mindy Kaling has said she was not aware her brother pretended to be black when he applied to medical school in the late 1990s . 'My sister Mindy Kaling (Vera Mindy Chokalingam), of the Mindy Project and Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, strongly disapproves of my book,' he wrote. 'She actually said, 'This book will bring shame on our family'. The rest of my family does not agree with the book. Still, they respect my right to make my own decisions with my career,' he added. Chokal-Ingam says on his blog that he felt he had to change his appearance to get into the St. Louis University School of Medicine and heavily attacks affirmative action policies in the United States. 'I was determined to become a doctor and I knew that admission standards for certain minorities under affirmative action were, let's say… less stringent?' wrote Chokal-Ingam. 'I got into medical school because I said I was black. The funny thing is I'm not.' He claims in 1998 he shaved his head, trimmed his 'long Indian eyelashes' and joined the Organization of Black Students during the process. Controversial claims: On his website, AlmostBlack.com, Chokal-Ingam shows side-by-side qualifications and pictures of himself as an Indian-American man (left) and a black man (right). He doesn't specify if he went through the same application process as an Indian-American man as he did as a black man . His change in appearance was 'so startling that my own fraternity brothers didn't recognize me'. 'Vijay the Indian-American frat boy became Jojo the African American Affirmative Action applicant to medical school,' he said, claiming that Jojo was the middle name he was born with. As an Indian-American with a GPA of 3.1, MCAT of 31 and a member of the South Asian Student Association, he didn't think he'd get into medical school, but with a change of appearance and switch of student organization, he thought he could get into some of the top schools in the nation. 'I became a serious contender at some of the greatest medical schools in America, including Harvard, Wash U, UPenn, Case Western, and Columbia,' he said about the application process. 'In all, I interviewed at eleven prestigious medical schools in 9 major cities across America, while posing a black man,' he added. Despite his startling claims, Chokal-Ingam fails to mention if he applied to the same schools at the same time as an Indian-American man. He also does not seem to appear repentant about presumably taking a place at college that would otherwise could have gone to another person. When he was finally accepted to St. Louis University School of Medicine, he used the acceptance to claim he was only granted admission because he was black and used the situation as an example of what was 'wrong' with affirmative action. Indeed, Chokal-Ingam admits that he did not even complete his medical degree and dropped out before he qualified as a doctor. Chokal-Ingam also admits he found posing as a black person to be socially fascinating. Success: Mindy Kaling (pictured left in August 2014 in LA and right in April 2014 in New York) is the star of her own sitcom The Mindy Project . 'Not everything worked out as planned,' he wrote on his website. 'Cops harassed me. Store clerks accused me of shoplifting. Women were either scared of me or couldn't keep their hands off me. What started as a devious ploy to gain admission to medical school turned into a twisted social experiment.' And unsurprisingly, Chokal-Ingam has been at the end of a huge backlash following his contentious claims. The Daily Beast claims that though his experience 'revealed inherent cultural bigotries that feed systematic racism', Chokal-Ingam didn't bring everything he could to the table. 'He chooses to sidestep, downplay, or flat-out ignore how the same racism that led to him being harassed by cops and store clerks keeps black applicants on the fringes of elite educational institutions for generations,' Stereo Williams wrote. 'It's easier for him to tap dance for the right wing as the brown man who 'gets it', while conveniently missing how ongoing racism makes affirmative action absolutely necessary,' he added. And though he claims he became a serious contender at schools across the nation as a black man, he doesn't specify if he went through the application process as an American-Indian man. 'Chokal-Ingam seems to have assumed that he would've gotten nowhere as an Indian American applicant and dove head first into this poorly-conceived 'experiment' before determining otherwise,' Williams wrote. And more so, Williams claims that Chokal-Ingam's experiment 'is insulting to what black people endure in this country, both institutionally and culturally'. Williams claims: 'And as a person of color, it's irresponsible for him to be so invested in the idea of individual exceptionalism that he ignores structural inadequacies. 'Black people can't be as 'racist' as whites societally, Mr. Chokal-Ingam. You didn't spend your time applying to black colleges in the hopes of finding work as a doctor in black-owned and operated hospitals. 'And a major reason why you were in a position to be considered for entry into any white institution is because black people generations before you made that possible through sacrifice and hard work. 'The attempt to undermine their work for the sake of promoting false 'equality' is truly regrettable. But when you conduct social 'experiments' that cite C. Thomas Howell's Soul Man as an inspiration, it's obvious that you don't take these issues all that seriously.'","Comedienne Mindy Kaling, 35, says she did not know about her brother's decision to apply to medical school posing as an African American .

"Soaring immigration means most parts of the country could have fewer available primary school places than pupils in just two years. Pressure on the education system has intensified following a baby boom and continued migration, forcing schools to boost class sizes and add classrooms. The Local Government Association warned they may not be able to create more places at the rate that is needed. Pressure on the education system has intensified following a baby boom and continued migration, forcing schools to boost class sizes and classrooms - but say they may not be able to continue doing so . Its analysis of official figures indicates that by September next year, two in five local authorities in England will have more children ready to start school than there are places. This will increase to more than half by 2017/18 and to three in five by the following year. It comes after the head of Ofsted Sir Michael Wilshaw warned last year that schools were struggling to cope with growing numbers of migrant pupils. ‘When they’re faced with an influx of children from other countries, they need the resources and capacity to deal with it and if those resources aren’t there, that’s a big issue for government,’ he said. In 2013, a leaked paper prepared by the Department for Education revealed a steady increase in the number of babies being born has helped fuel the crisis. The LGA said that councils have created more than 300,000 primary school places since May 2010, with many increasing class sizes. Money set aside for school repair programmes has been diverted into converting areas such as music rooms into classrooms. The Local Government Association warned they may not be able to create more places at the rate needed . But the association warned the situation is reaching a ‘tipping point’ and made a fresh call for an incoming government to hand councils enough cash and fresh powers to open new schools and establish more places. It comes as parents brace themselves for ‘primary school offers day’ later this month, when councils will tell families whether they secured their first choice of school. Last year, research based on an LGA report found an extra 130,000 primary places would be needed across the country within three years. Many parts of the country saw a rise in applications last year and up to four in ten children were denied admission to their chosen primary schools. David Simmonds, the chairman of the LGA’s children and young people board, said: ‘Mums and dads rightly expect their child to be able to get a school place where they live. ‘But our fear is that we will reach a tipping point when councils or schools cannot afford the massive cost of creating places or find the space necessary for new classes.’ Yesterday, Labour seized on the predictions to attack the Coalition’s free schools programme, claiming that it was creating extra places in areas where they were not needed. Labour’s education spokesman Tristram Hunt said: ‘David Cameron’s crisis in school places is yet more evidence the Tory plan is failing children and working families. ‘Make no mistake, his decision to plough hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ money on free schools into areas where there are no shortages of school places comes at the expense of the families in the areas where there is a desperate need.’ According to the LGA, no areas currently have more pupils than places, as councils in oversubscribed parts of the country have managed to create enough slots. Of the more than half of areas expected to have more pupils than places by 2017/18, the worst hit will be in London and the South East. Unless action is taken, the LGA estimates that Harrow in North West London will have 122 pupils for every 100 places, while Newham in East London will have 120 and Reading will have 114. The worst-hit areas are those which tend to be popular with both young families and migrants. 'Human right': Play can help children develop socially . Children should be allowed to learn through playing in the classroom until they reach the age of seven, a union says. Many pupils are not ready to sit down to do formal reading, writing and maths when they start school, according to the National Union of Teachers. Instead the union is expected to call for ‘play in the curriculum’ throughout infant schools, at its annual conference this weekend. The union is also due to raise the issue of lunch and break times, which it believes are being used for ‘coaching and cramming’ too often. Members believe this deprives youngsters of their ‘fundamental human right to play’ and socialise with their classmates. Instead, schools should follow the lead of countries such as Finland and introduce 45-minute lessons immediately followed by 15-minute playtimes, the teachers said. A resolution due to be put forward at the conference tomorrow says: ‘Primary schools are now being driven more and more towards a test and accountability culture which in turn makes them drive children of primary age to be educated in a formal way.’ It goes on to suggest that learning through play is known to help youngsters develop vital communication and social skills and that ‘over-formalisation of learning can cause disaffection with school’. Speaking ahead of the conference, NUT general secretary Christine Blower said many children are not ready for the ‘formal, sitting down, “come on let’s do some work” stage’ before they are seven. ‘There is a question about whether we’re expecting children to do things they’re not developmentally ready for,’ she said. The resolution comes amid growing debate over what children should learn, with politicians and education experts increasingly calling for schools to instil and teach values and abilities such as character, teamwork and resilience alongside academic subjects.","Pressure on education intensified following baby boom and migration .

"A New Zealand couple needed a home upon returning home after living in the UK, so they built one on the back of an old flatbed truck. Hannah and Alex purchased a 1986 Hino flatbed and undertook their year and a half labor of love. The result was a solar-powered two-bedroom, wood and steel home that now allows them to live almost self-sufficiently in Nelson, New Zealand. How a truck becomes a home: A New Zealand couple built this country home on the bed of a flatbed truck . Making do: Alex (left) and Hannah (right) wanted a home that was cozy and all their own, but couldn't afford to buy a full-sized lot . 'We came back to New Zealand from the UK in 2009,' Alex told Smoking Tire. 'We knew we couldn't afford to buy property at that point. We didn't have money.' So, the couple started building. After a year and a half of taking the project one step at a time, the project took shape. Though, to hear Hannah tell it, they just slapped up the place in a weekend. '[We] welded a frame, put the wood on and built this house,' the modest Kiwi told Smoking Tire's Matt Farah. Once they finished, the couple drove their truck home out to a lot they'd purchased in Nelson, New Zealand. Now the couple and their cat live surrounded by nature: aromatic cypress wood inside the home and majestic trees and a babbling brook outside their door. Ingenuity: The couple started with a steel frame and slowly, project by project, built a home in about a year and a half . Gorgeous: Hannah and Alex now have a gorgeous, wood-lined home in a lot surrounded by trees and a babbling brook . Details: The couple has a wood-fired stove to keep out the cold, stained glass windows and other creature comforts . They're nearly self-sufficient, too. The home is powered mostly by solar panels. Alex said their first power bill was just $25. The stove and hot water are gas-powered and water comes from a nearby spring. 'I didn't want to live inside a plastic box,' Alex said. 'Not because I'm a hippie but because it feels nicer and is just a nicer place to be.' All told, the project cost Hannah and Alex about $25,000. And the couple even plans to build another one like one day. 'It's really, really nice,' Hannah said. 'We love it.' Two bedrooms: The home has a bedroom for the couple as well as a loft that doubles as a spare room where the cat sleeps .

"Sitting in a restaurant with friends, Teresa James pushed food longingly around her plate, desperate to eat but unable to stand the pain it would cause. Her mouth felt as if it were on fire, her gums were beginning to blister and her teeth had grown so sensitive that she knew that if so much as a sip of water came into contact with them she would wince. But Teresa’s agony was tempered with pride, because when she did manage to summon a smile, it was the most dazzling at her table. Teresa James, 40 (pictured), believes the discomfort involved with teeth whitening is worth it for the end result of a bright smile . She had spent four hours earlier that afternoon bleaching her teeth and, as far as she was concerned, the considerable discomfort was worth it. ‘Whitening has been unbearably painful at times,’ says Teresa, 40. ‘But I am obsessive about having a bright smile.’ Teresa’s regimen may sound somewhat masochistic, but she is one of an increasing number of women for whom whitening their teeth has become an integral part of their beauty routine — as normal as colouring their hair or waxing their legs. In America, sales of tooth whitening products have risen 300 per cent since 1996, and the trend for excessive bleaching has grown so commonplace there that dentists have coined a new word for it — ‘bleachorexia’. Symptoms include burning gums, tooth infection and the conviction that, no matter how much a tooth has been whitened, it could be paler still. Perhaps predictably, it has caught on in Britain. Almost a third of Britons are now preoccupied with whitening their teeth, and research this week revealed the highest-earning cosmetic dentists made a collective turnover of £1 billion last year — a 22 per cent increase from 2010. ‘When it is done properly, tooth whitening is a simple and safe way of improving your appearance,’ says cosmetic dentist Dr Mervyn Druian. ‘But if it is performed in an unregulated fashion, with the wrong product, it can cause enamel erosion, receding gums and infection.’ Tessa (pictured) is part of a growing group of women for whom teeth whitening has become an integral part of their beauty regime . Teresa, a banking finance officer from London, started whitening her teeth five years ago, influenced by the brilliant smiles of celebrities she admired. ‘My own teeth looked grey in comparison after years of caffeinated drinks and they were affecting my confidence,’ she says. The active ingredient in most professional whitening products is hydrogen peroxide, in gel form. In October 2012, an EU council directive made it illegal in Britain to use hydrogen peroxide — which can cause sensitivity and burning when applied too often or at too high a dose — in concentrations above 6 per cent, and decreed any concentration over 0.1 per cent could be administered only by a dental professional. When carrying out the procedure, a dentist makes a mould of the patient’s teeth from which a special tray is constructed. Hydrogen peroxide gel is then squirted on to the tray via a syringe, and the tray fitted over the teeth and left for 45 minutes. Teresa (pictured) started whitening her teeth five years ago having been influenced by the brilliant smiles of celebrities she admired . Usually, the first treatment is carried out at the surgery, then the patient is given syringes and the tray to use at home — 45 minutes a day, for a fortnight, being the norm. The treatment normally costs up to £500, so when Teresa spotted a DIY whitening kit online for £17.99, she was tempted. It looked authentic enough: a silicone tray and five syringes of bleach. Teresa isn’t sure how strong this hydrogen peroxide was, or indeed even if it was hydrogen peroxide. But the tray had to be moulded to her teeth — by softening in boiling water first — then worn overnight. That’s when the warning bells should have sounded, says Dr Druian: ‘Trays should always be properly fitted by a dentist otherwise they will never fit well and can cause leakage, which irritates gums.’ Lisa Arbiter (pictured) has been bulk-buying high-strength bleach from America to whiten her teeth every month for the past 13 years . Sure enough, the minute Teresa put the tray on, her gums started to tingle. ‘I just assumed it meant it was working,’ she says. Keen to go whiter than white, she kept the bleach on for an hour — another mistake, says Dr Druian. ‘After 45 minutes out of the syringe, hydrogen peroxide loses effectiveness. More time won’t make your teeth whiter, it will just lead to irritation and sensitivity. And if you have decay in your teeth, it can enter and lead to infection.’ But Teresa was so delighted with the initial results that she used her whitening kit once a week, leaving it on for longer each time. By the time she had reached her last syringe, she was bleaching for up to four hours at a time. Lisa (pictured) was just 19 when she first tried bleaching her teeth, she now says it's addictive and she'll carry on doing it for ever . ‘My teeth were so weak and sensitive I worried they were going to fall out. I was in agony. I knew I was being irrational, but having white teeth had become a part of my identity. It was only after an evening of not being able to eat and waiting for days for my swollen gums to go down that I realised I’d gone too far.’ So Teresa invested in whitening toothpastes, a whitening powder and a whitening pen instead. Ironically, the changes made to the law in 2012, which were supposed to protect patients’ dental health, have seen a flood of illegal DIY whitening products on to the market, alongside unqualified practitioners who cater for those — like Teresa — who can’t afford a dentist’s whitening service. ‘There has been an upsurge in beauticians whitening teeth with unregulated materials,’ says Dr Druian. ‘Many use chlorine dioxide — a strong antibacterial chemical sometimes found in swimming pools — which is easier to get hold of, given the Government’s restrictions on hydrogen peroxide. Lisa (pictured) buys £50 boxes of syringes of a 25 per cent solution from the U.S and insists she has no pain or side effects from the treatment . ‘At a high concentration, this can burn gums, leading to receding, and make tooth enamel rough and porous, which leaves it prone to further staining — trapping users into a vicious cycle of whitening.’ Natasha Crane, from Norwich, is suffering from suspected enamel erosion after having her teeth whitened, for £30, by a beautician operating illegally. She had seen an advert on Facebook. Unknown to Natasha, aged 17, she is a year under the legal age limit for teeth whitening, but the beautician didn’t check. ‘She painted the whitening gel on with cotton wool,’ remembers Natasha. ‘It didn’t feel professional or hygienic, but this was my first experience of tooth whitening.’ As soon as the beautician removed the gel an hour later, and Natasha rinsed her mouth, her teeth felt agonisingly sensitive. Newlywed Donna Bilson (pictured) is a recent convert to tooth bleaching but is already very taken with it . ‘The beautician said this was normal,’ she recalls. ‘When the pain didn’t go away over the next few days I called her back, but she still said there was nothing to worry about.’ After later discovering that her beautician had been operating illegally, she reported her to the General Dental Council — the regulatory body for British dentists. Since then, Natasha’s teeth have grown more painful. ‘They’re so sensitive that it hurts when they come into contact with fresh air,’ she says. ‘I have to wear a scarf over my mouth outdoors. Eating is agony and I drink through a straw.’ Meanwhile, her teeth are starting to turn yellow because the dentine that is underneath the enamel is becoming exposed. ‘Not only am I in pain, but, ironically, my teeth have never looked worse,’ says Natasha. Beauticians practising illegally are not the only problem, however. Increasing numbers of women are ordering industrial-strength hydrogen-peroxide whitening products online from the U.S., where there are no legal limits on levels. Donna (pictured) and her husband, Andy, both started bleaching their teeth before they got married last October . Lisa Arbiter, 33, has been bulk-buying high-strength bleach from America to whiten her teeth every month for the past 13 years. She was 19 and working as a beauty therapist when she first tried it. She buys £50 boxes of syringes of a 25 per cent solution from the U.S., yet insists she has no side-effects other than sensitive teeth. ‘At work, having white teeth makes me look more professional,’ she says. ‘And having so many pictures of ourselves plastered on social media makes it obvious who has whitened their teeth and who hasn’t. Un-whitened teeth look dirty. ‘Tooth whitening is addictive, and I’ll carry on bleaching mine for ever.’ According to the British Dental Health Foundation the effects of professional whitening can last for up to three years. Although her husband stopped after their wedding, Donna (pictured) has carried on and says its part of her beauty routine now . But newlywed Donna Billson — a recent convert to tooth bleaching — is already hooked on doing it far more frequently than that. Donna and her husband Andy, 34, started whitening their teeth last January in the run-up to their wedding last October. ‘We wanted to look our best in the pictures,’ says Donna, 36, a HR manager from Birmingham. They ordered £55 boxes of 20 whitening strips — fabrics impregnated with 6 per cent hydrogen peroxide gel that users stick to their teeth for 45 minutes — from the States. ‘Andy stopped after our wedding and says I don’t need to whiten my teeth any more either,’ says Donna. ‘But I’ll carry on. It’s as much a part of my beauty routine as having my hair coloured and legs waxed.’","Teresa James, 40, believes the pain involved is worth it for a bright smile .

"A pregnant woman was saved after her partner dived under the capsized boat they were in to retrieve an emergency flare. The woman had been left in the water clinging to the hull of their overturned trimaran in the English Channel yesterday. Her partner had ensured she was safe, then tied a rope around himself, before diving under the vessel to locate the flare. The pregnant woman and her partner (pictured waiting to be rescued) were stranded off the coast of Kent after their trimaran overturned yesterday . The alarm was raised after a man spotted the couple in the water a mile from Dungeness Point, Kent, at 3.30pm – and a rescue boat was sent to help them. The HM Customs cutter Valiant, which was on the water nearby, and was able to locate the upturned vessel within minutes and spotted a red flare. A Coastguard spokesman said that the cutter stood by the vessel, ensuring the safety of those in the water, until an RNLI lifeboat from Dungeness arrived to pick the couple up from the water and take them ashore. They were taken to the William Harvey Hospital by the rescue helicopter from RAF Watisham. The spokesman said the pair were 'cold and shaken by the ordeal' but unharmed. The alarm was raised after a man spotted the couple in the water a mile from Dungeness Point, Kent . Bob Giles, Dover Coastguard Watch Manager said: 'The couple were thrown into the water after their vessel capsized. 'Both were wearing lifejackets and the man ensured that his partner was safe, then tied a rope around himself and dived under the vessel to retrieve a flare so that he could alert rescuers to their position. 'Because they had AIS (automatic identification system) on board they were easy to locate and so were rescued quickly. 'The member of the public who made the first call to the Coastguard did exactly the right thing by calling 999 and asking for the Coastguard. It meant that we were able to get rescuers to the scene within minutes of the vessel capsizing.'","Woman had been left clinging to the hull of overturned trimaran yesterday .

"China have said they are to start tracking the actions of their citizens abroad, following a string of reports about behaviour abroad. The China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) said on its website on Monday that provincial and national authorities will be in touch with unruly citizens when they return to China, and if necessary, the police, customs officers, border control and even bank credit agencies will be contacted. They are hoping the strict measures will encourage Chinese tourists from doing anything inappropriate or illegal while abroad.

A group of Chinese travellers who scalded a flight attendant with hot water and noodles and threatened to blow up a plane. The passengers lashed out at cabin crew after they became enraged over sitting arrangements on a charter flight from Bangkok to Nanjing . According to China People's Daily, bad behaviour will include: disorder on public transportation－including flights－damaging public facilities or historical relics, ignoring social customs at tourism destinations, and becoming involved with gambling or prostitution. Research by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that there were 109 million Chinese tourists in 2014, who spent $164 billion. These figures are a dramatic increase from the 10 million outbound tourists in 2000, and reflected the rise in numbers of reports on disruptive behaviour. It has been suggested that higher incomes have attributed to more Chinese citizens opting to spend their holidays outside of their country. The CNTA administration said in a separate post: 'tourism reflects on the country and the people's image,' and more 'social supervision' of tourists is needed.

"Police searched an area near a Ford Motor Company plant in Michigan on Sunday for clues related to the disappearance of a woman who was last seen at Halloween wearing a Poison Ivy costume . Chelsea Ellen Bruck, 22, has been missing almost six months, police said. Monroe County Sheriff's Major Jeff Kemp reported that the search was arranged after investigators received a tip from a citizen about the area in Flat Rock. 'All I can say … is we're looking for evidence,' the sheriff's office said. He declined to discuss media reports that part of Chelsea's costume were found. Scroll down for video . A new search was conducted on Sunday in the case of missing Chelsea Ellen Bruck, 22, who was last seen dressed as Batman villain Poison Ivy at a Halloween party on October 25 attended by around 800 people . Miss Bruck, 22, from Maybee has not been seen since the early hours of October 26, 2014 despite extensive searches on foot and by helicopter to locate her . The Maybee woman was dressed as the comic villain Poison Ivy when she attended a Halloween party October 26 in Frenchtown Township. The costume included a leaf-covered top and dark purple wig. That was the last time she was seen at the outdoor party at a rural farmhouse which was attended by around 800 people, 35 miles southwest of Detroit. Her mother, Leannda Bruck, told AP that detectives were actively working on the case but declined to say anything else. Sheriff's deputies and Flat Rock police conducted the search on Sunday night focusing on an area near the Flat Rock Assembly Plant. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from the Flat Rock police department on Monday. Jennifer Bruck, left, prays for sister Chelsea with parents Matt and Leannda Bruck and other family and friends who turned to public prayer in Monroe, Michigan last October. She has not been seen for six months . Police have interviewed multiple people and investigated hundreds of tips over the past six months. A witness reported seeing Miss Bruck walking about 3am with a man as the party was winding down.The sheriff's office published a sketch of the man she was seen with in a parking lot. The dark-haired man had thin stubble and wore glasses with a black hoodie. The man has not been identified and police have not named him as a suspect. Two were charged separating for telling police lies about the missing woman. In a missing person appeal, Chelsea Bruck is described as 5'7' tall, 140lbs, blonde, with a small anchor tattoo behind her right ear. She was last seen wearing black yoga pants, a black wig and a leaf-covered vest. Anyone with information about the case is asked to call the Monroe County Sheriff's Office at (734) 240-7700 or Monroe County Central Dispatch at (734) 243-7070. Authorities released this sketch of the man Miss Bruck was seen with in a parking lot around 3am following a party in Frenchtown Township, Michigan just before Halloween . Her sister, Kassandra Bruck, 24, told the Detroit Free Press last year that the family is encouraging people to share photos of Chelsea - across Michigan and beyond. She told NBC: 'This is 100% uncharacteristic, it's not anything she would do. She even told my mom, ''I'm not staying long. I'll be back in a couple of hours.'' This has just broken my parents.' Ms Bruck told CBS on Monday that she was 'very hopeful' her sister would be found alive. The party host Mike Williams, 30, told the paper he had been forced to close the party, intended for 500 people, after around 800 revelers turned up. He added that he hadn't seen Miss Bruck at the party at all. A GoFundMe campaign to help find Miss Bruck has raised close to $9,000.

"Most mothers dream of their children's birthdays, graduations and weddings. But Jodie Barden has the heartbreaking task of arranging both her daughters' funerals, knowing that neither will make adulthood because of an incredibly rare illness. Mrs Barden, 28, is mother to eight-year-old Ella and one-year-old Chloe, who both suffer from Cockayne Syndrome and have a life expectancy of just 12. Cockayne Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder, which is characterised by a failure to gain weight, premature ageing, an underdeveloped nervous system and a small head. Scroll down for video . Jodie Barden, 28, has been forced to plan her daughters Ella, eight (left) and Chloe, one (right)'s funerals as they have rare genetic disorder Cockayne Syndrome which gives them a life expectancy of just 12 . In 2013, Mrs Barden shaved her head in order to raise money for a Cockayne Syndrome charity. She is pictured here with daughter Ella, who ages prematurely due to the syndrome . Sufferers usually don't live to see their teenage years and usually die from pneumonia. Given her children's prognosis, Mrs Barden has already made arrangements for both daughters' funerals with her husband, Luke, who is also 28. The former graphic designer, who is now the girls' full-time carer, said: 'There's no cure for what they have and there's not much the doctors can say, so we just try and keep them comfortable while they're with us. 'They'll eventually lose their sight and hearing and, when that time comes, we want to be able to provide them with somewhere where they can still have fun.' The condition causes premature ageing, so despite the fact the girls are seven years apart, they look like they are a similar age. Ella currently has a tremor, which makes drinking from a beaker difficult, and she only says words like 'yes' and 'juice'. Chloe isn't walking yet and probably won't ever reach this milestone. But while they cannot speak, Mrs Barden said they do not fail to communicate their desires through gesturing. She said: 'They are both such good fun - real cheeky monkeys.' She describes the moment she was told her children had the disease as 'devastating'. Cockayne syndrome (CS) is very rare disease resulting in slow growth in babies as well as rapid aging (a form of progeria). People with this syndrome have smaller than normal head sizes, are of short stature, their eyes appear sunken, and they have an 'aged' look. It is estimated to affect one in 500,000 children but difficult to diagnose. For CS patients who are affected at birth, life expectancy is 3–7 years. Other patients only start to show symptoms in early childhood and their life expectancy tends to be under 20 years. However, some rare CS patients live significantly longer. Individuals with CS are extremely sensitive to the sunlight and sunburn easily so they mostly stay indoors during normal daylight hours. CS is often described as a 'progeria-like syndrome'. Progeria is an extremely rare genetic disease wherein symptoms resembling aspects of aging are manifested at an early age. One of the earliest influences of progeria on popular culture occurred in the 1922 short story The Curious Case of Benjamin Button by F. Scott Fitzgerald (and later released as a feature film in 2008 staring Brad Pitt). The main character, Benjamin Button, is born as a seventy-year-old man and ages backwards; a scenario inspired by progeria. She said: 'Ella was diagnosed at Great Ormond Street in 2012 when we noticed she wasn't hitting her milestones; when she didn't start talking when we expected her to. 'I was pregnant with Chloe at the time and that's when we found out she would be born with the same disease. 'It was devastating, but once we got over the shock we decided we would do all that we could to make their lives memorable.' The disease is inherited and Mrs Barden and her husband, a HGV driver, both carry the mutated gene. They have a one-in-four chance of conceiving a child with Cockayne Syndrome, whereas the odds are usually two in a million. Now, she and her husband are trying to make the most of the time they have with their daughters, as well as their four-year-old son Alex, who does not suffer from the disease. Mrs Barden said her son is 'fantastic' with his sisters. She said: 'He's genuinely loving and has a very caring nature. 'If either of the girls drops something on the floor he will just pick it up without being asked. 'We will always be honest with him. 'The girls are always happy and never moan, they keep smiling despite everything they've been through.' She added that her husband is incredibly supportive, and the whole extended family have helped them through a difficult time. She said: 'It's a test of anyone's relationship, but luckily Luke and I have always been very close. 'We're also lucky to have support from both sides of the family.' They have collectively raised around £14,000 for charity Amy and Friends, a Cockayne Syndrome charity based in Liverpool. This was done through a series of events including skydiving and hosting coffee mornings. Mrs Barden even shaved off her hair in January 2013. And in the same year, Ella, who uses a wheelchair and walking frame to get around, appeared on a special episode of The Jeremy Kyle Show for Mother's Day. Mrs Barden said the whole family is now trying to make the most of the time they have left with the girls. Her son, Alex, four, is 'fantastic' with his sisters, she said . The reality television presenter paid for her to dress up like a princess and climb the Eiffel Tower. And last year, they flew to Melbourne and the Gold Coast in Australia where Ella swam with dolphins. Mrs Barden said: 'We met up with another family with Cockayne Syndrome over Facebook. Essex charity, Wipe Away Those Tears, is sending the family to Disneyland Paris for an Easter holiday. In the meantime, Mrs Barden is taking on a Tough Mudder event in September. Her ambition is to raise enough money to kit out a special sensory shed at their home in Witham, Essex. She said: 'The sensory shed is basically just a big playhouse in the garden where they can interact with twinkly lights and feel different objects.'","Jodie Barden's daughters Ella, 8 and Chloe, 1, have Cockayne Syndrome .

"The Tories have accused Labour of a crude new attempt to 'weaponise' the NHS by orchestrating a letter from doctors claiming hospitals will not be safe if David Cameron wins the election. Ed Miliband was also accused of hypocrisy after he claimed that the Coalition had made it harder to get a GP appointment. Mr Miliband claimed there were now 600 fewer GP surgeries open during evenings and weekends than before the previous election – which he said was directly contributing to the A&E crisis. Scroll down for video . Labour launched a poster declaring 'the Tories have made it harder to see a GP' but critics were quick to point out that the figures were out of date . His comments came after Labour launched a poster declaring 'the Tories have made it harder to see a GP'. But critics were quick to point out that his figures were out of date – and that the GP crisis is widely blamed on Labour's GP contracts, which allowed them to opt out of out-of-hours care. Meanwhile it emerged last night that a Labour-supporting GP had circulated a letter claiming that 'five years of flat-line funding' have 'crippled the NHS'. A version of the letter – organised by Dr Clare Gerada, the former chairman of the Royal College of GPs – appeared in the Guardian signed by more than 100 doctors last night. It claimed the 'direction of travel' under the Tories was towards privatisation, adding: 'Another five years of Tory austerity will sap staff morale and reduce the NHS to a poor service for poor people'. Labour were accused of orchestrating the letter as a 'stitch up'. Conservative MP Julian Smith said: 'This Labour stitch up is another desperate attempt to weaponise the NHS. 'Under this government, we've got more doctors, more nurses and more patients being seen than ever before.' In an email obtained by the Tories, Dr Gerada said signatures were being collected to 'counter' the 100 business leaders who wrote a Tory-supporting letter to a national paper last week. Mr Miliband claimed there were now 600 fewer GP surgeries open during evenings and weekends than before the previous election – which he said was directly contributing to the A&E crisis . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has promised to give NHS chiefs 'whatever they need' after the election. Mr Hunt yesterday claimed a Conservative government would find whatever money the health service said was required to cope with the growing pressure on hospitals and GP surgeries. The apparently open-ended commitment will raise eyebrows at a time when public spending is under increasing pressure. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens has said the health service needs an extra £8billion a year by 2020 just to keep standards as they are. The Tories have pledged to find huge public spending cuts, and every pound spent on the NHS means less for other priorities such as education and defence. Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'We will back the NHS's own plan in full ... We will give whatever they need, it might be more than £8billion, it might be less.' Dr Gerada said she was a member of the Labour party but not an 'activist' and said the letter had been organised independently. She told the Telegraph: 'It has not been orchestrated by Labour, it has been put together by me and a few other medical leaders.' The Tories say that at least two of the signatories are Labour supporters, including one who tried to stand as a Labour candidate and another who has previously spoken at the Labour Party conference. The signatories, including Professor John Ashton, retired director of public health, and Simon Capewell, professor of public health in Liverpool, wrote that the NHS 'is withering away'. They said 'if things carry on as they are then in future people will be denied care they once had under the NHS and have to pay more for health services.' Meanwhile, as figures yesterday revealed that A&E waiting times are the longest since records began in 2004/05, Mr Miliband said: 'One of the reasons for that is it's got a lot harder to see a GP. 'Across England there are some 600 fewer GP surgeries open in the evenings and at weekends than there were at the last general election.' But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Labour's 'shoddy figures are not only wrong but also expose Labour's rank hypocrisy over GP access'. Mr Hunt said the figures quoted only go up to 2013/14 and that since then, the Conservatives' extended hours scheme, announced last year, has covered 1,100 practices and helped 7.5million patients see GPs in the evenings and at weekends. He said by next year the scheme will cover 1,400 additional practices, serving 10 million more people. He added: 'The next Conservative Government will deliver a truly seven-day NHS, putting right a problem which began with Labour's disastrous 2004 GP contract.' Mr Hunt said the contract had allowed GPs to opt out of responsibility for their patients out of hours. He added that far from cutting funding, the Tories would give the NHS 'whatever it needs' if the party wins the election. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg accused Labour of 'making cheap political points using outdated statistics'. 'It's pretty rich coming from a party that blew £12billion on an NHS super computer,' he said. Mr Clegg also described shadow health secretary Andy Burnham as 'a slightly sort of cardboard cut out, a rather sort of silly Labour politician.' Medical leaders also criticised Labour's claims yesterday. GP Mike Dixon, chairman of the NHS Alliance, said: 'Labour's poster is not fair. 'Patient access to extended hour services hasn't got worse, as these figures ignore the Prime Minister's new scheme.' Chris Leslie, shadow Treasury minister, said the figures were the latest available. Following the letter from 100 doctors claiming the NHS is not safe in Tory hands, Labour is today expected to launch a fresh attack over the health service. JAMES SLACK sifts the claims from the reality. CLAIM: There are 590 fewer GP surgeries open at evenings and weekends compared to Labour's last year in office . REALITY: Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham is using figures which compare July 2009 to the year ending April 2014 - which means they are a full year out of date. This year is crucial in comparing the record of the last two governments. In April 2014, David Cameron launched his £50million Challenge Fund to pay for GPs to open out-ofhours. It guaranteed at least one GP surgery locally would be available in the evening and weekends. The Tories say it has led to improved access for 7.5million people at 1,100 surgeries. By March next year, a further £100million will have been spent on a further 1,417 practices across the country. Overall, there are now 1,600 more GPs than in 2010. It is not the first time Labour has used old figures in what is already a dishonest election campaign. The party's claim that families are £1,600 worse off under the Tories was also 12 months past its sell-by date. CLAIM: The Tories have made it harder to see a GP . REALITY: Anybody with memory of the Blair Years will know it is Labour - and the disastrous 2004 decision to renegotiate the existing GP contract - which lies at the root of the current problems. Not only did Labour abolish the requirement for every patient to have a named GP who was responsible for them, instead attaching them only to a surgery, but, most crucially, GPs were given more money despite no longer being required to work at weekends or at night. The inevitable result? Nine out often GPs stopped providing out-ofhours care - hugely increasing the pressure on hospital A&E departments. Former health Minister Mike O'Brien said the deal Labour gave to the GPs was 'the best they ever had... they probably all voted Labour in 2005'. Tory health secretary Jeremy Hunt has since made modest changes to the contract, such as giving four million over-75s a named GP, but there is still no requirement to work out- of-hours. CLAIM: The Tories have left the NHS weaker than at any stage in its history . REALITY: In the latest attempt by Labour and the Left to 'weaponise' the NHS, 100 doctors last night released a letter which claimed the NHS was 'withering away' under the Coalition and 'if things carry on as they are then in future people will be denied care they once had'. It went on: Privatisation not only threatens coordinated services but also jeopardises training of our future health care providers and medical research, particularly that of public health.' The problem is that much of the letter is at odds with the facts. Along with foreign aid, spending on the health service was ring-fenced from the cuts. Every year, it has received a real terms increase of at least 0.1 per cent. This equates to around £2.5billion extra a year. On privatisation, the NHS outsourced 4.4 per cent of its budget under the Labour party - but less than 2 per cent under the Coalition. It was Labour - not the Tories - which presided over the shameful scandals at Basildon and Mid Staffs hospitals which cost hundreds of lives.","GP circulated a letter claiming 'flat-line funding' had 'crippled' NHS .

"The issue of gender equality has been a hotly contested subject in the workplace for several years now, and recent statistics show that nothing much has changed. There are only three countries in the entire world where you are more likely to have a female boss than a male boss. A study by US research firm, Expert Market, looking at data from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) revealed that Jamaica is the country where you're most likely to have a female boss. Jamaica, Colombia and Saint Lucia, all relatively close to each other, have the highest percentage of female managers in the world . The world, organised and rated by the percentage of female bosses in the workforce . The Caribbean island had the world's highest percentage, at nearly 60 per cent. Out of the 108 world countries taken into consideration, Columbia was closely behind with 53.1 per cent of their managers being female, and in third place was another island, Saint Lucia, with 52.3 per cent. Closely following Jamaica at the top were the Phillipines at 47.6 per cent, as well as a series of other Latin America countries. Panama came in at fifth place and Guatemala was eighth while Eastern European countries were prevalent in the top ten, with Belarus sixth and Latvia coming in at seventh place. Britain (left) is a country where 34.2% of managers are women. Much of the Middle East (right), as well as Pakistan were flagged in red as accounting for the lowest percentage of women in managerial positions . Britain ranked relatively poorly and came in at 41st place out of 108 of the surveyed countries, as only 34.2 per cent of managers are women. Although the UK surpassed countries such as Germany (31.1 per cent), Spain (30 per cent) and China (16.8 per cent), it lagged behind major economies such as France (39.4 per cent), Russia (39.1 per cent) and Australia (36.2 per cent). More surprisingly was that Britain, as a first-world country, fell behind developing regions such as Kazakhstan (which had 37.2 per cent female bosses) and Moldova (ranking at 44.1 per cent of managers being women). The United States was ranked within the top 20 countries in the world, at 15th place, as 42.7 per cent of all managers are female. Pakistan was ranked as the worst country in the world for having female managers, at a meagre three per cent. The other poorly ranking countries included Algeria (at 4.9 per cent) and Jordan (at 5.1 per cent). The United States of America (pictured in light green) are among the top 20 countries in the world for having a female boss, as 42.7% of all managers are female . Michael Horrocks, brand manager at Expert Market, commented: 'It is promising to see that in a growing number of regions around the world, women are increasingly entering management positions and playing a more important role in business strategy.' Although the survey also revealed that nearly a third of all businesses around the world are now owned or managed by women, even more disheartening is the number of CEOs in large companies. There are currently only five female chief executives in the FTSE 100: Moya Greene at the Royal Mail, Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco, Carolyn McCall at easyJet, Liv Garfield at Severn Trent and Veronique Laury at Kingfisher.","108 countries were ranked according to percentage of female managers .

'At the beginning of January he went to Rome to study aboard and on the way home from a party he was brutally attacked and thrown off a 40ft bridge and hit the concrete below. 'He was in a coma and in critical condition for months.' Paula Barnett, who said she is a close family friend, told My Suburban Life, that Mogni had only been in the country for six hours when the incident happened. She said he was was alone at the time of the alleged assault and personal items were stolen. She added that he was in a non-medically induced coma, having suffered serious infection and internal bleeding. Mogni was a third-year finance major from Glen Ellyn, Ill., who was participating in a semester-long program at John Cabot University. Mogni belonged to the school's chapter of the Sigma Nu fraternity, reports the Chicago Tribune who posted a sign outside a building reading 'Pray for Mogni.' The fraternity's Iowa chapter announced Sunday afternoon via Twitter that a memorial service will be held on campus to remember Mogni.","Andrew Mogni, 20, from Glen Ellyn, Illinois, had only just arrived for a semester program when the incident happened in January .

"The Archbishop of Canterbury has hailed the victims of the massacre at a Kenyan university earlier this week as martyrs during his Easter Sunday sermon. Speaking at Canterbury Cathedral today, the Most Rev Justin Welby said the 148 mainly Christian victims of Thursday's brutal mass-murders were 'witnesses, unwilling, unjustly, wickedly, and they are martyrs in both senses of the word.' Pope Francis made similar statements during Easter Sunday Mass at St Peter's Square in the Vatican, where he also made a nod to the recent agreement between Iran and the international community over its nuclear power, calling it a 'step toward a more secure and fraternal world.' Religious holiday: The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby delivers his sermon during the Easter Day service at Canterbury Cathedral, Kent . 'Martyrs': The Most Rev Justin Welby said the nearly 150 victims of the university massacre in Kenya were 'witnesses, unwilling, unjustly, wickedly, and they are martyrs in both senses of the word' Religious leader: Pope Francis waves before delivering his 'Urbi et Orbi'(to the city and the world) message, where he prayed for an end to the persecution of Christians, from the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square after Easter Mass . Long wait: Thousands had gathered in St Peter's Square to hear the Pope, despite heavy rain and thunderstorms on Sunday morning . The Archbishop said Christians must resist without violence the persecution they suffer and support persecuted communities, with love and goodness and generosity. And he said: 'To witness is to be a martyr. I am told by the Coptic Bishop in England that the Coptic Christians murdered in Libya last month died proclaiming that Jesus Christ is Lord. They are martyrs, a word that means both one that dies for their faith and one that witnesses to faith. 'There have been so many martyrs in the last year. On Maundy Thursday, three days ago, around 150 Kenyans were killed because of being Christian. They are witnesses, unwilling, unjustly, wickedly, and they are martyrs in both senses of the word.' He added: 'These martyrs too are caught up in the resurrection: their cruel deaths, the brutality of their persecution, their persecution is overcome by Christ himself at their side because they share his suffering, at their side because he rose from the dead. 'Because of the resurrection of Jesus from the dead the cruel are overcome, evil is defeated, martyrs conquer.'

Waiting for the pope: Hundreds of worshipers wait in the rain for Pope Francis' arrival to the Easter Mass in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican . This is part of Pope Francis `Urbi et Orbi' Easter message, which he delivered Sunday: . 'We ask for peace, above all, for Syria and Iraq, that the roar of arms may cease and that peaceful relations may be restored among the various groups which make up those beloved countries. May the international community not stand by before the immense humanitarian tragedy unfolding in these countries and the drama of the numerous refugees. 'We pray for peace for all the peoples of the Holy Land. May the culture of encounter grow between Israelis and Palestinians and the peace process be resumed, in order to end years of suffering and division. 'We implore peace for Libya, that the present absurd bloodshed and all barbarous acts of violence may cease, and that all concerned for the future of the country may work to favor reconciliation and to build a fraternal society respectful of the dignity of the person. For Yemen too we express our hope for the growth of a common desire for peace, for the good of the entire people. 'At the same time, in hope we entrust to the merciful Lord the framework recently agreed to in Lausanne, that it may be a definitive step toward a more secure and fraternal world. We ask the risen Lord for the gift of peace for Nigeria, South Sudan and for the various areas of Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. May constant prayer rise up from all people of goodwill for those who lost their lives - I think in particular of the young people who were killed last Thursday at Garissa University College in Kenya -, for all who have been kidnapped, and for those forced to abandon their homes and their dear ones. Earlier today, thousands of worshippers braved thunder and rain to see Pope Francis lead Easter Sunday Mass in St. Peter's Square, the Vatican this morning. The iconic square had turned into a sea of umbrellas as a large crowd of Catholic faithful gathered to see the Pope lead the service in the enclave in Rome. The pontiff himself was shielded from the pelting rain by a canopy outside St. Peter's Basilica, while prelates carried umbrellas in the yellow and white colors of the Vatican. Following days of warm temperatures and sunshine, Rome  was lashed by thunderstorms early on Sunday, and the faithful wore rain slickers and held umbrellas during Mass. Afterwards, Pope Francis delivered a mostly sombre and grim 'Urbi et Orbi' (to the city and the world) message, where he prayed for an end to the persecution of Christians, commemorating the students massacred by Islamist militants at Garissa University in Kenya. 'We ask Jesus, the victor over death, to lighten the sufferings of our many brothers and sisters who are persecuted for his name, and of all those who suffer injustice as a result of ongoing conflicts and violence - and there are many,' he said. The pope spoke from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica as churches in Kenya, where al-Shabaab gunmen massacred nearly 150 people, singling out Christians for point-blank executions, turned to armed guards to protect their congregations on the most important day of the Christian liturgical year. Marking the third Easter since his election in 2013, the . pope maintained an Easter vigil tradition by baptising late . entries into the Church. 'May constant prayer rise up from all people of goodwill for those who lost their lives - I think in particular of the young people who were killed last Thursday at Garissa University College in Kenya - for all who have been kidnapped, and for those forced to abandon their homes and their dear ones.' Marking the third Easter since his election in 2013, the pontiff prayed for peace in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria, where Boko Haram Islamist militants have also targeted Christian churches. 'We ask for peace and freedom for the many men and women subject to old and new forms of enslavement on the part of criminal individuals and groups,' he said. 'Peace and liberty for the victims of drug dealers, who are often allied with the powers who ought to defend peace and harmony in the human family. 'And we ask peace for this world subjected to arms dealers, who make their money from the blood of men and women' he said. The pontiff also made a nod to the recent deal reached in Switzerland last week between Iran and the international community on a framework for a nuclear accord. 'In hope we entrust to the merciful Lord the framework recently agreed to in Lausanne, that it may be a definitive step toward a more secure and fraternal world.

"The principal of a school in Canberra has been suspended after it was revealed that an autistic boy was locked in a metal cage. It was announced yesterday an investigation was underway after it emerged a 10-year-old autistic bot was put in a 2m by 2m structure by his teachers at a Canberra school. The cage was specifically designed for him to as a 'withdrawal space' while in class. Scroll down for video . The cage was specifically designed as a 'withdrawal space' for the 10-year-old autistic boy. ACT Education MInister Joy Burch (pictured) said it is a horrifying situation . The Minister said an investigation into the incident is underway.'This structure could not be deemed acceptable in any way shape or form, in any of our public education schools, hence it was withdrawn,' she said . The principal has been removed from the school and two teachers with expertise in disability education have been assigned to the school. The structure was in place from March 10 to March 27, according to ACT Education Minister Joy Burch. Shadow Education Minister Kate Ellis said the mistreatment of students with a disability was 'shocking and deeply disturbing'. 'The abuse or neglect of students with disability is absolutely unacceptable,' Ms Ellis said. 'All students – including those with disability – deserve to be recognised as learners and supported to achieve their best,' she said. 'As a society, we have a responsibility to ensure our schools are safe and caring environments for all students, at all times.' It was also revealed that the school only removed the cage when they were ordered to do so by the ACT Education Department after they received a complaint from the boy's parents. Ms Burch said words could not describe her disappointment and horror at the situation. The Minister also said an investigation into the incident is underway. 'This structure could not be deemed acceptable in any way shape or form, in any of our public education schools, hence it was withdrawn,' she said. 'I have initiated an absolute thorough investigation as to the why this structure was allowed to be put in place. 'I have also made assurances through the school executive and through our support teams that the child and the family involved is given the utmost support over this time.' Ms Burch said she was 'very angry and very disappointed' with the incident and said the cage had no place in a classroom. ACT Education Directorate Director-General Diane Joseph (pictured) said the 'confronting' structure was 'entirely inappropriate and unacceptable' The issue came to light after a complaint was made to the Children and Young People's Commissioner about the cage and the name of the school cannot be revealed due to privacy reasons. ACT Education Directorate Director-General Diane Joseph said the 'confronting' structure was 'entirely inappropriate and unacceptable'. 'The space was basically a fenced-in structure inside a classroom,' Ms Joseph said. 'The structure was built for one particular student. 'The decision to erect such a structure raises so many questions. I have asked for the investigation to be treated with the upmost urgency.' The horrific news comes as organisations and people come together to recognise World Autism Awareness Day. The day is designed to raise awareness and much-needed funds through unique measures.","Principal  suspended after it emerged an autistic boy was locked in a cage .

"Benefits and welfare schemes are often blamed for making people less likely to want to work. But a study has found that the opposite may be true. A Europe-wide survey of 19,000 people revealed that the more a country paid to the unemployed or sick, and invested in employment schemes, the more likely its residents were to want a job. A Europe-wide survey of 19,000 people revealed the more a country paid to the unemployed or sick the more likely its residents were to want a job. In Norway, which pays the highest benefits in Europe, almost 80% of people wanted a job. In Estonia, one of least generous, only around 40% did . In Norway in particular, which pays the highest benefits in Europe, almost 80 per cent of people wanted a job, . By contrast in Estonia, one of the least generous countries, only around 40 per cent did. The survey was carried out by sociologists Dr Kjetil van der Wel and Dr Knut Halvorsen from Oslo and Akershus University College. They examined responses to the statement: 'I would enjoy having a paid job even if I did not need the money' put to the interviewees for the European Social Survey in 2010. People who are hungry are more inclined to support of the welfare state policies that help the poor. The extraordinary results of a recent study from Aarhus University found that the state of our bodies has a significant influence on our position on specific political issues. Researchers said people's support for apparently altruistic policies of wealth redistribution is not so much a reflection of concern for the poor but 'rather a strategy for securing further resources for themselves.' And they their findings could revolutionise perceptions of how people come to adopt a political stance, with our ideological views apparently swayed by basic biology. These responses were then compared with the amount the countries spent on welfare benefits and employment schemes, while taking into account the population differences between the member states. The UK was average for the generosity of benefits, which was reflected in the percentage of people agreeing with the statement at almost 60 per cent. The researchers also found that governments that intervene  to help the unemployed find work made people in general more likely to agree that they wanted work even if they didn't need the money. 'Many scholars and commentators fear that generous social benefits threaten the sustainability of the welfare state due to work norm erosion, disincentives to work and dependency cultures,' the researchers said in the paper, 'The bigger the worse? A comparative study of the welfare state and employment commitment'. 'A basic assumption is that if individuals can obtain sufficient levels of well-being - economic, social and psychological - from living off public benefits, compared to being employed, they would prefer the former. The UK was average for the generosity of benefits and this was reflected in the percentage of people wanting to work - at 60% (stock image pictured). The study also found that governments that intervene to help the unemployed find work made people more likely to say they wanted work even if they didn't need the money . 'When a 'critical mass' of individuals receive public benefits rather than engaging in paid work, the norms regulating work and benefit behaviour will weaken, setting off a self-reinforcing process towards the 'self-destruction' of the welfare state. They also said that this may be because people who receive generous benefits when out of work may feel more inclined to give something back to the state by striving hard to find work. 'The notion that big welfare states are associated with widespread cultures of dependency, or other adverse consequences of poor short term incentives to work, receives little support.' The paper was published in the journal Work, Employment and Society.","A Europe-wide survey of 19,000 people revealed that the more a country paid to the unemployed, the more likely its residents were to want a job .

"A married couple who thought they would never be able to have children are celebrating after welcoming triplets - born three years apart thanks to IVF. Denise and Glen Higgs, from Braunton, Devon, had all but lost hope that they would ever be able to conceive after Glen was made infertile due to cancer treatment. But using his frozen sperm, doctors successfully created eight embryos through IVF fertility treatment and the couple had a daughter Mazy, born three years ago. Louise and Glen Higgs with daughter Mazy, aged three and newborns Carson Alan (left) and Carter Joel (right) The couple tried again using the same batch and Denise gave birth to twins Carter and Carson last week. Former RAF fireman Glen said: 'Medical staff have told us our three children are triplets as they are all from the batch of embryos that were created at the same time. 'It is crazy really - seeing as there are three-and-half years between them in age.' Glen, 35, had always wanted to have children and decided to store sperm shortly before his testicular cancer treatment at the age of 20 made him infertile. He met Dee and, after living together for five years, tied the knot in 2011 before embarking on a course of IVF treatment. Carter Joel Higgs (white top) and Carson Alan Higgs (blue top) who were born on March 24 2015 weighing 5lb 12oz and 5lb 5oz, with IVF triplet sister Mazy Linda Higgs, aged three . Glen said: 'I had an unusual tumour growing within the testicle. After all my treatment, they tested my sperm and they were non-swimmers. 'I knew then that if I ever wanted to have children I would have to go through IVF. 'I had always wanted kids and first went through the process with Dee in 2010. We got funding for the first try and got lucky when Mazy was born.' Glen, now a manager at a filter-making factory, said: 'We then just had to wait and see if it attaches okay. We ended up having eight embryos. 'We put two in to attempt to have a child the first time and froze the other six. 'We were talking about getting rid of them - as we were paying a yearly storage fee - but decided to try again. We had to fund it ourselves this time and put two in again. 'Amazingly they both stuck and we have ended up with two more beautiful babies. 'I always wanted to have kids and am a big family man. The process we went through was hard but we could not have asked more from the final outcome. 'I am the happiest man ever. I have three healthy kids when I thought I would never have any. One we thought would be amazing - to have three is an unbelievable gift. 'What my wife and her body had to go through makes her the real hero to me.' Glen, 35, had always wanted to have children and decided to store sperm shortly before his testicular cancer treatment at the age of 20 made him infertile . He met Dee and, after living together for five years, tied the knot in 2011 before embarking on a course of IVF treatment: Carter Joel Higgs (white top) and Carson Alan Higgs (blue top) The IVF procedure involved doctors effectively 'hoovering' the eggs from of Dee's body and injecting them with the frozen sperm. Care assistant Denise, 27, said: 'When I heard I was having twins I cried and my husband just went white. To now have triplets is simply amazing. In the UK, one in every three thousand births is to triplets. Approximately 15 per cent of 'multiples' are born thanks to IVF. Source: TwinsUK . 'We were so happy though. It has been a huge change in our lives but we have just learnt to adapt. 'Going through IVF is one of the hardest things you ever have to go through as a woman. 'The whole process is horrendous, but as we have proved it does actually work. 'There are so many injections and medication and it can be very undignified at times. I did get very emotional at times but I have no regrets at all about doing it. 'I could not be happier with what we have been left with.' The couple have now disposed of the remaining embryos and have no plans to have any more children.","Denise and Glen Higgs thought they'd never have children .

"This is the shocking moment a single mother was caught on a hidden camera stealing money from the wallet of her boyfriend’s frail 89-year old grandfather. Hayley Adams, 29, of Barnstaple, Devon, was seen sneaking into William Tanner’s bedroom and taking cash from his coat, after a CCTV device was put in the room by his daughter Angela Wrenn. Ms Wrenn, 56, had earlier expressed concern that his money kept going missing, but was shocked to discover the culprit was a trusted relative - and the mother to Mr Tanner’s great-grandchildren. While Adams admitted to taking about £65, North Devon Magistrates' Court was told that the victim's relatives suspected the amount stolen in one year was closer to thousands of pounds. Caught: Hayley Adams (above), 29, of Barnstaple, Devon, was seen sneaking into William Tanner’s bedroom and taking cash from his coat, after a CCTV device was put in the room by his daughter Angela Wrenn . The videos were handed to police and have now led to Adams being convicted of three counts of theft - although she escaped with a community order, restraining order and a total fine of £175. Mr Tanner told the court he was left feeling violated and vulnerable after Adams stole money during several visits to his house in Barnstaple. Karen Ball, prosecuting, said the victim noticed money going missing from his wallet and thought at first he was being forgetful. She said he lived with his daughter Ms Wrenn who then became suspicious about Adams’s behaviour - so secretly installed the CCTV. Adams visited frequently and was overheard telling friends she had no money to go out with them, before she suddenly acquired some. The hidden camera instantly started picking up the offences. Mrs Ball said Adams had been in a relationship with Mr Tanner’s grandson - with whom she has two children - when the thefts took place. The couple have since separated. Seen on CCTV: The videos were handed to police and have now led to Adams being convicted of three counts of theft - although she escaped with a community order, restraining order and a total fine of £175 . In a victim impact statement, Mr Tanner said: ‘I have been violated. I am feeling very vulnerable and am constantly on my guard. I can’t trust anybody and it feels like I have had my personal space violated. ‘My room does not feel the same anymore. I have been feeling safer since she has not been allowed in the house. I think it is just knowing that she can’t get to me.’ Mrs Ball claimed the victim’s family suspected thousands of pounds were taken in 12 months, but the exact amount was unknown. Tony Dart, defending Adams, said the idea that thousands was stolen was ‘absurd’ and Adams admitted to taking around £65. Mr Dart said: ‘She is disappointed in herself. The offences took place when she was desperate for money. She is a single mother. She accepts her behaviour was reprehensible.’ Magistrates handed Adams a restraining order, banning her from attending the victim’s address or contacting him - and ordered her to pay him £65 compensation. She was also handed a six-month community order, with six months supervision, and told to attend an Engage Women programme. She was fined £50 and ordered to pay a £60 victim surcharge.","Hayley Adams, 29, admitted stealing £65 from William Tanner's bedroom .

"Hillary Clinton lost the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination because Barack Obama was the picture of cool. This time she's not taking any chances. The former secretary of state's campaign-in-waiting has reportedly signed a lease for two floors of office space in Brooklyn, New York – the epicenter of hipster culture . Brooklyn has transformed itself in recent years from Manhattan's ugly little brother into the Big Apple borough where everyone wants to live. And the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood is among the most hipster-friendly of them all. Scroll down for video . VERY HIP: Hillary's HQ will be in the cooler-than-thou enclave of Brooklyn, New York . COOL: Open floor plans and hardwood floors are part of the hipster appeal of the Clinton campaign's new digs . It's not clear whether the campaign itself or some other legal entity signed on the dotted line, but putting ink to paper at the aristocratic-sounding 1 Pierrepont Plaza has started a countdown clock. The Federal Election Commission's rules require candidates to declare themselves publicly within 15 days of doing anything that's considered campaign activity. So far among serious contenders, only Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz has officially entered the 2016 presidential race. Politico reported on the lease-signing, saying that Clinton chief of staff Huma Abedin has been spotted walking around the neighborhood and touring the building. Abedin might have dropped in on the neighbors who will share the 19-story mini-skyscraper, including the mega investtment bank Morgan Stanley and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. That's the office currently occupied by Loretta Lynch, who's awaiting Senate confirmation for the job of U.S. Attorney General. 1 Pierrepont Plaza will feature Hillary staffers rubbing elbows with a federal prosecutor and Morgan STanley 1-percenters – when they're not browsing Urban Outfitters or eating at Shake Shack . Scoping the neighborhood: Clinton and New York City first lady Chirlane McCray (right) checked out a Brooklyn preschool on Wednesday . But the vibe is decidedly bourgeoisie, with 1 Pierrepont's building management showing off the ambiance with a map showing potential renters where to find the nearest Chipotle, Starbucks, Shake Shack and Urban Outfitters. There are also a Banana Republic, a private squash club, and at least three art galleries nearby . A Republican Party official in Iowa who asked Daily Mail Online to withhold his identity said on Friday that Clinton's choice of digs 'won't matter much in flyover country where most of the votes are.' 'We're more likely to be impressed if you're close to a Wal-Mart,' he joked. 'The tallest building in [my town] is three stories.' A GOP Senate staffer laughed out loud at what he said would be 'Hillary's hipster hell.' 'I guess we can expect all the Clinton campaign t-shirts to have ironic slogans, right?' he said. 'I can't wait to drink Pabst Blue Ribbon at the launch party.'","1 Pierrepont Plaza also houses Morgan Stanley and the federal prosecutor's office .

"It sat on a stark white block in a vast room that resembled a laboratory. I was at the SculptureCenter in the New York borough of Queens, a spot dedicated to all things modern and avant garde. Taking pride of place was a cluster of bottles, each of which contained dog fluff and a photo of the mutt it came from. ‘We’re running a competition to find new talent,’ explained the black-clad curator, brightly. ‘Maybe I’ll shave the cat next time I visit my parents,’ I thought to myself. ‘If I stick the fluff in a bottle, it might just win.’ Cultural revolution: New York is in the throes of a cultural revolution - but MOMA is still brilliant . Welcome, then, to Nu York, a city that bears no resemblance to the version depicted in Friends and Gossip Girl and instead centres around a throbbing contemporary arts scene largely based in Brooklyn and Queens - the latter the beneficiary of a recent gentrification programme. Gone (mostly) are the rough tenements and in their place, a bustling network of shop-lined streets and some seriously classy bars and hotels. Among the latter was the Z Hotel, a stark block of a building decked out in the industrial-chic style so beloved of London hipsters. Stateside Shoreditch, as it were. It was all a far cry from Iceland where I had begun my trip, courtesy of an Icelandair wheeze that gives you the option of stopping off to see the sights of Reykjavik and the spectacular Golden Circle for up to seven days en route to Boston, Anchorage, Washington or, in my case, New York. Although still on the global naughty step thanks to a calamitous economic meltdown in 2009, the Icelandic capital shows signs of recovery – not least in the form of the revellers that lined the street outside the Apotek Hotel, a gloriously Scandinavian-looking place to stay, as I arrived at midnight following an evening flight from London. The next morning, I dragged myself out of bed for a Viking-style cooking class at Salt Eldhus where I learned to cook barley risotto and salt and pepper salmon – the perfect way, as it turned out, to fortify me for the dramatic scenery that came next. Stunning: The Gullfoss Waterfall in Pingvellir National Park is a short hop from Reykjavik . Awe-inspiring: Geysir is home to a row of geysers that fire boiling water and a sulphurous stench into the air . Covered with a thick layer of snow, Pingvellir National Park sits atop the fault line that separates the American continent from the European one and provides Iceland with its volcanoes, geysers and geothermal springs. The site of Iceland’s first parliament, it’s a short hop from Geysir, where a series of geysers explode in a shower of boiling water and revolting sulphurous stench every five minutes or so. Slipping and sliding on the ice, the first explosion caught me unawares and forced me to jump back. At the next one, I held my nerve, looking smugly round at the tourists who had been caught on the hop like I had been. Then came a trip to Friðheimar, a series of greenhouses filled with tomato plants and set next to a stable crammed with hairy Icelandic ponies. The glowing buildings were an odd sight, although the produce was second to none, but even that paled in comparison to the Secret Spring – a bubbling pool flanked by a geyser and lit, on clear nights, by the shimmering green and purple glow of the Northern Lights. Sitting there, watching them ripple, was truly magical. The next morning, it was off to New York which, with its claustrophobic cluster of skyscrapers and determinedly chic inhabitants, was a very different prospect indeed. While Iceland, like the rest of Scandinavia, boasts an effortless flair for design and a natural cool, the Big Apple has clearly worked on it. Beneath the too-cool-for-school surface, however, lies some old-fashioned Americana – not least in the all-American charm of the cheerful locals. Looking cool: Williamsburg, home to Jake Gyllenhaal among others, is awash with artisan bars . New look: Queens has had a makeover, with tough neighbourhoods replaced with cool shops and chic bars . Among them are the staff at the Roger Smith Hotel in Manhattan, who took a break from watching the Super Bowl to ply me with burgers and fries as I arrived, dishevelled, following a five-hour flight from Reykjavik. The next morning, after an all-American breakfast of bacon and waffles, I left the chintzy charms of the Roger Smith behind for a visit to MOMA, the epicentre of New York’s cultural cool. A fabulous place set in a glass and steel building over several floors, it is crammed with modern art dating from the mid-18th century onwards. Matisse, Monet and Picasso are there in numbers, as are Frieda Kahlo and Andy Warhol. Rothko, Malevich and Seurat dot its walls, as does some appalling stuff by the likes of Jean-Pierre Basquiat – avoid that and stick to the good bits on the third floor is my advice. Carrying bags of Warhol prints and a Sunday morning sized MOMA mug, we hopped into one of New York’s iconic yellow taxis for a short ride to low-rise Williamsburg, where another hipster favourite – craft beer – is taking hold. Beneath the pub where we ate lunch was a small collection of stills, where a variety of types, including one containing raw oysters, was being brewed. It was all delicious and a pleasant change from the Budweiser usually found in American bars. Artisan beer, artisan food and artisan art are all staples of New York’s burgeoning hipster culture, although to a cynical Brit like me, some of it felt a little try-hard. Brilliant: The Museum of Moving Image is set to become a New York must-visit - well worth going to . A case in point is the play Sleep No More, which made its début in London to critical rumblings and indifferent audiences but has become a real favourite in New York. Set in a warehouse over several floors, the idea is that you walk in at an unspecified point in the play (I managed to work out that it was a version of Macbeth but not everyone does) and follow the actors around attempting to get a handle on the action. Beginning in a wonderfully old-fashioned red-velvet lined bar, the action was compered by a chap with a British accent taken from the Dick van Dyke school of acting, who showed us into a lift and provided us with Scream-style masks before throwing us into the thick of things. Moving around the huge set, I walked into scene after scene and never really got much sense of the plot, although I did find myself becoming increasingly irritated with the hammy miming. Indeed, so disjointed was Sleep No More,   $20 booklets explaining the plot were being flogged to theatregoers, who had already paid $80 to get in, on their way out. Being unable to work out what it was all about is clearly a recurrent problem. Luckily for those whose tastes don’t stretch to baffling plays and bottles of dog fluff, New York still has much to love. Along with MOMA, there’s the brilliant Museum of Moving Image in Queens which takes you on a whistlestop tour through the US’ lengthy cinematic history with the help of a cleverly curated selection of pieces, among them the creepy doll which found fame in the Exorcist. Then there’s the bewildering selection of places to eat. In Queens alone, there’s everything from Brazilian to British and everything in between - and nearly all of it is delicious. And of course, there are all those iconic sights: the slow-moving Hudson River, the Rockerfeller Center, the Statue of Liberty and more. Nu York might not be to everyone’s taste but there’s no shortage of reasons to love the Big Apple – pulsating art scene and a quirky taste in plays included.

"A student expelled from George Mason University for violating its sexual misconduct policy is suing in federal court to clear his name, arguing that an encounter with a girlfriend was sadomasochistic role playing, not sexual assault. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday in Alexandria. The ex-student has sued under a pseudonym to protect his privacy. The university is demanding he identify himself publicly, despite arguments that doing so would expose not only him but the woman who says she was assaulted. The student says he had been in a longstanding relationship with the woman, and that they frequently engaged in sadomasochistic role playing that involved using a safe word if one or the other wanted to stop. Lawsuit: A student expelled from GMU for violating its sexual misconduct policy is suing in federal court to clear his name, arguing that an encounter with a girlfriend was sadomasochistic role playing, not sexual assault (file) The lawsuit comes as colleges across the country, and particularly in Virginia, are under increased scrutiny for how they respond to allegations of sexual assault. The University of Virginia implemented changes in its sexual misconduct policy in the aftermath of a now-discredited Rolling Stone article alleging that school officials were indifferent to allegations that a student had been raped at a fraternity party. The sexual misconduct allegations at George Mason stem from an October 2013 encounter with the couple in the male student's dorm room on the Fairfax campus. At one point, according to the lawsuit, she pushed him away but didn't invoke her safe word. Later that night, the two engaged in a second sex act, in which the male student asked her if she was interested, and she replied, 'I don't know.' According to the lawsuit, the couple remained romantically involved for several months, but they broke up after she found that he had been cheating on her. It was only then that she filed a complaint against him, according to the suit. In September, a university panel conducted a 10-hour hearing to determine whether the student had violated the university's code of conduct. A three-person panel cleared him of any wrongdoing, according to the suit. But the woman appealed, and a university administrator, Assistant Dean of Students Brent Ericson, overruled the panel and expelled the student. Process: The lawsuit claims the woman only filed a complaint after the couple broke up and she had found out the man was cheating on her (file) The lawsuit says that the appeal was handled improperly. It seeks an order that would strike the violation from his student record, and $3 million in damages. The lawsuit claims that the expulsion was a result of gender bias, and also claims that it violated his right to engage in constitutionally protected sexual activity. 'The only explanation for such a rash, unreasoned, and unsupported decision is Mr. Ericson's desire to help a complaining female when the system had found a respondent male not responsible. If Jane Roe (the pseudonym for the unidentified female student) were not a female complaining of sexual assault, her testimony would not have been credited over John Doe's given the evidence corroborating John Doe's explanation of their BDSM relationship and the material concessions Jane Roe made at the hearing,' the student's lawyers wrote in their complaint. A GMU spokeswoman declined comment on the lawsuit. The university, in court papers, wants to overturn a judge's decision allowing the student to sue anonymously. The university's lawyer writes that the male student should have no fear of embarrassment if the allegations are true, because the public is increasingly accepting of unusual sexual relationships. And he argues the risk of the woman's identity being exposed is minimal compared to the public's right to an open judicial proceeding. 'Even if Ms. Roe is identified simply by the fact that Mr. Doe is identified, there is nothing in the record to suggest Ms. Roe will be subjected to retaliatory harm,' Assistant Attorney General David Drummey wrote on behalf of the university.","A student expelled from George Mason University for violating its sexual misconduct policy is suing in federal court to clear his name .

"Hundreds of relatives, friends and strangers have gathered to bid an emotional farewell to the 23-year-old man who perished in the gas explosion and building collapse in New York City last month. Nicholas Figueroa's mother, Ana, was among more than 200 mourners to attend the funeral for her son, who was on a second date at a sushi restaurant in the city's East Village when he was killed. Carrying a red rose and wearing a button featuring her son's image, she wept as she watched his casket being loaded into a hearse outside the Church of the Holy Name of Jesus in Manhattan. Mr Figueroa's father, Nixon, who supported his wife throughout the funeral, told mourners: 'I'm here but I'm broken. My son is broken. My wife is broken. It hurts... It's heartbreaking for everybody.' Scroll down for video .

I appreciate everybody coming. I'm going to put my son to rest now.' Mr Figueroa, a former model and bowling lane employee, was settling the check for himself and his Bowlmor Lanes colleague at the Sushi Park restaurant in Second Ave. when the building exploded. He was declared missing following the terrifying incident, which gutted three buildings. But last week, his body was pulled from the building's rubble alongside that of 26-year-old busboy, Moises Locon. During Tuesday's service, mourners - including City Council Speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito - clung to each other and wept as heartfelt speeches were made and 'Ave Maria' rung through the church. Mr Figueroa's brother, Neal, paid tribute to his 'best friend', who had worked as a camp counselor at Manhattan's Asphalt Green sports facility. 'I want to be just like him,' he said, according to NBC. He added: 'I can't wait to have my own little boy, he's going to have the same name: Nicholas.'

'I want to be just like him,' Neal told mourners . The emotionla funeral was held at the Church of the Holy Name of Jesus (pictured) in the Upper West Side . The Reverend Lawrence Ford praised Mr Figueroa for his selfless work as an Eagle Scout with the Boy Scouts, saying that his life had been 'cut too short,' according to the New York Daily News. One Boy Scout at the funeral told CBS the victim had shown 'devotion and leadership'. Meanwhile, Paul Culff of Asphalt Green, said Mr Figueroa had 'left an impression' with the facility's youngsters. Mr Figueroa's parents placed a white cloth over his brown casket as a symbol of his innocence. Inside the casket, their son was reportedly dressed in a blue shirt, a checkered tie and a navy vest. Following the service, a number of pallbearers - including Mr Figueroa's father and his brother Neal - were pictured carrying his casket to a hearse in front of  loved ones, who were holding red roses. It was then placed in a hearse and driven away. In addition to Mr Figueroa and Mr Locon's fatal injuries, 22 more people were wounded in the five-story building explosion at 121 Second Avenue. Probe: Mr Figueroa's parents placed a white cloth over his brown casket as a symbol of his innocence. Above, investigators work on the site on April 2 to determine whether charges should be brought over the explosion . Blaze: Firefighters battle the flames following the explosion at the East Village apartment block last month . Former model: Mr Figueroa (pictured left and right) was declared missing following the terrifying incident . Mr Figueroa's date, Teresa Galarce, 22, suffered a broken nose, a broken rib and a punctured lung. She is now recovering from her injuries. It is unknown whether she attended Tuesday's funeral. The explosion also caused fires at 119, 123 and 125 Second Avenue. All buildings apart from 125 ultimately crumbled to the ground, prompting an enormous response from emergency crews. Following the recovery of his body, Mr Figueroa's family had started raising money to help cover his funeral costs and other expenses via a GoFundMe page, which amassed more than $27,000. On Monday, it was reported that a plumber who worked on the building has accused the building's landlord's son of making him illegally tap a gas line ahead of the deadly blast on March 26. The unidentified plumber admitted that he illegally tapped a gas line before the explosion but said he only did so on the orders of the landlord's son, Michael Hrynenko Jr., the New York Post reported. Another victim: Last week, Mr Figueroa's body was tragically pulled from the building's rubble alongside that of 26-year-old busboy, Moises Locon (pictured), who had worked at the sushi restaurant six days a week . Aftermath: Firefighters continue to hose down the site of the fire that gutted three buildings on March 27 . The gas was apparently being siphoned from the restaurant to tenants in the building. Investigators suspect the illegal hookup was switched before Con Ed inspectors visited the building on March 26, and after they left, it was put back, the Post reported. It added that authorities have not yet decided whether to use the plumber's statement against him or if they will get him to testify in exchange for a deal. Neither the landlord, Maria Hrynenko, nor her 29-year-old son Michael, who also goes by the name 'Mischou', responded to the paper's requests for comment. On Monday, it was claimed that a plumber who worked on the building has accused the landlord's son, Michael Hrynenko Jr (pictured), of making him illegally tap a gas line ahead of the deadly blast . Property records show he lives in Sparkhill in Rockland County, New York after moving from 7th Street in the East Village last year, where he lived in an apartment owned by his family. The investigation continues as authorities continue to pick through the rubble at the site. But charges including second-degree manslaughter and reckless endangerment could be brought against anyone believed to have been behind the blast, the Post reported. In August, utility workers found that the gas line had been illegally tapped, Con Ed said. The discovery led the company to shut down gas service to the building for about 10 days while the building owner made repairs. Gas service was restored after the utility deemed it safe. Inspectors from Con Ed visited that building about an hour before the explosion and determined work to upgrade gas service didn't pass inspection, locking the line to ensure it wouldn't be used. The work underway was to put in a bigger line to serve the entire building, according to Con Ed. But 15 minutes after the workers left, the smell of gas was reported. No one called 911 or Con Ed. Instead, Michael Hrynenko and a contractor, Dilber Kukic, opened the basement door to check on where the smell was coming from. When they did so, a massive explosion shot through the building, forcing rubble onto the street and sparking a fire that spread to neighboring buildings. Both Michael Hrynenko and the contractor escaped the scene, but officials later pulled the bodies of Mr Figueroa and Mr Locon, who worked at the restaurant six days a week, from the rubble. The contractor, Dilber Kukic - who is facing unrelated charges of bribing an undercover investigator posing as a housing inspector - declined through his lawyer to comment on the explosion.","Nicholas Figueroa, 23, killed in gas explosion in the East Village last month .

"The BBC has axed Richard Hammond and James May from the Top Gear website after co-presenter Jeremy Clarkson was sacked from the show. The motoring programme's website previously featured the broadcasting trio alongside The Stig at the top of the page but now the racing driver appears solo in his white helmet. It comes just over a week after the 54-year-old host was sacked from the BBC for an 'unprovoked' attack on a Top Gear producer. Scroll down for video . Change: The Top Gear website now features an image of The Stig on his own at the top of the page . Before: The website used to feature an image of all three presenters - Richard Hammond (left), Jeremy Clarkson (centre) and James May (right) as well as racing driver The Stig (far right) The BBC say the masthead change is to 'simply reflect the fact that all three presenters are currently out of contract on the show'. However the Corporation is yet to confirm whether Hammond, known as 'The Hamster', and May, who is dubbed 'Captain Slow', will return to the popular show. Both have recently changed their Twitter bios too, with Hammond saying: 'Can't explain it really ... er, I do this car show and stuff.' While May's profile reads: 'Former TV presenter only remembered for saying ""Oh c***"". Or was that the other bloke?' The pair also revealed today that they are selling off a dozen bikes from the classic motor cycle collections - raising more questions about the future of their employment. May is putting eight of his two-wheeled treasures under the hammer, while Hammond, is doing the same with four of his. The BBC say the website change is to reflect the fact that none of the presenters are currently in contract . Together the 12 bikes are estimated to be worth a guide price of £66,000 and are being sold off by auctioneers Bonhams later this month. The Top Gear duo’s bikes are being sold off by auctioneers Bonhams at their Spring Stafford Sale later this month. May insisted the decision to sell the bikes came before the latest BBC Top Gear turmoil, saying: ’Just because I’m unemployed now doesn’t mean I have to get rid of everything. ‘I was going to sell these bikes anyway. And those paintings, and my collection of Scalextric cars. Honest’. Hammond added: ‘As a serious collector of motorcycles, it’s important to review one’s stable regularly, and the Bonhams Stafford sale is the ideal opportunity to move bikes on and possibly acquire new ones. Hammond and May also revealed they are selling off a dozen bikes from the classic motor cycle collections . The BBC confirmed they will fulfil the Top  Gear live gigs, but they will be stripped of the Corporation's branding . 'I also have a canoe, and some Wharfedale hi-fi speakers, if anyone’s interested’. However the BBC has confirmed that Top Gear's live world tour will go ahead next month, with the three original presenters at the helm. They will do a series of gigs, which have already sold 200,000 tickets worldwide and made £10million, but the show will be stripped entirely of all BBC branding. Clarkson was sacked from Top Gear on March 25 after it was found that he had punched producer Oisin Tymon in a 30-second assault, leaving him with a split lip and needing hospital treatment. The BBC announced 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another' following the suspension.

"A zoo is facing criticism from animal rights activists after an Asian elephant died - 25 years after he sustained a leg injury while in captivity there. Rama the elephant, who completed paintings with his trunk, died Monday, Oregon Zoo officials announced on Facebook. He was 31. 'Rama had experienced a sharp decline in mobility in recent weeks, an issue stemming from a 25-year-old injury to his left front leg,' the zoo said in the post. Scroll down for videos . Missed: Rama the elephant was euthanized this week at the age of 31 by Oregon Zoo officials. His leg was injured after female elephants shoved him into a moat in 1990 . Skill: Rama used his trunk to create paintings, which reportedly earned over $100,000 in sales . It continued 'The treatments that had been successful for many years were no longer easing his discomfort, and so — with sadness and compassion — our animal-care staff decided the most humane course of action was to euthanize him.' The elephant's 32nd birthday would have taken place on Wednesday. Studies vary on how long Asian elephants live in captivity. A 2008 study which looked at Asian elephants in European zoos says they have a median life expectancy of 19 years. A 2004 study indicated a 36-year median for Asian elephants in North America. Zoo veterinarian Jim Storms said in a release on the Oregon Zoo's website that Rama's 2013 tuberculosis diagnosis did not play a role. Deputy Director Chris Pfefferkorn said in the release the leg injury took place in 1990 as Rama was sexually maturing. He said in what is considered normal activity for the animals, older female elephants shoved Rama out of the herd and into a moat. Courtney Scott, a leader of the protest group Free the Oregon Zoo Elephant, told KOIN 'He shouldn't have been put in a herd with adult females when he was young. I think that is a grave error on the part of the zoo and just shows what happens when elephants live in zoos.' Artwork: One of Rama's paintings - made by using his trunk - is seen here . Friendship: Rama (left) is seen with female elephant Chendra . Memories: Rama is seen in this 1991 photograph, one year after his leg was injured . 'Well, Rama sustained the injury before any of the folks that work here were here,' the zoo's elephant curator Bob Lee countered in an interview with KOIN. He went on 'They made the best decision they could at the time. They were trying to give Rama the opportunity to stay in that herd situation.' Scott also told the television station that Oregon Zoo doesn't have enough room to hold the elephants. Zoo staff, however, told KOIN construction on a larger elephant enclosure is underway. Lee told the television station 'Rama was a really special elephant. He had strong bonds with the folks that worked with him, to the community. 'We had a lot of people that would come out every Sunday and watch him paint. We had a lot of people that grew up with him.' Zoo officials said Rama's paintings have been showcased by the Mark Woolley Gallery. One woman, Calley O'Neill, painted with the elephant for five summers, KPTV reported. According to the television station, Rama's solo paintings have made over $100,000. Rama's work with O'Neill can be seen at the website forThe Rama Exhibition. O'Neill told KPTV 'There's no elephant on Earth that has ever done or ever will do such magnificent abstracts.'
