"A simple breath test that could help detect the early stages of stomach cancer has been developed by scientists. The screening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development. By looking for distinctive ‘breath prints’, researchers were also able to distinguish between patients at high and low risk of developing the disease. Scroll down for video . In and out: Thanks to a breath test, researchers claim there were able to detect the early stages of stomach cancer and also to distinguish between patients at high and low risk of developing the disease (stock image) Israeli researchers say the system is accurate, cheap – and allows patients to be monitored without using invasive procedures. The discovery comes as scientists in the US made a breakthrough that could lead a test to flag up the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer. A protein has been identified which seems to play a crucial role in the rapid growth of tumours. The breath test discovery is hoped to save thousands of lives. About 7,000 people develop stomach cancer in the UK each year and most of these cases are in the advanced stages when they are diagnosed. Research leader Professor Hossam Haick of the Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute in Haifa, said: ‘The attraction of this test lies in its non-invasiveness, ease of use, rapid predictiveness, insensitivity to confounding factors, and potentially low cost.’ Breathe: The tscreening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development (stock image) Previous research has found that other methods could be used to identify stomach cancer, but none looked at detecting pre-cancerous changes. In the study published online in the journal Gut, breath samples were taken from 484 people, including 99 already diagnosed with stomach cancer. They were analysed by so-called nanomaterial sensors, which are able to read a chemical signal or pattern linked with stomach cancer based on very small particles in a patient’s breath. The test is so accurate it could detect the difference between early and late stage gastric cancers. The researchers hope the breath test could be used as an alternative to endoscopies, an invasive and expensive procedure to diagnose gastric cancers using a long flexible tube. A large trial involving thousands of patients, including those with stomach cancer or pre-cancerous changes, is currently under way in Europe to test the technology’s suitability as a screening method, they add. Meanwhile, US experts say the discovery of a new biomarker protein may one day lead to a test which differentiates men with aggressive prostate cancer from those with a less threatening form of the disease. The findings, published in the scientific journal Oncogene, raises hope of tests that deliver an accurate diagnosis from the outset. The results could lead to more targeted treatment for those with the worst cancers – and less treatment for men whose tumours are not dangerous. Professor Renny Franceschi, of the University of Michigan, said it paves the way for a ‘warning light’ that signals how dangerous the cancer is. It might also one day lead to a treatment which stops tumours growing. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men, with 40,000 diagnosed in Britain every year. Current tests only identify whether a tumour is likely to be present. But they are unreliable, holding a high risk of ‘false positives’ that wrongly identify healthy men as having cancer. Professor Franceschi said that if further research proves positive, eventually it might lead to a test involving a simple biopsy when the patient first complains of symptoms.","Tests spot chemical signals in exhaled air linked to tumour development .

"The father of a 10-year-old Minnesota boy whose body was found in the Mississippi River over the weekend was arrested Monday, less than a month after he appeared at a vigil tearfully pleading for his safe return. Pierre Collins was taken into custody on suspicion of second-degree murder in the death of Barway Collins, Crystal Police Chief Stephanie Revering said in a news release. Pierre Collins was phootgraphed Monday being placed in the back of a squad car in handcuffs and taken away from his apartment complex in Crystal. He will be processed and taken to the Hennepin County Jail. Pierre Collins, the father of a 10-year-old boy whose body was found in the Mississippi River over the weekend, sits in the back of a police vehicle after he was arrested Monday on suspicion of second-degree murder . A body pulled from the Mississippi River on Saturday has been identified as Barway Edward Collins (above), 10, who has been missing for nearly a month . Collins' wife, Yamah Collins, was later escorted to an unmarked police vehicle and also driven away. She was not cuffed. A timeline for charging will be determined by the Hennepin County Attorney's office, Revering said. Revering said authorities have electronic evidence that shows Mr Collins, 33, was in that area of the river at the time the fourth-grader disappeared. Authorities said the body of the ten-year-old was found on Saturday around 1pm by searchers from a Boy Scout troop - about ten feet from the river's edge in Brooklyn Center. The police chief said Sunday the boy's father was a primary suspect in the case. Collins has said he is innocent. Crystal Police Chief Stephanie Revering said authorities have electronic evidence that reveals that the boy's father, Pierre Collins, was in that area at the time he disappeared (above Revering during a news conference on April 12, 2015 in Crystal, Minnesota) Barway's father, 33-year-old Pierre Collins (pictured left as he stands with his wife, Yamah, during a vigil held for his son last month) is a primary suspect in the homicide investigation involving his son . 'This location is consistent with our knowledge of Pierre Collin's activities on March 18 and he remains a primary suspect,' said Revering. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner said the cause and manner of Barway's death are still being investigated. The case is being considered a homicide based on the autopsy and information from the medical examiner, said Revering. A report last month by Fox 9 said that according to sources, Pierre Collins, took out a life insurance policy in Barway's name totaling $30,000 not long before the child went missing. Authorities have seized Pierre Collins' passport to ensure the Liberain national stays in the US. Police were stationed at his apartment complex for his own protection after reports of death threats. On Sunday, Pastor Harding Smith, of the Spiritual Church of God who has been acting as the family's spokesman said when the family received the news, there were a lot of tears, according to Twin Cities. 'There were lots of tears and lots of screams,' he said. 'There was disbelief, hurt, sadness. There is a deep sense of loss when you enter that home.' Alexander Collins, executive director of the Liberian Ministry Association, said: 'We also want to make clear to the perpetrator of this tragedy, that wherever you are, you will be found. This evil will be found. 'Wherever you are hiding, under a car, underground, make no mistake our community does not abide this evil.' The Hennepin County Medical Examiner said the cause and manner of Barway's death are still being investigated . Barway, who was a student at Evergreen Park World Cultures Community School, was last seen after school last month. In video released by police (scenes from footage above), Barway says 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle' In a March 25 interview with the Star Tribune, Pierre Collins said he was not home when his son disappeared and he was upset to be considered a suspect. 'I've been working with the police just to bring my son home,' he told the newspaper. 'I will do whatever they want just so Barway can come home. I have nothing to do with Barway's missing.' His wife and Barway's stepmother, Yamah Collins, also said she and her husband did not know who took the boy, and they pleaded for his safe return. Pierre Collins (right), accompanied by Pastor Harding Smith (center), the family's spokesman, was interviewed by Nancy Grace last month, saying that he failed the polygraph test because he was very emotional . Police said on Sunday that the boy's father (above) is a 'primary suspect' as the case becomes a homicide investigation . Police released a video of Barway riding a bus after school. In the video, the boy said 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle.' 'The father and the party described as an 'uncle' are likely the last known people to have seen Barway,' Revering said, as reported by the Star-Tribune. 'Unfortunately, we have reason to believe that Barway's father has not been completely truthful with us.' Addressing the footage on the bus, Pierre Collins explained to Nancy Grace that in the Liberian community, children commonly refer to adults as 'uncle' or 'auntie.' When pressed by Grace about the failed polygraph test, Collins explained that he was 'very emotional' during the test. 'I wasn't...myself when I took the polygraph,' he said. The boy was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm on March 18 after the child failed to come home from school (above a massive billboard featuring a missing ad for Barway) Barway, who was a student at Evergreen Park World Cultures Community School, was last seen after school last month. The boy was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm on March 18 after the child failed to come home from school. A call to the school bus company revealed that the 10-year-old was dropped off outside his building at around 4.15pm. Video surveillance from his apartment complex shows he was about to go inside, but then turned around as if he was called over to the parking lot by someone he knew, and he walked away, police said last month. Rosario Ramirez left and her children Daniela, five, Isaac, nine, and Juan, 11, pay their respects to Barway Collins during a vigil at Cedarwood apartments in Crystal, Minnesota held last month . A young boy adds a donation for Barway Collins' family to the pile during the vigil last month . The family told the Star Tribune that Barway emigrated from his home country of Liberia, where his mother lives, to stay with his father in 2011. The father said he wanted 'to make him better' and for Barway to eventually go to college. While looking for Barway, local police, federal agents and Hennepin County's sheriff's deputies searched the area with K-9 dogs, reviewing footage from surveillance cameras and interviewing family members and witnesses.","Barway Edwin Collins, 10, went missing from his Crystal, Minnesota apartment complex March 18 after school .

"It's hard to imagine exactly what is going on in the heads of parents who would give their daughter a name like 'Airwrecker' - an alternative spelling to 'Erica' - but apparently, such a thing exists. A new Reddit thread asking users to submit the most horrendous baby names they have ever come across has attracted more than 18,000 comments in just 24 hours, and turned up a treasure trove of bad parental judgement calls. FEMAIL has compiled the worst examples, including the names 'Orgasm', submitted by the daughter of a midwife who has heard her fair share of horror stories, and 'Mazen', because 'it was 'mazen' (amazing) when the child was born. Unlucky: A new Reddit thread asking users to submit the most horrendous baby names they have ever come across has attracted more than 18,000 comments in just 24 hours, and FEMAIL has compiled the top 12 . 'There is a girl in my school named Gennah Tyles. With a G,' wrote one submitter. 'It’s like her parents wanted to name her genitals.' 'I work at a bank in North Florida and have been keeping a list of names I come across,' wrote another. 'My favourite so far is definitely I’munique. It was on her ID and everything.' Sadly for the owner of this moniker, as another user pointed out, her every introduction would have to be: 'Hello, I'm I'munique.' One submitter reported a friend having named her child 'Britney Shakira Beyonce', claiming: 'They would call her by the full name every time.' The user who submitted the name Orgasm wrote: 'As the daughter of a labor and delivery nurse, I've heard an abundance of terrible baby names, but I'd have to say this is by far the worst! Sadly, I'm not kidding.' A handful of people warned against the pitfalls involved with combining two names into one. 'A friend of my sister-in-law worked in a maternity ward and saw a kid named after her grandparents, John and Veronica. Her name was Vejonica,' one wrote. Three-in-one! One submission was the name 'Britney Shakira Beyonce', which the mother would say in-full every time she addressed her baby . A user known as RhymesW added a contribution: 'Orgasm. As the daughter of a Labor and Delivery nurse, I've heard an abundance of terrible baby names, but I'd have to say this is by far the worst! Sadly, I'm not kidding.' 'According to my friend Hellzel, her mother liked the name Hazel but her dad was a biker and loved Hells Angels, so they came up with this mess,' another remarked. 'Boy Boy' was also submitted, by a user who insisted this was not a first and middle name, just the first name of a child he knows. 1. Obamaniqua . 2. I'munique . 3. Boy Boy . 4. Hellzel . 5. Abstinence . 6. Britney Shakira Beyonce . 7. Vejonica . 8. Gennah Tyles . 9. Mazen . 10. Like . 'Abstinence' was another shocker. 'I predict she will be pregnant by 16,' mused the submitter. 'This very young couple, who had just had a baby, were so obsessed with Facebook they decided to name their child Like, I kid you not,' wrote another. More than a few users mentioned the name Obamaniqua as being the real name of children they had come across, which is defined by Urban Dictionary as: 'A ghetto-fabulous African-American that loves president Barrack Obama.' Several users trudged up celebrities as being good examples of bad name-givers, specifically Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin for naming their daughter Apple, Kim Kardashian and Kayne West for their tot North West, and Lil' Kim, for naming her daughter Royal Reign. Perhaps none were quite so morbid as the name 'Lucifer', which belonged to a 'little blonde boy with bright blue eyes' at the school of one submitter, and who was apparently 'a very creepy kid.'

Sophia, Emily and Lily for a girl, according to BabyCentre's annual survey, and Muhammad, Oliver and Jack for a boy.","A new Reddit thread has garnered 18,000 submissions of terrible names .

"Fresh fears were raised last night that Greece could exit the eurozone after it was claimed negotiations with its European creditors were ‘not working’. An official at the International Monetary Fund reportedly admitted that he cannot envisage a successful conclusion to the country’s bailout. Greece this week repeated threats to stop paying off its loan and default on its debt if Europe refuses to release more funds. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors . This would make it harder for the country to remain in the eurozone, although no state has ever left and there is no official exit process. Poul Thomsen, the IMF's Europe Director has been quoted by the Greek media as saying he could not see a successful conclusion to the country's current bail out. The fund's Europe chief reportedly told his executive board that negotiations were not going as hoped, the Daily Telegraph reported. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors. One Greek official has been quoted by the Financial Times as saying that if the European Central Bank did not play ball with the Mediterranean Eurozone member there could be no alternative to a default. Mr. Thomsen also issued a warning over Greece's recent, weak economic performance. He met with Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis earlier this month. Greece repaid a roughly €450 million loan instalment to the International Monetary last week but Athens' financial problems, as outlined by Mr. Thomsen, have renewed fears the country might miss the IMF payment of €200m payment on the 1st May and another for €745m 11 days later. This could lead to he EU member being forced, eventually, to leave the eurozone. The IMF debt stems from Greece's international bailout, under which the country was extended €240 billion in rescue loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF to prevent bankruptcy. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (left) met with Mr. Thomsen who expressed worry over the Greek economy. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' (right) government has been talking with creditors since January . Varoufakis has said that Greece is committed to making its repayments and accepts the fiscal restrictions imposed on the country but within reason. He said at a conference last week that Greece was 'not going to sign on the dotted line of anything you give us just to get the next loan tranche', 'At the very same time,' he added, 'we need to have a fiscal plan that makes sense. At the moment Greece is committed.' However,Greece's new left wing-led government which has been locked in strained negotiations with creditors since winning elections in January continues to hold its recent election victory over the international community. Varoufakis has said that Greece is committed to making its repayments and accepts the fiscal restrictions imposed on the country but within reason . Greece's defence minister Panos Kammenos, whose right-wing Independent Greeks party props up the country's socialist government, said they had a mandate to rule. 'Even if elections take place, we will double our share of the vote,' he told Greek TV. Greece has been given until 20 April to clean up its finances and set in place a number of economic reforms, necessary if it is to receive further rescue money. There is seemingly a great deal to be done if the country is to meet creditors' expectations. The IMF will meet in Washington this week and Yanis Varoufakis is due to meet President Obama on Thursday. Greece has been given until 20 April to clean up its finances and set in place a number of economic reforms, necessary if it is to receive further rescue money .","IMF Europe head says bail-out negotiations with Athens are 'not working'

He had been spotted partying up a storm at a number of musical events including a Foo Fighters concert in between his filming schedule. He also showed up for a Marilyn Manson show in Brisbane, even appearing on stage with the famous rock star. The actor flew back to LA after injuring his right wrist on March 10 and it had been thought he would only be gone for a couple of weeks, prompting more speculation about what was keeping him from the set of the Disney film. He returned Down Under Tuesday with his right hand still bandaged with a red bandana. Holding on tight: Johnny has to go back to work filming the fifth Pirates Of The Caribbean movie for Disney.

It was entirely dependent on that,' said Michael Singer, a publicist for Jerry Bruckheimer Films as he announced the actor's arrival back in Australia . Rumors about the state of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's marriage ratcheted up a notch on Monday in the U.S, with fresh claims in the media that the couple spend more time apart than together. But it's clear the celebrity couple are anxious to put the rumors to rest. Amber, who turns  29 on Wednesday, is obviously planning to celebrate with her husband. Her appearance by his side as he returns to work is surely designed to dampen speculation that all is not well between them and to quash fears, reported by People.com on Monday, that Johnny had been struggling to control his partying during filming.

It came after Amber turned up solo at the Tribeca Film Festival for the premiere of her movie When I Live My Life Over Again on Saturday and as Johnny failed to show up for work on schedule at the Australian set of the fifth Pirates Of The Caribbean. At the weekend, a report in Australia claimed that the star of the Disney franchise was a week overdue for his return Down Under. Sydney Confidential said Johnny failed to board his scheduled private charter flight from Los Angeles and 'has now been missing for a week'. Principal photography on the $250 million production had been scheduled to start again on April 20 but the fact the star hadn't shown up by then only added to the rumor mill. Scroll down for video .

Johnny, seen boarding a plane in Brisbane bound for LA back in March after injuring his wrist while filming the new Pirates Of The Caribbean film . People.com poured more fuel on the fire Monday when the magazine quoted an unnamed insider who confirmed the actor was still in LA. 'There are rumors on the set that he was in rehab,' the insider told the publication. 'As soon as Johnny arrived in Australia, he was partying hard,' the insider said. 'After he got injured, no one was surprised. He didn't seem to care at all about filming and was all about partying.' Rocking and rolling: The Pirates Of The Caribbean star joined Marilyn Manson on  stage at his Brisbane concert last month . Having a good time: Johnny also attended a Foo Fighters concert in the Queensland capital in between his filming schedule . Amber and Johnny legally married at the 21 Jump Street star's LA home on February 3 and then jetted off to his private island in The Bahamas for a more traditional celebration a few days after. But according to the People. com story, their busy schedules cut the honeymoon period short with Amber heading to London  to shoot The Danish Girl and Johnny going back to LA. An unnamed source told the magazine that 'it's not surprising' the two aren't spending much time together. 'They seemed to have a lot of relationship problems in the months leading up to the wedding,' the source says. 'When the wedding finally happened in February, it had been postponed several times. ...

But a few days later, they went their separate ways due to career commitments . The New York Post's Page Six alleged that Amber's close friendship with photographer Io Tillett Wright is another reason there is tension between the two stars. It reported that the openly bisexual actress became friends with Wright in 2012, the same year she started dating Johnny, and that the actor and activist  once stayed in the actor's guest house. A source told Page Six that Johnny  'doesn’t like Io' and believed Amber and he 'were spending too much time together for it to be comfortable.' Wright eventually moved out of Depp’s guest house. Close friends: The Rum Diary actress and actor, photographer and LGBT activist Io Tillett Wright have been spending time together in New York.

"A Hillary Clinton campaign official explained on Monday why her presidential advisers have brought pre-screened partisans to some events promoted as an opportunity for the former secretary of state to meet with 'everyday Americans.' Just steps away in a Keene, New Hampshire bakery, a few run-of-the-mill people decided they didn't want to be seen with her. 'There was a bit of a thing back here when she came in,' explained Marcia DuBois, a cashier at Kristin's Bistro & Bakery on Washington Street, where Clinton spent a half-hour talking with customers and shaking hands. 'A few of the staff didn't want to come out to meet Hillary,' DuBois said. 'They just don't like her.' 'Which is too bad,' a co-worker offered while looking furtively to see who was listening. 'You may not agree with her. Okay. But you should respect the office she's shooting for.' Scroll down for videos . Hillary Clinton met a few employees at Kristin's Bakery in Keene, New Hampshire on Monday as her presidential campaign in the Granite State got underway, but some in the kitchen refused to be seen with her . The former first lady, senator and secretary of state posed with locals before a small-business roundtable event, but her communications director wouldn't rule out the possibility that some of them were brought in for the occasion . CHAT:  On her way to a discussion at a local company Hillary Clinton stopped at Kristin's bakery and met some customers. MEETING: Hillary was welcomed by people in the coffee shop - although not universally . The dissenting kitchen staffers declined to be identified or speak on the record. Others at Kristin's were more congenial, including an infant girl named Molly who cooed while Clinton held her. 'I'm going to take her home,' the Democratic White House hopeful joked. While Clinton held court with three Granite Staters and their pastries, her communications director Jennifer Palmieri explained the unfolding scene. Asked whether the campaign had brought any of the customers with them, Palmieri said, 'I think maybe some of them, but I don't know.' New Hampshire's WMUR-TV later reported that two of the people Clinton spoke with had been asked to come. Clinton's team took flak last week in Iowa after a Democratic Party operative conceded that Clinton's state political director Troy Price pre-vetted and drove a trio of activists to a coffee shop, where they played the part of everyday Americans while shutters snapped. The man, Austin Bird, had been an Obama intern in 2012 and was Vice President Joe Biden's chauffeur when he came to Davenport Iowa last year. As senior campaign aide Huma Abedin made tea, Palmieri defended the practice of recruiting participants to attend those small meetings. It's a necessary evil in early primary and caucus states, Palmieri said, and part of recruiting future Clinton evangelists from among the Democratic base. 'We have to go after Democrats before we do anything else,' she insisted. 'And in Iowa? Especially in Iowa, and New Hampshire.' 'But sure. People are asked –' MEET MOLLY: Clinton enjoyed the oldest campaign tactic in the book – posing with a baby – on Monday, and gushing that she wanted to bring the infant home with her . SIT-DOWN: Hillary Clinton at the campaign stop at Kirsten's bakery and coffee shop in Keene, New Hampshire . AIDE: Huma Abedin, Hillary's right-hand woman was present for the stop today. She was by her side as they stopped in Chipotle in Ohio, where they left without leaving a tip . In LeClaire, Iowa six days ago, Clinton's campaign took flack for bringing three Iowa Democratic partisans to a cafe where they appeared to be 'everyday Americans' meeting over coffee . Jennifer Palmieri (file photo) Palmieri thought briefly and reframed her comments in the past tense. 'People were asked to come to a meeting at a coffee house,'  she said, referring to a stop in in LeClaire, Iowa. Price, the Iowa political strategist, brought Bird to the Iowa coffee house along with two young women – one a Planned Parenthood employee, the other a College Democrats chapter head. 'If someone like that loves her, then they'll talk to other people, and so on, and that's going to help,' Palmieri said. 'We wanted to go after those specific people. I mean, they could go for O'Malley. They could do a lot of things.' Former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley has been sending signals that he's ready to mount a challenge to Clinton. Clinton was in Keene on Monday for a roundtable discussion with small business employees. She will lead a similarly intimate event on Tuesday in Concord.

TUNE-UP: One of the Scooby vans gets a tune-up before beginning the new road trip from Chappaqua to New Hampshire this weekend . As the Democratic front-runner made her way to the back to shake hands with some of the bakery employees, she ignored questions and kept her comments superficial. One man addressed her as 'Secretary Clinton,' while a woman settled on 'Mrs. Clinton.' Palmieri said her boss has become accustomed to answering to a variety of titles and honorifics.

"Two Florida women who are in a relationship and worked at the same daycare center are fighting to get their jobs back after they were fired for being gay. Jaclyn Pfeiffer, 29, worked at the Aloma Methodist Early Childhood Learning Center in Orange County full-time for the last 18 months, while her partner, Kelly Bardier, 33, was recently employed as a part-time teacher. The two have been together since October. However they were both terminated after the director, Barbara Twachtman, heard rumors about the two and asked Pfeiffer whether she was seeing Bardier . 'I feel like if a person can do their job, gay, straight or whatever, they should be able to work and do their job that they love to do,' Pfieffer told Click Orlando. Fired for being gay: According to Jaclyn Pfeiffer, 29 (left), rumors of her sexual orientation began to circulate after her girlfriend, Kelly Bardier, 33 (right), took a job in another part of the school as a substitute teacher . Termination: Even though the couple insisted they had tried to keep their relationship private, the director of Aloma Methodist Early Childhood Learning Center fired both of them because of their sexuality . School: Aloma Methodist Early Childhood Learning Center receives $2,442 in taxpayer funding per child from the state of Florida for providing voluntary prekindergarten (VPK) during the school year . 'I never thought they would actually fire me for being gay.' Bardier added that she was given the option to 'change her lifestyle' to keep her position. The daycare is run by Aloma United Methodist Church. In a statement, the church said they 'felt the need' to let both women go. 'We can say decisions regarding their employment involve long-standing local church policies intended to reflect the beliefs and values of this congregation,' Gretchen Hastings, director of communications for the Florida Conference UMC, said in a statement to Click Orlando. 'These are policies applicable to all employees. Our church continues to be in prayer for all of those affected.' Together: Jaclyn Pfeiffer, 29, and Kelly Bardier, 33, seen here at Disney World, have been together since October last year . However Pfieffer and Bardier are hitting back. They content they were unaware of the church's stance against gays when they accepted their jobs. They have now hired a lawyer, Mary Meeks, who maintains that religious freedom does not mean workers can be fired because of their sexual orientation. They have threatened to sue Aloma United Methodist Church if they do not reinstate Pfieffer and Barider and offer an apology by  April 15. According to The Orlando Sentinel, a resolution passed in 2008 states that the church opposes 'all forms of violence or discrimination based on gender, gender identity, sexual practice or sexual orientation'. Strict: Despite the state funding, Aloma Methodist broke no state or federal laws when the couple's employment was terminated, they maintain . After the two were fired, Twatchman emailed parents saying Pfeiffer, who is well-like by the two-year-olds she cares for, had decided to leave for 'personal reasons'. Twatchman added she had been a 'wonderful teacher' who was 'gifted with children'. 'I am very sad that she is leaving,' the email said, according to The Sentinel. Unemployed: Jaclyn Pfeiffer and Kelly Bardier say they were terminated from their jobs at Aloma Methodist Early Childhood Learning Center after the school discovered they were in a relationship .","Jaclyn Pfeiffer, 29, worked at the Aloma Methodist Early Childhood Learning Center in Orange County, Florida, full-time for about 18 months .

"A teenager who fell ill with flu four months ago is unable to move her arms and legs and can barely eat or talk. Doctors are still trying to find out what the future holds for 17-year-old Natasha Willard after she was diagnosed with inflammation of the brain when she fell ill while studying for her A-levels in Cwmbran in Wales. Miss Willard's family are unsure how the teenager became ill so suddenly, just four days after she returned her feeling unwell. They are now trying to teach her to walk and talk again. Natasha Willard was studying for her A levels at college when she appeared to get the flu just before Christmas and her condition has worsened, leaving her unable to move her limbs and barely able to speak . Her stepmother Kirsty Willard said: 'The doctors are baffled, they do not know what happened. 'They have given her antibiotics and she is on steroids too. 'We are just left in limbo. The doctors have not said what the future holds; they cannot give us that information.' Natasha has been diagnosed with encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. Natasha appeared fit and well days before she came home ill, and appeared to quickly go down hill . Mrs Willard said doctors have told them they are unsure whether she will make progress, but have warned the family she is unlikely to fully return to herself. Natasha, from Cwmbran, was studying art and Welsh in the sixth form at Torfaen's Llantarnam School when she fell ill. Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. Symptoms include seizures, convulsions, tremors, hallucinations, stroke, haemorrhaging, and memory loss. Encephalitis develops in reaction to a viral infection or when the body's own immune system attacks brain tissue. The condition can also be caused by the immune system reacting to a tumour. Around 4,000 people are diagnosed with encephalitis every year. Some people make a full recovery from the condition but others can be left with permanent damage to the brain and complications including memory loss and epilepsy. She came home on December 5 after a night out with friends and went straight to bed. Over the next few days Miss Willard started vomiting and had aches and pains, and her family presumed she had the flu. But on December 9 she collapsed and was mumbling and had to be taken to hospital. The teenager cannot remember the first four weeks of her illness and  was unresponsive for the first three. She was then transferred from University of Wales Hospital, Cardiff, to Rookwood Hospital, also in Cardiff, for intensive physiotherapy and speech therapy. 'She can say a few words,' said Mrs Willard. 'She can say ""Hi dad"" and ""Hi Kirsty."" She can say her own name, and her brothers' names, her sister's name and she can say ""yeah.""' Mrs Willard said they are having to teach the 17-year-old everything from scratch, as if she is a child again. But, she adds that she has not complained about her condition. Mrs Willard, who works in a bar, said they are worried about the reaction of people when the teenager is discharged from hospital. 'I would hate to think her friends would see her in a wheelchair and abandon her,' she said . Miss Willard (left) is pictured before her prom in 2014 and with her father Robert (right) before she became ill . Miss Willard's family have been told by doctors that they do not know if she will make a full recovery . November will be the teenager's 18th birthday and her family are hoping she will be able to come home. The family have been raising funds to pay for their hospital visits and have collected £700 packing bags in Cwmbran's Asda. 'We rely on lifts and buses,' Kirsty said. 'We don't want to put too much on our families. When we take the kids it costs £17.10. 'Without the kids it is still £8 each.'","Natasha Willard appeared to be suffering from flu just before Christmas .

"SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today hit back at claims from Tory former Prime Minister Sir John Major that she poses a 'real and present danger' to the UK. In a speech today, Sir John claimed the SNP would use any power they wield in Westminster after the election to foster division and further their dream of the break up of the 300-year-old Union. And he mocked Ms Sturgeon over her demand to play a role in propping up a Labour government, when she is 'not even bothering' to stand as an MP herself. Scroll down for video . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was mocked by ex-PM Sir John Major over her demand to play a role in proper up a Labour government, when she is 'not even bothering' to stand as an MP herself . Sir John said that he had repeatedly warned in the 1990s that devolution to Scotland would make independence more, not less, likely. Labour had argued it would 'kill independence stone dead' but instead it 'fanned the flame' which lead to the referendum which left the Union 'battered' but intact. 'Now, it is at risk again,' he said. Labour's only route back to power is in hock to smaller, left wing parties, he said, leading to 'more borrowing, more spending, an end to welfare reform, and far more people dragged into higher tax brackets'. Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru would demand more money for Wales while the 'worthy' Green party's economic plan is 'a recipe for economic self-harm'. He warned of 'mayhem' if the SNP holds the balance of power, with a weak Labour government open to a 'daily dose of blackmail' to secure the support of the nationalists in Commons votes. The SNP would use its role in Westminster to bolster support ahead of next year's Scottish Parliament elections, when it will put independence back on the agenda, Sir John said. The Tories hope to capitalise on a damning poll which shows more than half of British voters want Ms Sturgeon and her party to play no part in the next government. 'The SNP is a real and present danger to our future,' Sir John said. 'They will pit Scotland against England. That could be disastrous to the people of Scotland – and fatal to the UK as a whole.' But Ms Sturgeon branded his comments 'an affront to democracy'. Addressing the Scottish Trades Union Congress in Ayr, she said that SNP MPs at Westminster could 'vigorously and loudly' support a future Labour government in some areas. The SNP leader added: 'John Major's comments are silly, over the top and frankly they don't show him in a particularly good light. 'I want the SNP to go to Westminster to make Scotland's voice heard and also to be a voice for better politics, for the kind of politics that stands in opposition to Tory policies of austerity and undermining public services and pushing more people into poverty. 'I can understand why that message of standing up for ordinary people not just in Scotland but across the UK might offend John Major as an ex-Tory prime minister, but I think it's a message that will continue to win support right across Scotland.' The former Prime Minister sought to contrast the 'social division' he said was sown up Labour's politics with the economic competence and 'strongly beating heart' he said typifies the Tories . Nicola Sturgeon is threatening to break up the UK without even 'bothering' to stand for election to Westminster, Sir John Major said today. In a personal attack on the SNP leader, Sir John cast doubt on the legitimacy of a party which only stands in one part of the country setting the direction of the national government. 'They are part of the United Kingdom and so of course they have got the right to have a degree of legitimacy,' he said. But he accused Ms Sturgeon of plotting the break-up of the Union from Edinburgh. 'What I'm saying is I don't think the SNP party, whose leader is not even bothering to run for the Westminster election, are behaving in a way that is in the interest of the United Kingdom, by seeking policies that will break Scotland away from the United Kingdom. 'And they emphatically will not deny that separatism is their aim.' After last year's vote saw 55 per cent of Scots reject the idea of separation, nationalists insisted the issue was settled for a generation. But Ms Sturgeon has since left the door open to a second referendum before 2020. Sir John said the SNP would 'manufacture grievance' to make a Yes vote more likely any future referendum. 'They will ask for the impossible and create merry hell if it is denied. The nightmare of a broken United Kingdom has not gone away. 'The separation debate is not over. The SNP is determined to prise apart the United Kingdom.' Ms Sturgeon yesterday unveiled an anti-austerity manifesto setting out her price for propping up a weak Labour government, including higher spending fuelled by more borrowing. Polls continue to show up to half of Scots are planning to back the SNP, robbing Labour of dozens of seats and depriving Mr Miliband of hopes of a majority. Mr Miliband and Ms Sturgeon have ruled out a formal coalition with SNP MPs sitting in Cabinet. But they have left open the possibility of the SNP supporting a Labour government on a vote-by-vote basis, raising the prospect of Mr Miliband being forced to bow to their demands to get any legislation through. Sir John warned that this will leave the country open to a 'daily dose of blackmail' as the SNP makes fresh demands in return for supporting Labour in Commons votes. 'If Labour were to accept an offer of support from the SNP, it could put the country on course to a government held to ransom on a vote-by-vote basis,' Sir John said. 'Labour would be in hock to a party that - slowly but surely - will push them ever further to the left. And who would pay the price for this? We all would. We would all pay for the SNP's ransom in our daily lives - through higher taxes, fewer jobs, and more and more debt. 'This is a recipe for mayhem. At the very moment our country needs a strong and stable government, we risk a weak and unstable one - pushed to the left by its allies, and open to a daily dose of political blackmail.' And Labour's Alistair Darling, who led the No campaign against Scottish independence, said the Tories were 'flirting with English nationalism' in a 'desperate' way which could lead to another period of divisive wrangling over Scotland's position. Labour leader Ed Miliband accused the Conservatives and David Cameron of 'talking up' the SNP in the hope that the nationalists will win seats from Labour north of the border and allow him to 'crawl back' into 10 Downing Street. A poll showed just 22 per cent of voters across the UK back the idea of Ms Sturgeon playing a role in the UK government, with 54 per cent opposed . The SNP has already suggested that it will be 'entitled to vote against any bit of legislation' and 'any bit of spending' it does not agree with. It means that for Labour to pass new laws or agree to spending in England, Wales or Northern Ireland they would have to strike a deal with the SNP. Much of the SNP manifesto appeared designed to demonstrate common ground with Labour, promising to scrap the bedroom tax, reverse NHS reforms, increase the minimum wage and tackle energy bills. But in key areas it went much further, threatening to drag Labour further to the left to make the party 'bolder and better'. It included scrapping the Trident nuclear deterrent, ending austerity and embarking on a £140billion spending spree. In a series of co-ordinated Conservative attacks, David Cameron warned a Labour-SNP deal would be a 'match made in hell' for the British economy. London Mayor Boris Johnson said allowing Scottish nationalists to preside of the UK government would be like getting 'Herod to run a baby farm'. But some Tories fear the attacks could backfire. Lord Forsyth - who served as Scottish secretary in Sir John's government - warned that building up the SNP to undermine support for Labour in England could ultimately damage the Union. 'We've had the dilemma for Conservatives, which is they want to be the largest party at Westminster and therefore some see the fact that the nationalists are going to take seats in Scotland will be helpful,' he told the Guardian. 'But that is a short-term and dangerous view which threatens the integrity of our country.' Ms Sturgeon has made clear that in the event of a hung parliament she will be in London on May 8 to take charge of talks with Labour. 'I am the leader of the party, I would lead those discussions if we're in that scenario.' she said yesterday. However, just 22 per cent of voters across the UK back the idea of Ms Sturgeon playing a role in the UK government, with 54 per cent opposed. It makes the SNP by far the least popular potential coalition partner. Pollsters ComRes said older British adults were the most likely to be opposed to SNP influence. A survey for ITV News found an astonishing 71 per cent of those aged 65 and over want to lock Ms Sturgeon out of power, compared to 44 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds. Amid fears of a backlash south of the border, Ms Sturgeon claimed she was offering the 'genuine hand of friendship' to the rest of the UK. She said: 'The SNP isn't going to Westminster to seek to bring down governments or block budgets. We're going to Westminster to build an alliance for good, positive, progressive, sensible change.'","Former Tory PM warns SNP would use role in government to breakup UK .

"It's the must-have wedding snap for newlyweds – the happy couple celebrating with their closest family and friends after they tie the knot. But not everyone was smiling after Sir Paul McCartney married Heather Mills. Take a closer look at Macca's wedding party picture and you'll spot his daughters Stella and Mary looking decidedly glum. Scroll down for video . The pair – daughters of Sir Paul's first wife Linda, who died of cancer four years previously – were said to have been less than overjoyed by their father's choice of partner. The remarkable picture is a portent of the bitterness that would follow the wedding in 2002 – as Sir Paul and Ms Mills separated in 2006 and went through a bitter and messy divorce in 2008. Astonishingly, the image is the first to emerge of the former Beatle and Ms Mills from their wedding reception. In another never-before-seen picture, Sir Paul acts out a mock striptease in front of his delighted bride during the reception, which was attended by 300 guests. Sir Paul, then 59, and Ms Mills had ordered a media blackout of the event in Ireland. These pictures belong to the family of Sir Paul's late housekeeper Rose Martin, who was among those invited to the event at the 17th Century Castle Leslie in County Monaghan. The ceremony was shrouded in such secrecy that on the invitations guests were told only to arrive at a hotel at Heathrow Airport at an appointed time from where they would be flown to an unnamed destination. Other guests included the only other surviving Beatle, Ringo Starr, the band's legendary producer Sir George Martin, Pretenders singer Chrissy Hynde, and model Twiggy. Sir Paul and Ms Mills are pictured (left) in 2003 at a screening for the film 'Concert For George' and (right) in Hollywood in 2007 .

The couple turned down a £1.5 million offer from Hello! magazine for exclusive photos of the event. One official portrait – of the couple outside the church – was published, for charity. These photos and other memorabilia, including the invitation – featuring Sir Paul giving Ms Mills a piggy-back – are being sold at Omega Auctions in Stockport, Cheshire, next month. Mrs Martin's family decided to sell them after her death aged 92 in 2013.

"The heartbroken grandmother of a toddler who died of massive head injuries after her drug-addicted mother and violent partner forced her to ride a motorbike that repeatedly crashed has wept with relief at a coroner's findings. Little Chloe Valentine, 4, died of massive head injuries after being forced to ride a motorbike that repeatedly crashed over a three-day period in the backyard of her Adelaide home in January 2012. Her mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne, and her then partner are in jail after pleading guilty to Chloe's manslaughter through criminal neglect. In an emotional statement outside the Adelaide inquest on Thursday, Chloe's grandmother Belinda Valentine welcomed Coroner Mark Johns' ruling that Families SA was broken and fundamentally flawed and that the agency's lack of action over Chloe's mother's drug use was a complete failure. 'The sun comes up tomorrow even though you don't want it to,' Mrs Valentine said. At an inquest into her death on Tuesday authorities said social workers missed the chance to save Chloe Valentine, 4, who died of massive head injuries in 2012 . In an emotional statement outside the Adelaide inquest on Thursday, Chloe's grandmother Belinda Valentine welcomed Coroner Mark Johns' ruling that Families SA was broken and fundamentally flawed . The inquest has heard Chloe was forced to endure chronic neglect at the hands of her drug-using teenage mother Ashlee Polkinghorne (left) and her partner Benjamin Robert McPartland (right) 'We are actually the lucky ones, because we had Chloe in our life', her grandmother said . 'We are actually the lucky ones, because we had Chloe in our life. 'She loved us, and we loved her very much. 'She will always be our four-year-old, but as we move forward she will always come with us. In a scathing verdict, the coroner found social workers 'flagrantly disregarded' their legal responsibilities to seize children from neglectful parents. Mr Johns said nothing short of a 'massive overhaul' was required by the agency. '(Families SA) took the path of least resistance, and the whole history of its dealing with Ashlee is a history of drift, irresolution and aimlessness,' he said. Mr Johns described Polkinghorne as an 'accomplished and manipulative liar' who easily fooled her case workers. 'Ashlee was given virtually limitless opportunities to address her problems,' he said. She was often given the benefit of the doubt by social workers, who helped clean her house and avoided confronting her about her drug use. Polkinghorne was also provided with three supported accommodation sites and government-subsidised childcare. The young girl was forced to ride a motorbike for days on end by her drug addicted mother and her partner . Chloe died in 2012 from head injuries sustained after being forced to ride a motorbike three times her weight for days on end by her drug addicted mother Ashley Polkinghorne and her partner at the time . Belinda Valentine said she repeatedly begged authorities to take Chloe off her parents and into her care . He said the agency made a 'mistake' when they declared it was unnecessary to drug test Polkinghorne, a known amphetamine user, and condemned the 'rigid' agency's failure to consider Chloe's grandmother as a potential guardian. Before Chloe died, Families SA received 20 abuse notifications from friends and family concerned about the girl's filthy, transient and unsafe living conditions. Handing down 22 recommendations to improve the system, Mr Johns said there had been a lack of analysis, lack of clinical supervision and a lack of leadership. During the inquest, counsel for Families SA, Michael Grant, said it wasn't clear whether Chloe would have been saved if the agency had intervened more forcefully. 'Families SA does operate in a hideous and imperfect world,' he said. 'It's not certain, in my submission, what would have happened if that circuit breaker had been applied.' The South Australian government is expected to respond to the coroner's finding later on Thursday. Mrs Valentine said the coroner's recommendations 'can be taken now'. Belinda Valentine (left) has slammed Families SA  saying they could have saved her granddaughter Chloe Valentine's (right) life . Ms Valentine said she called social worker Leanne Stewart from the scene of a domestic dispute pleading to take Chloe away from Ashley . However Ms Stewart (pictured) denied in court that such a phone call ever took place . A comprehensive review of Chloe's case had made clear that a 'circuit-breaker' was needed to save the girl from the chaos in her life . The coroner has asked why Chloe's mother Ashley was repeatedly given the benefit of the doubt .

"The widow of a cyclist killed after hitting a pothole during a charity ride from Land's End to John O'Groats has won a six-figure payout from the council who failed to mend the road. Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was ‘no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident’. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had ‘existed for some time prior to the accident’. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell’s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.’","Martyn Uzzell died instantly when a 4in pothole threw him into path of a car .

"A yob who stole a mobile phone from a man who lay dying in the street shouted and swore outside a court appearance. Scott Stephenson is due to be jailed for stealing a phone from a man he found collapsed in the street in South Shields, Tyne and Wear. He unleashed an extraordinary expletive-filled rant outside court this week after he was re-bailed for sentence following his failure to turn up to a previous hearing. Scott Stephenson shouted and swore outside court after he was bailed ahead of his sentencing for a theft in which he stole a phone from a man dying of hypothermia . Stephenson was due to be sentenced for the offence, but failed to turn up to a previous court hearing . Scott Stephenson had been due to be jailed for the incident after admitting theft, but he skipped bail until he was arrested and sent back to court. The 19-year-old, from South Shields,  rifled through his 22-year-old unnamed victim's pockets and made off with the iPhone 4. His victim had tripped and fallen unconscious on the cold December day. Stephenson and friend Dale Walker, 25, found him but - instead of calling for help - took his phone and abandoned the man. The next morning the victim's body was discovered close to a playground, and a post mortem examination revealed he had died from hypothermia during the cold December night. Stephenson found the man lying on the floor on a cold December evening but instead of calling for help he and friend stole the man's iPhone . Members of the public looked on in horror during the extraordinary outburst near Newcastle Crown Court . Stephenson made rude gestures outside South Tyneside Magistrates when he appeared last month to plead guilty to theft and Walker admitted handling stolen goods. Appearing before Newcastle Crown Court on Tuesday, Stephenson made similar gestures as he stood on the street where members of the public were eating lunch. He was seized on Monday after a warrant was issued for his arrest when his failure to appear left his co-defendant sitting in the dock alone and his victim's family in anguish. He was re-bailed for the sentence - which will be arranged for a later date after a pre-sentence report has been prepared.","Scott Stephenson went through the pockets of man dying from the cold .

"With its carefully controlled, stage managed events and blandly repetitive slogans, the election campaign so far has been just a little bit boring. But not if you are on Nick Clegg's tour, where the Lib Dem leader has boarded his bright yellow 'fun bus' for a series of bizarre and unlikely photo opportunities which today saw him try his hand at ten-pin bowling. Aides say it is part of a deliberate strategy to get the Deputy Prime Minister out of London to meet normal people as they go about their daily lives. And if that means pulling pints, sipping cocktails, hurtling down a zipwire or chatting to Joey Essex or a hedgehog with a brain injury, Mr Clegg seems only to happy to oblige. Scroll down for video . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg appears determined to enjoy the election campaign, spending his Sunday afternoon ten-pin bowling . The visit to the bowling alley in Colchester, Essex delighted local people, and the press pack who have complained that the campaign so far has been boring . Aides say it is part of a deliberate strategy to get the Deputy Prime Minister out of London to meet normal people as they go about their daily lives . The Lib Dem leader is touring the country in a bright yellow election battlebus fitted out with a radio studio to allow him to continue his regular broadcasts designed to drum up support before May 7. While strategists admit they struggle to compete in the 'air war' as Labour and the Tories dominate the TV and radio bulletins, they believe Mr Clegg's enthusiasm for getting out and meeting people is paying off. On the first day of the election campaign, he rushed from a meeting with the Queen at Buckingham Palace to a wildlife sanctuary in Solihull. There he was introduced to Humpty, a hedgehog with a head injury which means he keeps walking round in circles. Mr Clegg was told the animals have a lifespan of just five years, which he might be able to relate to as his party faces the prospect of being booted out of government for the first time since 2010. Nick Clegg and Lib Dem candidate Lorely Burt were introduced to Humpty, a hedgehog with a head injury which means he keeps walking round in circles . He took a short break from campaigning to take part in Go Ape Haldon Forest Park near Exeter on Wednesday . The Deputy Prime Minister tested the water, but declined to take a dip, during a visit to Bath Spa on April 6 . Mr Clegg faced a grilling from TOWIE star Joey Essex, who seemed a little confused about the Liberal Democrats’ name . Since then he has flown down a zipwire at a Go Ape park, tested the water at Bath Spa, planted flowers in Newtown, painted a picture at a nursery in Sheffield and watched racing wheels coming off the production in Chippenham. Food and drink has played a big part in the campaign too, from pulling pints in a Bath pub, to sipping cocktails in the sun in Southampton. He was even presented with cakes with his own face printed on them during a visit to the marginal seat of Poole and Mid Dorset. After launching the party's NHS manifesto, he was grilled by TOWIE star Joey Essex, who seemed a little confused about the Liberal Democrats’ name. Mr Clegg had to patiently explain that the party was not called ‘Demo-cats’, after Essex wondered why it had such a ‘weird’ name.’ ‘I’ve been Deputy Prime Minister for the last five years,’ Mr Clegg added. ‘That’s sick. I sort of rule Essex. I was going to say, someone else will be Prime Minister next? Are you going to be Prime Minister?' The Lib Dem leader, currently on around 8 per cent in the polls, had to admit this was unlikely. But the pair parted amicable, but not before posing for a selfie. The Lib Dem leader is touring the country in a bright yellow election battlebus fitted out with a radio studio to allow him to continue his regular broadcasts designed to drum up support before May 7 . Food and drink has never been far from the campaign, including pulling pint at the Green Park brasserie in Bath, with Lib Dem candidate Wera Hobhouse looking on . When Mr Clegg invited the ITV cameras into his home for a profile, he was seen glugging on white wine while wife Miriam spoke about the pressure of politics on family life . Mr Clegg has been seen drinking real lemonade in Holt, Wiltshire, a Banana Wharf Liberal Cocktail as he talks in Southampton and coffee in Kingston and Surbiton . A cupcake featuring the faces of Mr Clegg and Vikki Slade, the Lib Dem candidate in Mid Dorset and North Poole . A source close to Mr Clegg said: 'Nick as a leader of a major political party has always tried to do things differently. This election campaign is no different. 'It's lively, it's fun. He is interacting with normal people, doing things that they do every day, whether it is ten-pint bowling or going down the pub. 'The key is to get out there and get him talking to people in their ordinary environment. 'We are lucky to have a leader in Nick who is up for doing anything. He is not afraid of a bacon sandwich.' Labour leader Ed Miliband, who famously struggled to eat a bacon sandwich for the cameras, has been criticised for appearing throughout the election campaign in front of a red Labour backdrop. It was all child's play as he tried his hand at painting at the Old School House Nursery School in Crosspool near Sheffield . He watered and tended some some plants during a visit to the mental health charity The Ponthafren Association, in Newtown . On a visit to Dymag, a specialist manufacturer of high performance racing wheels in Chippenham, Wiltshire there were inevitable jokes about the wheels coming off the Lib Dem campaign . Before setting off for an afternoon ten-pin bowling, Mr Clegg used a speech in London to warn Conservative plans to raise billions of pounds from the 'grubby hands of scroungers' will not work. The Lib Dem leader promised to 'spread the burden' of deficit reduction, with cuts to welfare and Whitehall budgets along with tax rises aimed at the very wealthy. Car tax would rise by £25-a-year. But he scaled back his plans for a mansion tax, amid concern it could cost the party support in key seats in affluent parts of London. Mr Clegg set out plans for £5billion in new tax rises, £7billion raised from a crackdown on tax avoidance, £12 billion in public spending reductions and a £3 billion cut from welfare. But he mocked George Osborne's insistence that another £12billion can be found from the welfare budget. Mr Clegg warned that it was 'quite simply impossible' to find savings on that scale without causing 'real pain to millions of families' and some of the most vulnerable people.","Lib Dem leader embarks on bizarre photo opportunities to stay in the news .

"Scientists claim to have established which diets are most likely to work - and keep the weight off in the long term . From high protein to low fat, calorie counters to slimming shakes, we are bombarded by diet plans promising  the holy grail of weight loss. But if you just can't shed the pounds - or keep them off - then help may be at hand. A landmark report claims to have established which diets are most likely to work - and keep the weight off in the long term. The US researchers say very few of these - often very expensive - weight loss plans have solid evidence to back up their claims. In fact, the results suggest only a few programmes have shown their users lose more weight than those not using them. Others produce no better results than people dieting on their own or getting health information elsewhere, while some may actually be harmful to health. Crucially, very few have been shown to keep the weight off permanently. But a handful - including Weight Watchers, the Atkins diet, Jenny Craig and NutriSystem - do appear to be effective, according to long-term studies. The research, from Johns Hopkins University, was prompted by doctors seeing an increasing number of obese or overweight patients wanting to join popular slimming clubs or diet plans. The researchers say reliable proof of which ones work has become increasingly important as doctors and health bosses come under increasing pressure to tackle the obesity epidemic. To draw their conclusions, they first reviewed 4,200 studies involving these diets for solid evidence of effectiveness. However only a few dozen of the studies met the scientific gold standard of reliability - using properly controlled clinical trials. Scroll down for video . Because of this, they ended up examining 11 programs in detail. Three 'high-intensity' programmes were included: Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig and NutriSystem. These incorporate goal setting, self-monitoring, nutritional information and counselling. There were three very-low-calorie meal replacement programmes: HMR, Medifast and OPTIFAST. Five 'self-directed' programmes, Atkins, SlimFast, and the internet-based Biggest Loser Club, eDiets and Lose It!, were also looked at. Of the 11 plans, some were free while those that required replacement meals could cost up to between £380 ($570) and £460 ($682) per month. The high protein, low cab Atkins diet scored well: This was because there was 'gold-standard data' showing that people following the diet lost more weight after one year than those people either dieting on their own or getting health and diet information elsewhere . The researchers say only two programmes are supported by gold-standard data showing that enrolled dieters - on average - lost more weight after one year than those either dieting on their own or getting health and diet information elsewhere. EVIDENCE OF LONG-TERM SUCCESS: Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig . EVIDENCE OF SHORT-TERM SUCCESS: . NutriSystem produced more weight loss at three months than counselling or education alone, but researchers were unable to find any long-term trials . Very-low-calorie meal replacement dieters lost more weight than people not using them in trials lasting 4-6 months. But the only long-term study showed no benefit from such a programme at 12 months. Programmes based on the Atkins diet - high in fat, low in carbohydrates - also helped people lose more weight at six months and 12 months than counseling alone and the approach 'appears promising'. NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO JUDGE: . Slim-Fast and the Internet-based programmes: Biggest Loser Club, eDiets and Lose It! Results were generally 'modest', with participants losing on average between three and five per cent more weight than the studies’ control groups who did not take part. Based on the analysis of the studies, Jenny Craig and Weight Watchers were backed by clinical trials that lasted 12 months or longer and showed those enrolled had a greater weight loss than those not following the plan. NutriSystem also produced more weight loss at three months than counselling or education alone, but researchers were unable to find any long-term trials of that plan. People on very-low-calorie meal replacement plans lost more weight than many other dieters in the first four to six months. But there was only one long-term study, which showed no benefit from such a programme at 12 months. But these diets also carry higher risks of complications, such as gallstones, the researchers found. Programmes based on the Atkins diet - high in fat, low in carbohydrates - also helped people lose more weight at six months and 12 months than counseling alone and the approach 'appears promising'. But no definite conclusions could be made about Slim-Fast and the internet-based programmes, they say. Jeanne Clark, professor of medicine, said: 'We want people to experience the health benefits of weight loss - lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar, and lower risk of developing diseases like diabetes . People on very-low-calorie meal replacement plans lost more weight than many other dieters in the first four to six months. But there was only one long-term study, which showed no benefit from such a programme at 12 months. 'Those benefits are long-term goals - so losing weight for three months, then regaining it, has limited health benefits. 'That’s why it’s important to have studies that look at weight loss at 12 months and beyond.' Dr Kimberly Gudzune assistant professor of medicine, added: 'Clinicians could consider referring patients who are overweight or obese to Weight Watchers or Jenny Craig. 'Other popular programmes, such as NutriSystem, show promising weight-loss results, but additional studies evaluating long-term outcomes are needed.' The findings, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, come with a call for more rigorous tests of the programs for longer periods of time, so effectiveness can be better judged. The authors added: 'Doctors need to know which programmes have rigorous trials showing they work, but they haven’t had much evidence to rely on. 'Our review should give clinicians a better idea of what programmes they might consider for their patients.' The researchers looked at the evidence for 11 different weight loss plans . Weight Watchers: A calorie controlled diet, which assigns every food a points value, based on its protein, carbohydrate, fat and fibre. Choices that fill a person up the longest 'cost' the least, and nutritious foods cost less than those with 'empty' calories, such as junk food. Atkins: Involves limiting carbohydrates and increasing the proportion of protein and fat in the diet. Designed to 'flip the body's metabolic switch' from burning carbs to burning fat. Claims to limit blood sugar and insulin spikes, which cause hunger and cravings, and result in overeating and weight gain. Jenny Craig: A diet in which people are able to choose from a range of pre-packaged, microwaveable meals, which they can supplement with vegetables, wholegrains and low-fat dairy. Dieters discuss meal plans with a counsellor and also have access to an advice helpline. NutriSystem: A prepaid meal plan with 28 days of meals delivered to the dieter’s door, which can be supplemented with fresh fruit and vegetables. Menus provide a mix of low-glycaemic carbohydrates, fibre, and lean protein. HMR: A meal replacement system, including shakes and microwave meals, supplemented with fresh fruit and vegetables. Biggest Loser Club: Online weight loss plan linked to the brutal TV show of the same name. Dieters get meal plans, online workout videos and online support. SlimFast: Involves substituting two daily meals with an energy-restricted replacement. Products include powders, shakes, meal bars and snacks. eDiets: Online weight loss tool with 'a variety of digital diet plans, nutritional products and supplements to help members'. Medifast: Consists of pre-planned meals which create a calorie-deficit to aid weight loss. Products include shakes, smoothies, bars, crisps, cereals and soups. Lose it! Helps users set a daily calorie budget, track their food intake and exercise, and 'stay motivated to make smarter choices'. Optifast: Meal replacement plan including shakes, soups, bars, protein drinks and vitamin, mineral and fibre supplements.","Researchers examined 4,200 studies and selected 11 weight loss plans .

"A spring storm that had doused Northern California for the previous 24 hours arrived in Southern California on Tuesday night, bringing mostly light but necessary rainfall across a region that has been experiencing extreme drought conditions. Thousands were without power for several hours because of the storm, and the Los Angeles Dodgers had a rare rain delay on the second day of the season, though there wasn't nearly enough moisture for a rainout. Amy Jackson, 35, of Los Angeles, a corporate securities paralegal, expressed joy as she had a cigarette in the lee of a downtown skyscraper.

Snow, too: Susan Feist leaves her store Feist Wines as hail falls in Amador City, California on Tuesday as an unusually cold spring storm brought heavy rain and hail to parts of Northern California . 'We're absolutely thrilled to have rain,' she said. 'It's been scary, actually, as to how low our reservoirs have gotten ... so to even have this little bit, it's great.' Earlier in the day, the unusually cold spring storm brought heavy rain and hail to parts of Northern California and coated the mountains in snow - a welcome respite but one that will do little to ease the historic drought, forecasters say. The storm brought enough snow to the Sierra near Lake Tahoe to produce near white-out conditions on roadways and a string of traffic accidents that caused the California Highway Patrol to order motorists off a 15 mile-stretch of a major highway on Tuesday afternoon. In the Sierra, up to 6 inches of snow was expected above 7,000 feet, with 2 to 4 inches expected to accumulate as low as 3,000 feet before the system clears out Wednesday. Moving on: A man rides his bicycle around a flooded section of roadway as demolition continues in the background at Candlestick Park Tuesday, April 7, 2015, in San Francisco . Motorists on the CA-101 freeway face rainy weather in Los Angeles on Tuesday. The storm dumped rain in parts of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and promised three to four hours of steady rain later in the day to parts of Los Angeles County . Rainbow: A section of the California aqueduct with a rainbow in the background is pictured in Palmdale, California . More than an inch fell on some counties in the San Francisco Bay Area, where rainy weather slowed the morning commute, caused some wrecks and led to wind advisories for four bridges, officials said. In Daly City, south of San Francisco, at least one car was submerged in rainwater that was flooding Interstate 280 on-ramps. In Fremont, a tractor-trailer jack-knifed before sunrise, blocking northbound Interstate 680 for several hours. Gilbert Jaffe, a retired Boeing engineer, was scooping up buckets of the stuff during brief rains Tuesday night and carrying it into barrels in his backyard near downtown Los Angeles. 'I've been collecting water for a couple of years,' Jaffe said. 'I use the rainwater for my garden.' He said he'd been watering his tomatoes and peppers for six weeks with rain he collected during a bigger storm in February, and hoped his new take could continue his no-tap-water streak.

Fresno County Farmer Keith Nilmeier needs the rain for sure. Nilmeier grows 320 acres of citrus, peaches and wine grapes. The rain will force him to spray his trees with fungicide to keep fruit from rotting. But Nilmeier said it is worth the extra expense, because California needs the water. He expects the storm to drop up to half an inch, and with a little more he may have to irrigate one less time this summer. 'That's farming,' he said. 'You deal with Mother Nature on her own terms.' The rain and snowfall is a big change from last week, when Gov. Jerry Brown, attending the last snowpack survey of the season, stood in dry, brown grass at a site normally covered in snow this time of year and announced he had ordered cities and towns to cut the state's overall water usage by 25 percent compared with 2013 levels. The snowpack makes its way into rivers and streams and provides 30 percent of the state's water. Sign of the times: A sign along Interstate 5 reading 'Stop the Congress Created DUST BOWL' is pictured in the Central Valley of California. California governor Jerry Brown ordered the state's first-ever mandatory water cuts on 01 April, in the fourth year of a devastating drought that has dried up wells, forced mandatory rationing and jeopardized crops in one of the largest agricultural producing regions in the world .

"Police in Idaho are trying to track down the man who saved a driver from the scene of a precarious car crash at the edge of a cliff in Idaho yesterday. The crash occurred about 8am Wednesday in Lewiston, at a drop called Bryden Canyon. The driver of the truck involved, Mathew Sitko, 23, drove through a yard and over two terraces before getting snared in a chain-link fence. The fence is the only reason the car vehicle did not topple over into the canyon with Sitko still behind the wheel, police told the Lewiston Tribune. Scroll down for videos . Incredible rescue: Police in Lewiston, Idaho, are looking for this passer-by who pulled driver Matthew Sitko, 23, from his car that was dangling over a cliff on Wednesday. Sitko crashed through the adjoiningg property and would have driven off the drop if it weren't for the chain-link fence . That's when the mystery man arrived at the scene. The man, a passer-by, grabbed a nearby rock and smashed Sitko's window, before pulling the victim from the car. He dragged Sitko further up to safety, where police and paramedics arrived shortly after to assist. 'He said he had to go, and he left,' Lewiston police officer Eric Olson told the Tribune. Driver: Mathew Sitko, 23, of Lewiston, Idaho, is recovering in hospital from minor injuries following the crash. He wrote on his Facebook page that he feels 'blessed' for what happened . Sitko was taken to hospital and is recovering from minor injuries, however he is lucky to be alive. It is unclear how far the canyon drop actually measured. Witnesses say Sitko was driving erratically and swerved to miss another motorist when the crash occurred. While police are investigating, they say he appeared to suffer a 'mental episode'. Not long after the crash Sitko posted to his Facebook page that he felt blessed. 'Good morning everyone! I am truly blessed by God today!! Thank you God & Jesus for taking care of me!! I love you!' he wrote on his Facebook. Sitko lists his job as working for Moscow and Lewiston Landscaping.","Crash occurred in Lewiston, Idaho, about 8am Wednesday .

"Intel has shown of a terrifying glimpse of the future - a swarm of robot spiders that can be controlled with a flick of the wrist. At the chip giant's developers forum in China, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich revealed the demonstration to show off the firm's button sized computed and controller wristband. He was able to cause lights on the robots to change shape, and control their movement from the bans. Scroll down for video . Intel CEO Brian Krzanich controlling the four spiderbots with a smart wristband . The robots were powered by Curie, a computer the size of a button developed by Intel. 'Today, I want to show you another example of Curie,' he explained. 'We put together a small wristband that can be used and has Curie on it. 'We connected Curie to these robots, spiderbots we call them, and they are talking to each other. 'My motions will control them. To wake the robots, he lifted his hand. 'They're excited to be here today'. 'Here's my favourite bit, I've got make sure I do this right', he said, before fistbumping - with the spiders following. He was then able to put the spiderbots to 'sleep' with another gesture. 'This is just the beginning our work with Curie, he said. 'The curie wristband can understand motion, and actually interpret if you're running, walking of swimming,' said Krzanich . 'The Intel Curie module is a tiny hardware product based on the Intel Quark SE system chip, which is the company's first purpose-built system on a chip for wearable devices,' the firm said. It contains Bluetooth low-energy radio, sensors and battery charging technologies. Krzanich said that there's a dedicated sensor hub processor and pattern classification engine that allows it, for example, to identify different sporting activities quickly and precisely. Intel also unveiled a tiny wearable computer, called Curie, that is the size of a small button. While the Curie hardware is based on Intel's first purpose-built system-on-chip (SoC) for wearable devices and is expected to ship to manufacturing partners in the second half of this year. Packed into the tiny computer is Bluetooth, sensors and battery charging capabilities. It will help firms make smaller smartwatches and other wearables. 'The curie wristband can understand motion, and actually interpret if you're running, walking of swimming,' said Krzanich. At the annual event, Krzanich stressed the need for Intel and the developer community to provide leading- edge technologies to China that drive differentiation across a range of products and industries – from the data center to PC and mobile devices to wearables, as well as the Internet of Things (IoT). The robots are controlled by a wristband containing Intel's Curie computer the size of a button. Lowering his hand caused to robots to 'sleep'. He also emphasized the importance of the maker community to develop new generations of computing and connected solutions. 'The local and global impact of our 50 years of Moore's Law innovation and 30 years of strong collaboration and winning together in China is unmatched,' said Krzanich. 'Intel remains focused on delivering leadership products and technologies in traditional areas of computing, while also investing in new areas and entrepreneurs – students, makers and developers – to find and fuel future generations of innovation with China.' .

It is not Intel's first move into arachnid-based systems. Earlier this year the chip giant showed off a tablet that can use hand gestures to scroll a recipe, drones  that can manoeuvre an obstacle course without human intervention and even smart clothing that can help the visually impaired navigate safely - and a smart cocktail dress that can repel people who invade the wearer's space. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich also used the keynote at the Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas to show off the company's RealSense technology for seeing and understanding depth. 'The rise of new personal computing experiences, intelligent and connected devices, and the wearable revolution are redefining the relationship between consumers and technology,' he said. Intel also showed off experimental designer Anouk Wipprecht's latest Spider Dress. 'Fashion and tech are merging at the moment, beyond blinking dresses or cute skirts, she said. 'I'm showing how fashion can be thought provoking, something that pushes people to think and share their feelings. Ther 3D-printed experimental dress crowned at the collar with robotic spider legs which move. 'Spider Dress acts as the interface between the body and the external world,' said Wipprecht. 'It uses technology and the garment as a medium of interaction.' The so-called animatronic arachnid limbs on the Spider Dress know exactly when someone is invading the wearer's personal space. The legs are driven by computer and sensor technologies that allow it to be autonomous, but assistive and adaptive to the owner's emotions and desires. 'Since the system based with mechanic spider legs is literally hosted on the shoulders of the wearer and attacks using the same viewing angle as the wearer, the system knows how you feel and adapts to those feelings,' she said.

Using wireless biometric signals, the system makes inferences based on the stress levels in your body. It can differentiate between 12 states of behavior. Wipprecht calls it an interesting interplay between co-control and education of your own body and mind. 'When approached at an aggressive pace, the system answers in a territorial attack mode,' she said. 'But when you walk up to the dress in a more cautious, friendly symbiotic way, you can almost get the dress to invite you closer, as if to 'dance' with you.' CEO Brian Krzanich also used a keynote Tuesday to show off the company's RealSense technology for seeing and understanding depth, showing off: . •Food Network with Intel RealSense 3D Camera: Intel and Food Network have collaborated to create a cooking application that uses Intel RealSense technology to eliminate the need to touch the device and instead use gesture control and voice commands on an Intel RealSense 3D camera enabled device for easy scrolling through the application and navigation of recipes in real time. This will be available in the Spring of 2015. •All-in-one PC with 3D Display Concept: Intel showcased a futuristic '3D I/O' technology that integrates Intel RealSense technology with a specialized glass screen to enable an immersive, hologram-like experience without the need for additional eyewear. •Intel RealSense technology and wearables: Looking into the future, Krzanich also demonstrated a wearable technology research project that can help vision-impaired people navigate their environments more easily and safely. The wearable solution places sensors on clothing, equipped with Intel RealSense 3D cameras that sense the vicinity and trigger vibrations as a feedback mechanism, helping people to navigate their environment. •Intel RealSense technology inside Robotics and Multi-copter drone: Intel demonstrated an iRobot® AVA® 500 video collaboration robot equipped with Intel RealSense cameras to support the platform's autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance technologies. In addition, Intel highlighted the growing possibilities for multi-copter drones, including the inspection of fields and power lines, delivering goods, and even monitoring endangered species. As these drones become smarter, they can see, react, and even move safely through the environment. During the CES keynote, Intel created a make-shift obstacle course inside the CES keynote ballroom and demonstrated a number of AscTec* Firefly multi-copter drones equipped with Intel RealSense cameras that provide 360-degree sensing and enabled with unique collision avoidance capabilities. Intel's RealSense camera module, which weighs as little as 8 grams and is less than 4mm thick, brings depth perception to drones both indoors and outdoors with minimal impact to payload and flight times. Intel hopes to put the realsense system into laptops and tablets. The Intel RealSense technology of software and depth cameras enables more natural and intuitive interaction with personal computing devices, the firm says. Cutting-edge facial detection and tracking, emotion detection, 3D scanning, depth-sensing photography, background removal, and the tracking of 22 joints in each hand for accurate touch-free gesture recognition are some of the new capabilities made possible with Intel RealSense technology.

Favourite: Perkins (right), who hosts the hit baking programme with Mel Giedroyc (left), is ahead of former X-factor presenter Dermot O'Leary and British model Jodie Kidd for the appointment . The firm's spokesperson Nicola McGeady said: 'This latest gamble suggests that Sue Perkins is being lined up to replace Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear. 'When betting first opened on Clarkson's successor, it was one-way traffic for Jodie Kidd and now today's flutter has convinced us that a female is in the driving seat.' Clarkson's future at the BBC remains uncertain but he will be back on the channel later this month to host satirical quiz show Have I Got News For You. The corporation investigated the ousted Top Gear presenter after he attacked one of the show's producers, splitting his lip and abusing him in a 30-second verbal assault on March 4. He was initially suspended by the broadcaster on March 10 for the attack on Oisin Tymon, before it announced his contract would not be renewed. Prime Minister David Cameron was one of the many famous faces to lend his support to Clarkson in the aftermath, while over one million people signed a petition urging the BBC to reinstate him. But director-general Tony Hall said 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. Clarkson will appear on stage with his former Top Gear colleagues Richard Hammond and James May later this year to fulfil a series of shows planned before he left the BBC. Exodus: Clarkson's departure has sparked rumours that former fellow-presenters Richard Hammond (left) and James May (right) may also quit the hugely successful show . The gigs will be stripped of all BBC branding and instead be presented as 'Clarkson, Hammond and May Live'. That means the show which will tour Australia, Norway, South Africa and the UK will not be able to use clips from the show - or even feature The Stig. The move has sparked rumours that all three men could team up to continue their careers together  but sources close to the tour claim it is just a matter of fulfilling commitments to the fans. The future of the show's other two presenters - Hammond and May - is also unclear with both men's Top Gear contracts having run out.","Bookmakers Coral have Sue Perkins as favourite to replace ousted Clarkson .

"Iain Duncan Smith has launched a scathing attack on Labour's 'politics of hate and envy' and claimed the Conservatives are 'the real party of work'. The Work and Pensions Secretary said Ed Miliband was standing on 'the most Left-wing platform since Michael Foot' and was 'peddling lies' about the Government's record. In an interview with the Daily Mail, the former Conservative leader set out a powerful moral case for the party's policies, which have reduced welfare dependency and got two million more into work. Scroll down for video . Urging action: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, left, called on fellow Tories to 'bang the drum' in the next fortnight to champion the Government's achievements. Right, Labour leader Ed Miliband . 'Labour doesn't understand work. They don't understand the importance of work in a cultural, social and health sense,' he said. 'Instead they're saying ""here are the people we hate"". They hate people who get up early in the morning and work to get a business off the ground, they hate people who take risks, hate people that earn money, hate people that create jobs. 'They are reinventing the politics of envy. It's alive and well. Labour is picking enemies. It's the politics of fear. It isn't a message of hope.' Mr Duncan Smith called on fellow Tories to 'bang the drum' in the next fortnight to champion the Government's achievements – and persuade voters that Britain's best days lie ahead if it sticks to its current economic course. Hailing the 'staggering' increase in employment, now at a record high, he insisted: 'There are more disabled people in work than under Labour, the proportion of people in social housing who have a job is higher than it has been since records began. 'All these people that have gone back into work are lives saved in my book. Success: The Work and Pensions Secretary  hailed the 'staggering' increase in employment, now at a record high. Above, Prime Minister David Cameron on the campaign trail in Horstforth, Yorkshire today . 'Everything I have done – the cap on benefits, the work experience for young kids, changes to sickness benefits – we really do care about people. 'Labour thinks welfare and work are two sides of the same coin. They are not. We want to catch people when they fall, but we must get them to rise out of welfare dependency.' The Work and Pensions Secretary said Labour had made a 'staggering misjudgement' when it claimed the Government's austerity measures would put one million people out of work. 'They have been out by a factor of three million. In fact there are two million more in work,' he said. 'We know Ed Miliband and Ed Balls were party to the government that misjudged the public finances so dramatically, despite all the warnings that we were running a deficit that was too high. 'Not only did they not fix the roof when the sun was shining, they smashed the tiles off. 'That meant when the crisis came we were least prepared. It became what was actually for the UK the worst depression since at least the 1920s. 'Not only can they not run an economy, they can't even forecast anything correctly. Every proposal they have made as an opposition has been a joke. Every solution involves looking to the past and the state spending more money. 'They have never understood why they were wrong. They have learned nothing - absolutely nothing - since the financial crisis. 'That's why every Labour government leaves office with unemployment higher than when they came into power. 'They think governments create jobs. They don't. The government can set the conditions by which businesses can thrive: lower taxes, less regulation, give entrepreneurs a reason to stay in the UK and create jobs here. Defence: The former Conservative leader, pictured on Good Morning Britain last week, set out a powerful moral case for the party's policies, which have reduced welfare dependency and got two million more into work . 'What Labour does is start to force up taxes, spend far too much, lose control of the public finances. 'The economy suffers, people lose their jobs and the lowest-paid bear the brunt.' Mr Duncan Smith claimed that having lost the argument on jobs, Labour was now deliberately misleading people about the nature of the employment created, suggesting it is mainly part-time and low-paid. 'They peddle lies about the jobs. Actually 80 per cent are full-time, 60 per cent are managerial level jobs. 60 to 70 per cent are going to British-born citizens, compared to the 90 per cent of jobs that were going to foreign nationals under Labour,' he said. 'These aren't my figures - they're official Offical for National Statistics figures. Yet Labour rattles its chains like a character from Dickens and says everything is dreadful. 'Now people have been really hurt by the Great Recession that Labour oversaw. We can't expect people to run round and say ""hooray"" when we have started to turn things around. 'Their faith in the political system has been damaged. After all, Labour promised they'd ended boom and bust. 'But we've stuck to our guns and people are starting to feel the pound in their pocket. We have incomes rising at two per cent in the private sector. Things like fuel, heating and food prices have been falling. 'The greatest risk we face is that the job is not completed. Labour is peddling this myth that somehow we can start spending more money that we haven't got.' He said Labour was also seeking to mislead voters about the future of the NHS, though they have not matched the Tories' pledge to give it £8billion a year in extra funding. 'They set out to scare people - to believe something nasty is happening. Take the NHS - they say the Conservatives are going to damage or destroy the NHS. It is an appalling lie,' he said. The Work and Pensions Secretary warned that a Labour government 'would be a prisoner to two groups - not just the SNP, but also their own backbenchers'. 'The vast majority of Labour MPs do not believe in any element of deficit reduction. They think we should tax people on any more than average earnings and they want welfare payments to increase dramatically.,' he said. Mr Duncan Smith warned Labour would halt his programme to replace all out-of-work benefits and tax credits with a new universal credit, which ensures it always pays more to take a job or more hours than remain on benefits. He also revealed that the new benefit will be denied to EU immigrants to deter low-paid incomers. Mr Duncan Smith said he wanted immigrants to wait for four years before they qualified, and had already opened talks with the EU Commission on introducing the lengthy time line.","Work and Pensions Secretary hailed the Tories as 'the real party of work'

"An Alabama mayor was arrested and a city police chief was taken to the hospital in an ambulance after a fight at city hall on Friday. Lipscomb police chief Warren Carey was trying to arrest Mayor Lance McDade when the fight broke out, according to a city clerk. McDade is currently in jail for resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer, city officials said. Carey was later spotted 'hobbling' into his office with an injured leg before he was transported to the hospital, according to FOX6 News. Lipscomb police chief Warren Carey (right) was trying to arrest Mayor Lance McDade (left), who refused to leave his office, when the fight broke out on Friday, according to a city clerk . City hall was shut down for the rest of the day and crews were changing the locks on the building, FOX6 News reporter Melanie Posey tweeted. McDade was holding a letter when he was arrested that read: 'Dear City of Liscomb employees, this letter is to inform you that all city employees are on administrative leave with pay until further notice. With exceptions for city dispatch.' McDade will be held in prison over the weekend. City clerk Connie Madsen said the mayor pro term, Brenda Renz, is now in charge of the city. Madsen told AL.com the investigation into the incident is ongoing and no formal charges have been filed against McDade yet. The city clerk said all of the employees were still working and no one has been put on leave. She said McDade has made it 'difficult' for the employees 'to function and do our jobs'. This is not the first time McDade, who was elected in November 2012, has gotten into trouble with the law. Both McDade and his wife were arrested and charged with domestic violence and harassment after police were called to their home last year and found they both had minor injuries. The couple had been arguing about how they were going to divide their property during their pending divorce, according to AL.com. The fight broke out at Lipscomb city hall (pictured). McDade is currently in jail for resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer, city officials said . Just two months following his arrest, McDade was found guilty of attempting to elude a police officer during a traffic violation. McDade fled from the officer first in his car and then on foot while trying to avoid arrest, according to the officer's statement in court documents. The mayor was also arrested in 2013, when he showed up to the scene of a fire and tried to force a volunteer fire department lieutenant to leave because he had recently dismissed her. McDade was arrested for obstructing governmental process after he allegedly refused to leave, even after a police officer told him she had authorized the lieutenant to be there, according to AL.com. And two years ago McDade temporarily shut down the entire city police department and laid off city employees because he said the city was having financial problems.","Lipscomb police chief Warren Carey was trying to arrest Mayor Lance McDade, who refused to leave his office when the fight broke out .

"Spain remains Britons' favourite destination to fly to, as it has been for more than 25 years, with its more than 34 million journeys in 2014 over double that of the next most popular, the United States. New figures from the UK Civil Aviation Authority shows 238m passengers passed through British airports in 2014, just three million less than the pre-recession boom peak of 241m in 2007 and 10m more (a 4.4 per cent rise) than 2013. As would be expected, most passengers (144m) fly to Europe which enjoyed a 5.4 per cent rise year on year in visitors from the UK. Perhaps surprisingly though, Germany proved a more visited destination even than France and Italy, which were all ranked behind Spain and the US and ahead of Ireland and the Netherlands. The United Arab Emirates also ranks in the top 10 countries British flyers most travel to and enjoyed the largest passenger increase in the past year with a 430,000 boost (7.4 per cent) to 6.2m. The UAE  ranked ahead of Portugal and Switzerland, who round out the top 10, and Turkey in 11th. While only the 12 most visited country by plane, Greece is the biggest improver over the past year with its 5.6 million incoming passengers from Britain a 13.2 per cent increase. While topping numerous polls as UK travellers' dream destination, Australia suffered the biggest drop in UK arrivals losing a third of visitors from 744,000 to 488,000. In Europe, the country with the largest fall in passengers was Poland with a minute drop of 0.1m to 5.2m. There has been a rise of 2.3 per cent in passengers flying to and from North America from the UK, which has now reached 21m per year. Travellers to and from other international destinations has now increased 3.7 per cent to 33.6m.

'This is fantastic news for the UK's strong aviation industry and with the economy likely to grow further in 2015, we can expect even more passengers flying abroad this year.

"The ethnic minority population in Britain will more than double by the middle of this century, meaning one in four Britons will be from black or minority groups by 2051, research shows. The huge rise will be due to a baby boom among Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and African immigrants who usually come to this country during their young, child bearing years. Campaigners fear that this sudden increase will put pressure on housing, schools and the NHS, and worsen the quality of life in Britain as a whole. A baby boom among ethnic minorities in the UK will see numbers rocket by the middle of the century, according to new data, with a quarter of Britons coming from a minority background by 2051 . The research, carried out by Leeds University and reported in The Times, shows that overall, between 2011 and 2051, the UK's population will rise from 63.4 million to 77.4 million. While the number of white Britons will increase over that time, by almost three million, the minority population will increase more than three times faster, by 10 million. By the midpoint of the 21st century, minority ethnic communities will make up 24.3 per cent of the total population, compared with 12.8 per cent during the 2011 census. In contrast the proportion of whites will drop from 87.2 per cent in 2011 to 75.7 per cent in 2015. The sudden rise in the ethnic minority population marks an increase on predictions from the same university just five years ago. In an almost identical study, published in July 2010, professors at Leeds University predicted that ethnic minorities would make up around a fifth of the total population by 2051. In the same study they also predicted that British society would become much more integrated, with those from ethnic minorities moving into more affluent areas. Professor Philip Rees, who led the project, said: 'The ethnic makeup of UK's population is evolving significantly. 'Groups outside the White British majority are increasing in size and share, not just in the areas of initial migration, but throughout the country and our projections suggest that this trend is set to continue through to 2051. While the white British population will increase between now and 2051, the minority population will increase nearly three times as fast, meaning they will make up a greater share of the population . 'At a regional level, ethnic minorities will shift out of deprived inner city areas to more affluent areas, which echoes the way white groups have migrated in the past. 'In particular black and Asian populations in the least deprived local authorities will increase significantly.' The new research is likely to cause anxiety for those pushing for greater control of British borders, including an in-out referendum on the EU, or a renegotiation of the open borders treaty. While the Conservatives pledged at the last election to cut net migration from 'the hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands', it now stands at just under 300,000 per year. While Cameron has promised a renegotiation of EU laws if reelected, followed by a referendum, the Tory manifesto only contains an 'ambition' to cut current migration. While Ed Miliband has admitted that Tony Blair's Labour government made mistakes on immigration, he has also failed to commit to targets, though he has insisted that all new migrants should be able to speak English. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan also announced yesterday that her department is conducting a review into the pressures that migrants put on schools. That echoes the concerns of researchers such as David Coleman, professor of demography at Oxford University, who said: 'Money of the consequences of large-scale migration are damaging. 'We do not need up to 13 million more people by the mid century. Almost all that increase will be immigrants and their children. It will not make the UK a happier or richer place. 'Crowding and congestion will have entirely negative effects, increasing pressure on schools, hospitals and particularly housing.'","Fastest growing groups will be from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Africa .

'All you need these days is a knife, a flag and a camera and one can commit a terrorist act,' he told reporters. Deputy Commissioner Phelan acknowledged police did not have the luxury of time in dealing with potential terrorism plots, unlike in drug investigations. They had to act as soon as they thought the public were at risk. Three of the five men who arrested after the raids were released following questioning for most of Saturday.

There may also be a place for Robert, the Earl of Grantham, and his wife Cora, who is American-born. Lord Fellowes told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Robert Grantham would be in his early teens, Cora would be a child. A young Violet could make an appearance.’ He said that plans for the series had yet to be finalised, adding: ‘We’ll have to see.’ Sources at NBC said last week the network ‘is buzzing’ about The Gilded Age, which will focus on the robber barons and get-rich-quick industrialists such as Cornelius Vanderbilt, John Jacob Astor and John D. Rockefeller who accumulated gigantic fortunes in the late 19th Century. The source said scouts were seeking ‘the American Downton’, saying: ‘One of the Vanderbilt mansions is a front-runner. Julian wants a month off after finishing Downton, but then it is full steam ahead.’ NBC President Robert Greenblatt told a meeting of TV critics he hoped The Gilded Age would ‘come to life sometime next season’ – which could mean it is on air as early as September. The sixth and final series of Downton Abbey goes out later this year on ITV. Set in 19th Century New York and focusing on the city's most privileged families, American-born Cora (played by Elizabeth McGovern) may also reappear .","Dame Maggie Smith's character may appear in American period drama .

"A 1921 application form to join the racist Ku Klux Klan organisation has emerged, which asks ‘are you of the white race or of a colored race?’ The form asks a further 19 questions ranging from the mundane, such as ‘what is your age?’, to the overtly sinister – ‘Do you believe in White Supremacy?’ At the top is an introduction implying that it is intended to be sent out to people whose friends have identified them as suitable recruits. Scroll down for video . A 1921 application form to join the racist Ku Klux Klan organisation has emerged . The form was purchased at an ephemera show – where collectibles are sold – by Delaware rare book dealer Ian Brabner, whose firm, Rare Americana, buys and sells 18th to early 20th century rare books and historical manuscripts. In a blog post Brabner explained that the numbers ‘8-2-21’ in the top left corner of the unused form would have stood for the date – August 2, 1921. He wrote: ‘You can assume there’s a fair amount of xenophobic sentiment and anxiety about the waves of immigration to America, in 1921, post World-War One. ‘On May 9, 1921, this was evidenced when Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act, aka, the Emergency Immigration Act of 1921 to counter the increased immigration to America.’ The form is ominously titled ‘Invisible Empire’, an alternative name for the clan at the time, born from founder Nathan Bedford Forrest’s claim that the group was ‘invisible’. The KKK was founded in 1866 in Tennessee, with Nathan Bedford Forrest becoming the first leader, or grand wizard, in 1867. Pictured are clan members in 1965 . The KKK's membership peaked in the 1920s at around four million. Today it's thought to number in the low thousands . It then says ‘we have been requested by one of your personal friends to get in touch with you, and inform you of this organisation’, before listing 20 questions to be answered. They also include ‘do you believe in the principles of a PURE Americanism?’, ‘are you a gentile or Jew?’ and ‘were your parents born in the United States of America?’ The KKK was founded in 1866 in Tennessee, with Forrest becoming the first leader, or grand wizard, in 1867. Its membership peaked in the 1920s at around four million. Today it's thought to number in the low thousands, with most people affiliated with it living in America's Deep South. It was recently revealed, meanwhile, that California had more active hate groups than any other state last year. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), California has 57 such groups, followed by Florida with 50, New York with 44, New Jersey with 40, and Pennsylvania with 38. Rounding out the top five were Texas with 36 hate groups, Tennessee with 29, Georgia with 28, and Virginia and Ohio tied with 27 each. Hawaii and Alaska were the only states to not have any hate groups, according to the SPLC. The organization said on its website 'All hate groups have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics. 'This list was compiled using hate group publications and websites, citizen and law enforcement reports, field sources and news reports. 'Websites appearing to be merely the work of a single individual, rather than the publication of a group, are not included in this list,' the organization wrote. 'Listing here does not imply a group advocates or engages in violence or other criminal activity.' Nationally, the SPLC said in its 'The Year in Hate and Extremism' report, which was published online this spring, that there were a total 784 active hate groups in the US.

"He has shown himself to be quite a philanthropist. And Leonardo DiCaprio is planning to improve the ecosystem of an entire island in his latest crusade as an environmental activist. The 40-year-old actor is launching a project that will transform a small island off the coast of Belize into an eco-resort and conservation area. According to a Friday report from the New York Times, the Wolf Of Wall Street star, along with a partner, purchased the 104-acre Blackadore Caye nearly a decade ago for $1.75 million. But he recently  teamed up with Paul Scialla, the chief executive of New York development firm Delos, to create the eco-conscious resort, with plans to open in 2018. 'It was like heaven on earth,' DiCaprio told the New York Times of his visit to the island in 2005. 'And almost immediately, I found this opportunity to purchase an island there.' Scroll down for video . Environmental mission: Leonardo DiCaprio bought Blackadore Caye, an unpopulated, private 104-acre Belizean island, in 2005 for $1.75 million, and now plans to build a luxury eco-resort there. Pictured here is an artists impression of a private villa on the island . 'It will change the world': The resort will have villas on a platform over the water, as well as artificial reefs with 'fish shelters' and other features that hope to rehabilitate the ailing area. It is set to open in 2018 . Ambitious: Renderings of the project show an arc-shaped platform with villas and artificial reefs and fish shelters underneath . The ambitious project, which they will be calling 'Blackadore Caye, a Restorative Island,' will be much like many other luxury resorts and include sprawling villas, infinity pools and beautiful views. But not only will the island revitalize its visitors, but also help restore the land itself, as it has endured deterioration from over-fishing, deforestation and an eroding coastline. The aim of DiCaprio and his partners is to rehabilitate the ecosystem of the area. Renderings of the ambitious project show an arc-shaped platform with villas over the water with artificial reefs and fish shelters underneath. The daily also reports that other features will include a nursery that will grow indigenous marine grass to support a manatee conservation area and mangrove trees replanted to replace invasive species. 'The main focus is to do something that will change the world,' said the Titanic actor. 'I couldn’t have gone to Belize and built on an island and done something like this, if it weren’t for the idea that it could be groundbreaking in the environmental movement.' Activist: DiCaprio, who earned a reported $25 million pay packet for The Wolf Of Wall Street, is known for working on environmental causes . The Times reports that the plan is to build 68 resort villas and 48 private house. Some will are expected to be sold privately, and cost between $5 million and $15 million each, while the others will be available to guests. Nearby luxury resorts cost about $2,000-a-night. The project will also be monitored by a talented team of scientists, designers and engineers who along with landscape architects will closely monitor the resort's impact on the island's environment. After a scuba diving trip in Belize back in 2005, DiCaprio bought the Blackadore Caye for $1.75million with Jeff Gram, who owns Cayo Espanto Island Resort, which is a luxury vacation spot nearby. Private island: The nearest town to Blackadore Caye is San Pedro, which is a 15 minute boat ride away. The tiny Blackadore Caye is currently unpopulated . Big plans: Blackadore Caye (pictured) is a 104-acre island in the Caribbean Sea owned by DiCaprio and a business partner. The two plan to work with scientists and a NYC design firm to develop a resort that will 'rehabilitate' the area, which is suffering . Tropical: DiCaprio hopes the island, when completed, will not only revitalize its visitors, but also help restore the land itself, as it has endured deterioration from over-fishing, deforestation and an eroding coastline. The Blood Diamond actor previously had an agreement with Four Seasons Hotels but the deal ultimately fell through, according to the publication. No doubt the ecotourism venture is right up DiCaprio's alley as the project's aim will certainly follow resorts before it that minimizes negative impact on a location and seeks to preserve natural resources. The actor is currently filming an adventure drama, The Revenant, alongside Tom Hardy. 'Paradise': The closest port to DiCaprio's island is the town of San Pedro, on the southern part of the island of Ambergris Caye in Belize . Tourism: San Pedro is a known vacation spot in Belize.

"The mother-of-five who police said threw her teenage daughter a party, played naked Twister with her friends and then had sex with an 18-year-old in the bathroom looked upset today as she walked outside her house. Rachel Lynn Lehnardt, 35, from Evans, Georgia, was spotted outside her house wearing a hooded jacket and workout clothes just days after being arrested. She was arrested on Saturday night and has been charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Scroll down for video . Rachel Lynn Lehnardt, 35, from Evans, Georgia, appeared to be stressed as she walked outside her house on Wednesday. She was arrested on Saturday after having a drunken party with her teenage daughter and daughter's friends . The mother-of-five has been charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and is out on bail . The details of the drunken party emerged when Lehnardt met with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor last Friday and told her about the wild party. The sponsor then contacted authorities. She told the woman that her children, who are aged between four and 16, were with their father when her oldest daughter texted her to ask if she could bring over some friends. Lehnardt allegedly responded: 'Come on, let's party', WJBF reported. When the teenagers arrived, she allegedly allowed them to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in her home, before she played naked Twister with them in the living room. See more video at WJBF . She allegedly threw the party at her home in Evans, Georgia, pictured, and lost custody of her children after the incident . She allegedly played naked Twister with the group of teens before she had sex with an 18-year-old male in the bathroom. She later had sex with her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend . While the youngsters continued playing, she allegedly went into a bathroom and had sex with an 18-year-old man, the sponsor told authorities. When she returned, she brought out sex toys and started to use them on herself in front of the teenagers, she told her sponsor, Augusta Crime reported. She later went to bed alone and around 3.30am, she awoke to find someone having sex with her, she told her sponsor. 'She stated at first she thought it was the 18-year-old from earlier, but then realized it was the 16-year-old who was in fact her daughter's boyfriend,' Lehnardt's sponsor told deputies. Lehnardt told police that she awoke to find the 16-year-old having sex with her and that it was her teenage daughter's boyfriend . She also allegedly used sex toys in front of the teenagers and showed her daughter explicit photos of her having sex with her current boyfriend . The daughter told her mother she felt guilty because the boyfriend's 10-inch penis was so large she could not have sex with him, and he needed to have sex with her mother instead. While the incident sounds as if the 16-year-old raped the mother, Sheriff's spokesman Captain Steve Morris said there was no evidence of a crime and no charges are pending against the boy. No sexual crime charges have been filed against Lehnardt because 16 is the legal age of consent. Lehnardt also allegedly told the sponsor that she had shown her daughter explicit photos, including of Lehnardt having sex with her current boyfriend. The sponsor said that the mother has also previously spoken about being a porn addict. Following the incident, an emergency custody hearing was held and she lost custody of her five children, who are aged four, six, eight, 10 and 16, WJBF reported. Police became aware for the incident after Lehnardt told her Alcohol Anonymous sponsor about the party thrown in her Evans home (neighborhood pictured), and the sponsor alerted the Columbia County Sheriff's Office . At their meeting last week, the sponsor asked Lehnardt how long she had been sober and her future plans for sobriety, and the mother told her about losing custody of the children days before. After their meeting, the woman, who was only recently assigned to sponsor Lehnardt, contacted the Columbia County Sheriff's Office and the mother was arrested on Saturday. She has been released from the Columbia County Detention Center after posting a $3,200 bond, according to the Columbia County News-Times. According to online profiles, Lehnardt crafts and paints dolls. The children's father is in the military. Lehnardt was arrested after sharing details of the incident with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, who then went to authorities. As part of the AA's 12 Step program, members write a list of incidents they feel guilty about and confide in their sponsor about the acts (known as the Fifth Step). The person is then required to make amends for past wrongdoings, as long as doing so does not cause harm to others. While there is an expectation of anonymity at meetings, there is no guarantee, and experts recommend exercising caution when detailing crimes, according to The Fix. AA literature simply states that 'anonymity provides protection for all members from identification as alcoholics'. The main 'Understanding Anonymity' booklet does not mention safety from disclosure of a crime and there have been multiple cases of AA members being convicted of crimes, including, murder after confessing to their sponsors. But there has also been some debate over whether the confessions can be used in court. In 2001, a 1995 murder conviction was thrown out after it was ruled that a killer's confession to fellow AA members was constitutionally protected and shouldn't have been used against him. The decision was reached after the judge deemed the 12 Step program had religious undertones, meaning that the members engaged in  religious activity, which is constitutionally protected.","Rachel Lehnardt, 35, 'allowed her 16-year-old daughter and her friends drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in her Georgia home'

It said the he had died of gunshot wounds but did not say whether it was believed to be homicide or suicide. Scroll down for video . The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said Oleg Kalashnikov (pictured), a former member of the Ukrainian parliament, was found dead Wednesday evening . Kalashnikov was a former ally of deposed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych (pictured) Kalashnikov was a deputy for the Party of Regions in Ukraine's previous parliament. At least six former Ukrainian government officials from Yanukovych's time have died over the past two months in various circumstances that police have said were most likely suicides. Yanukovych fled in February 2014 after months of increasingly violent protests. He later resurfaced in Russia. Senior ministry official Anton Gerashchenko said . Kalashnikov, 52, had knowledge of the 'Anti-Maidan' movement, . which opposed pro-Western protests that ousted Yanukovich, suggesting this might be a motive for his alleged murder. The ministry had opened up a criminal case, he said. There were mass protests against Yanukovych last year in Kiev's Maidan Square . 'Without doubt the deceased knew a lot about who financed . Anti-Maidan and in what way... He takes these secrets with him . to the grave,' Gerashchenko said. On Thursday, meanwhile, a prominent Ukrainian journalist known for his pro-Russian views was shot dead  in Kiev by two masked gunmen. Oles Buzina, 45, was known for his pro-Russian opinionpieces published in Ukraine's Sevodnya daily newspaper, which is part of the media empire of Ukraine's richest businessman RinatAkhmetov.

"A Japanese bullet train has broken the speed record for rail vehicles by reaching 366mph (589km/h). The Maglev train completed a test run on a track in Yamanashi, beating the previous record of 361mph (580km/h) set in 2003. Another attempt is scheduled for tomorrow, and engineers at the Central Japan Railway Company predict it could reach 373mph (600km/h). Scroll down for video . A Japanese bullet train has broken the speed record for rail vehicles by reaching 366mph (589km/h) Maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track. This eliminates the need for wheels and therefore any incidence of friction, providing a faster and quieter service. Acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains. And maglev also makes for much smoother journeys. Right now speeds are limited at up to 400 kilometres (250 miles) per hour due to the excessive air resistance encountered at these speeds. But vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future. The seven-car train was able to go so fast because it made use of a magnetic charge to lift and move it above a guideway. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds, however, won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027. According to engineers, the trains will travel at 314mph (505km/h), which will cut the journey time for a 178-mile journey by more than half. For comparison, the UK's HS2 rail line will run at 224mph (360km/h). The Maglev trains are expected to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time. Japan is well-established as the world leader in high-speed trains, having developed the first 'bullet train' in 1964 . It is now hoping to bring the technology to the US and has outlined plans for a line between Washington and Baltimore, which will cut travel times between the cities to just 15 minutes. Maglev was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century. The first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively low-speed shuttle at Birmingham International Airport in 1984. This travelled at a rather mundane 26mph (42km/hr). It was not until the turn of the century, though, that high-speed maglev would come into commercial operation, mostly in Japan and China. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027 . China was the first country to have a commercially-operated Maglev service. The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (£830million) to build. Manufacturers claim that Maglev technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities. But not everyone is convinced that the technology is safe. Andy Kunz, president of the US High Speed Rail Association. told the Los Angeles Times that maglev trains have proved to be expensive, power-intensive, and potentially unsafe. 'The problem is if you have one tiny little settling of the Earth - which happens all the time because of plate tectonics - that can create little movements in the maglev system, which can send trains crashing into stuff,' he said. China was the first country to have a commercially-operated Maglev service. The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (£830million) to build . 'It's a very difficult system to make operational.' A new development called super-maglev could be set to push the limits even higher. Last year, China's first manned megathermal superconducting maglev was been tested successfully by the Applied Superconductivity Laboratory of Southwest Jiaotong University. The technology works by using a vacuum tube to decrease the speed limitations imposed by air resistance on regular maglev trains. 'ETT (Evacuated Tube Transport) systems might allow HTS Maglev trains to attain speeds in a new order of magnitude, such as super-high 3,000km (1,800 miles) per hour, which could be applied to some military or space launch systems,' the researchers write.

"Breathtaking scenery, beautiful castles and that signature Scottish hospitality. These are just some of the reasons that Scotland has recently been named the most popular wedding destination in the UK, according to a survey by the country's tourist board. And as local tennis hero, Andy Murray, prepares to marry his sweetheart Kim Sears in Dunblane on Saturday, interest in the country is at an all time high. The tennis star will wed Kim Sears in his hometown of Dunblane, north of Stirling, on April 11 . VisitScotland promotes country as the ideal wedding destination, in light of Andy Murray's upcoming nuptuals . In fact, last year, a quarter (24 per cent) of all marriages in Scotland involved couples from outside of the country. And the allure of the picturesque countryside and unusual Scottish wedding traditions has also had a serious economic impact on the region, with the wedding tourism industry bringing in £80 million last year alone. A recent survey has found that Scotland held 5.54 marriages per 1,000 - making it the most popular part of the UK in which to tie the knot. Southwest England was a close second however, boasting 5.40 per 1,000. The pair will tie the knot at the Dunblane Cathedral, a beautiful medieval church in central Scotland . However, the most popular wedding destination in the country is the council area of Dumfries and Galloway . Gretna Green, Dumfries and Galloway . The council area of Dumfries and Galloway, in the southwest of the country, was the most popular, thanks in large part to Gretna Green. The village, historically one of the first in Scotland, is famous for its runaway weddings, which began in 1754 during the time of Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act. Such popularity can be attributed in large part to Gretna Green, a town famous for its 'runaway weddings' Today, it remains one of the world's most popular wedding destinations, playing host to 5,000 weddings each year. And it's popular among Scots as well, with one in six opting to get hitched in the romantic locale. Argyll and Bute is the second most popular area for weddings in Scotland and is home to Barcaldine Castle . Argyll and Bute . Another popular wedding destination, Argyll and Bute is home to 11.21 marriages per 1,000 in Scotland. Not only is the area known for its stunning scenery, but it's also conveniently located less than two hours north of Glasgow. With plenty of stunning castles littering the countryside, couples are undoubtedly spoiled for choice when it comes to picking a venue, with Barcaldine Castle a popular option. On the coast of the Firth of Clyde, the Culzean Castle in South Ayrshire is a beloved wedding site . South Ayrshire . Slightly further north than Dumfries and Galloway, on the coast of the Firth of Clyde, is the beautiful South Ayrshire council. Rich in historical significance, the area is also known to be the birthplace of Robert Burns - and couples even have the option to get married at the Scot's birthplace museum. Other popular venues include the opulent Culzean Castle, the gorgeous crumbling ruins of the Dundonald Castle, and the sprawling grounds of the Enterkine House Hotel. A-listers have long favoured Scotland for the big day, with Jennifer Connelly marrying in East Lothian in 2003 . 1. Dumfries and Galloway . 2. Argyll and Bute . 3. South Ayrshire . 4. Perth and Kinross . 5. Highland . 6. Stirling . 7. Edinburgh . 8. East Lothian . 9. North Ayrshire . 10. Scottish Borders . According to a VisitScotland report, those who choose Scotland for their wedding usually fall into one of four groups: those with Scottish roots; those who want to get away from it all; those with a university or childhood connection to the area; and those inspired by the romance and celebrity appeal of Scotland, such as Andy Murray selecting the country for his high-profile affair. And the tennis star is keeping good celebrity company. Other A-listers who have opted to marry in Scotland include Madonna and Guy Ritchie, who wed at the Skibo Castle in 2000. Actress Jennifer Connelly married Paul Bettany at Gilmerton House in East Lothian, Scotland, in 2003. And daughter of Paul McCartney and fashion designer to the stars, Stella McCartney, opted to tie the knot at Mount Stuart in the summer of the same year. Fashion designer Stella McCartney wed at Mount Stuart on the Isle of Bute in Scotland in summer 2003 . Tourist weddings in Scotland tend to be a bit more expensive than those in other parts of the UK, although the average number of guests is generally smaller. Couples tend to stay in Scotland for six nights around their wedding date and make several weekend trips in advance of the big day to make arrangements. 'Put simply, Scotland is one of the most beautiful places in the world in which to get married,' explained Mike Cantlay, Chairman of VisitScotland. 'From the splendour and magnificence of our castles and historic homes, to the wild romantic nature of our lochs, mountains, islands and coastlines, there is a uniqueness and magic to having  your big day on Scottish soil.'","Scotland has been named the most popular wedding destination in the UK .

"ISIS militants besieging a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria's capital have savagely beheaded the leaders of a Hamas-linked group opposed to President Bashar Assad, it has been claimed. Having seized control of up to 90 per cent of the Yarmouk camp in south Damascus, the jihadis posted gruesome images showing the severed heads of two alleged members of Aknaf Beit al-Maqdis online. Like ISIS, the Palestinian group has declared Israel its sworn enemy, although its presence in Yarmouk has until now been to defend the camp's 18,000 residents from a crippling two year siege carried out by the Assad regime. ISIS' decision to publicly execute the men - as well as reports of the deaths of dozens more Palestinians during clashes inside Yarmouk - has prompted outrage in Gaza, where hundreds of furious Hamas supporters swore bloody revenge on the terror group during a march yesterday. Scroll down for video . Savages: ISIS militants (pictured) stormed the Yarmouk camp in south Damascus last Wednesday. 100 civilians were either killed or kidnapped by the jihadis in the subsequent days . Killers: Islamic State militants are seen storming the Yarmouk camp in Damascus last week . Hundreds of residents of the Yarmouk camp fled yesterday amid shelling by government forces and clashes between ISIS fighters and Palestinian militants, activists said. An activist based in an area just south of Damascus, Hatem al-Dimashqi, said many residents started fleeing the camp after midnight as the fighting let up. The camp has been subjected to intense shelling and airstrikes by government warplanes allegedly carrying barrel bombs. This morning activists said shelling and sporadic clashes are striking the Palestinian refugee camp in the Syrian capital, a situation a U.N. official describes as 'beyond inhumane.' Hatem al-Dimashqi, an activist based in an area just south of Damascus, said the Yarmouk camp witnessed sporadic clashes and shelling earlier today. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and al-Dimashqi said the refugees who have fled the camp have reached the southern Damascus suburbs of Yalda, Babila and Beit Sahem, which are under the control of anti-Assad rebels. Al-Dimashqi and Syrian state TV said as many as 2,000 people have left the camp. The activist said that many of those who fled the camp are staying in schools or abandoned homes. Roaming the streets: ISIS stormed the camp last Wednesday, marking the terrorist's deepest foray yet into Damascus - the Syrian capital and base of President Assad's government . Power: Palestinian officials and Syrian activists said ISIS have been working with rivals from the Al Qaeda affiliate in Syria, Nusra Front and have taken control of up to 90 per cent of Yarmouk . Chris Gunness, a spokesman for the U.N. agency that supports Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA, last night said that the agency has not been able to send any food nor any convoys into the camp since the current round of fighting started. 'That means that there is no food, there is no water and there is very little medicine,' he added. ISIS stormed the camp on Wednesday, marking the terrorist's deepest foray yet into Damascus - the Syrian capital and base of President Assad's government. Palestinian officials and Syrian activists said ISIS have been working with rivals from the Al Qaeda affiliate in Syria, Nusra Front. The two groups have fought bloody battles against each other in other parts of Syria, but appear to be cooperating in the attack on Yarmouk. The Nusra Front said in a statement yesterday that it is not participating in the battles and is taking a neutral stance. The statement added that Nusra opened its offices and welcomed all those who don't want to take part in the fighting and gave them refuge. Conflict zone: Hatem al-Dimashqi, an activist based in an area just south of Damascus, said the Yarmouk camp (pictured) witnessed sporadic clashes and shelling earlier today . The UN says around 18,000 civilians, including a large number of children, are trapped in Yarmouk (pictured) Speaking of Hamas-linked groups' clashes with ISIS in the camp, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that residents of Yarmouk have been victimized by Syria's civil war. Government forces and different rebel factions are clashing and 'we pay the price,' he said. He added that the Palestine Liberation Organization in Damascus has formed a 'cell to handle this tragedy and they are trying to work it out with the least losses.' Abbas said: 'We are in touch with our brothers there to find a way out and protect our people.' The Observatory said the fighting has killed 26 people since the clashes first broke out. In Gaza, several hundred supporters of the ruling Hamas group staged a march in the Jebaliya refugee camp late last night to protest ISIS' takeover of parts of Yarmouk. 'Palestinian blood is not cheap,' Mohammed Abu Askar, a local Hamas leader, told the crowd, threatening revenge for the Islamic State incursion into Yarmouk. In Damascus, Anwar Raja, the spokesman for Damsascus-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command, which supports embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad, said several pro-Assad factions have united to defend the camp. He said more than 100 civilians have been either killed or kidnapped by the ISIS fighters whom he said now control about half the camp, adding that the priority now is to evacuate civilians.

The UN says around 18,000 civilians, including a large number of children, are trapped in Yarmouk. The camp has been under government siege for nearly two years, leading to starvation and illnesses caused by lack of medical aid. The camp has also witnessed several rounds of ferocious and deadly fighting between government forces and militants. Most of the camp's estimated 160,000 inhabitants fled in late 2012 as clashes erupted between pro- and anti-Assad Palestinian gunmen. The majority of those who left fled to overcrowded and destitute Palestinian refugee camps in neighboring Lebanon. Only the poorest remained behind. Yesterday Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said six Lebanese truck drivers who were held by militants after they captured the Nasib border crossing point with Jordan have returned safely to Lebanon.

According to Jared McCarroll head chef at M Restaurant and Grill, the first step to a perfect steak starts when you are shopping; when buying steaks purchase the best meat you can afford. He told Femail: ‘It’s best to speak to your local butcher and pay a little bit extra and reap the rewards when eating it.’ And while we all stress about the cooking times for steak, he advises in checking the temperature of the meat before you start preparing your meal. 'One of the most important steps in cooking the perfect steak that is often forgotten or never thought about, is to allow your meat to come to room temperature first. 'This will shorten the cooking time and help to prevent grey rings from happening,' Mr McCarroll continued. Your steak should have a fine texture, be well marbled (veins of fat running through the meat) and firm to the touch. The shape and thickness of the steak is also important; the best steaks are one to 1.5-inches thick as a thinner cut is likely to get dry quicker. ‘The texture will depend on the quality of the beef and the cut; fillet has the best texture but the least flavour, whereas ribeye has more flavour and more fat, less texture but more flavour,' the chef said. ‘When it comes to the shape of the steak, try and keep it flat and a decent thickness. ‘Too thin a steak will be easy to overcook. Also try to keep the shape the same throughout the whole steak as this will help to keep the cooking consistent. A rib-eye (pictured) has more fat and more flavour but less texture . Some people like theirs blue while others don’t want to see any pink in their meat. But what are the perfect timings to cook steak the way you like it? If you are unsure, it's best to speak to your butcher as they will be able to give you the best advice based on the thickness and cut of meat. The cooking times below are for a 2cm thick sirloin steak . Blue: 1 minute each side. The steak should be just warm and fell spongy under your fingertips. Meat should still be dark in colour . Rare: 1.5 minutes per side. Dark red with some juice. There will be some resistance when you press the meat but it should still feel soft and bouncy . Medium rare:  2 minutes per side. Pink meat with pink juice. Springy, soft and spongy. Medium: 2.5  mins per side. Your meat will be mostly cooked with only pink in the middle. The steak will feel firm. Well-done: 4 to 5 minutes. There will be hardly any pink and the meat should have a bouncy, firm feel. But which cuts are the best? Or do they all have their own strengths? 'The cut depends on individual preference,' he said. 'The most important thing is to look out for marbling. Marbling is a great way to tell the quality of the meat. The more marbling a piece of steak has means the more moist it will be. Marbling means your steak is full of mono saturated fatty acid, proven to reduce cholesterol levels. It also has a low melting point, thus giving you the melt-in-the-mouth effect. When seasoning, Mr McCarroll advises using coarse salt. ‘When seasoning the beef, I would place the beef on the grill and season the top with a coarse salt; either rock salt or Maldon is good. ‘The steak will absorb the salt and when you flip it the excess salt will fall off, which means you can season the other side. Cook your steak on a grill and only flip it over once, he said. 'For me the best way to cook a steak is straight on the grill. Charcoal and wood will give you the most flavour and smokiness but if you have a gas BBQ that will do as well. 'Ideally you should only flip your steak once,' he continued. And while we’ve all been told various cooking times for the perfect steak, Mr McCarroll says there are too many variables to have anything set in stone. ‘Cooking times will vary depending on the size of the steak, whether it is room temperature, how hot your grill is. 'There are too many variables to give a specific cooking time,’ he said. The T-Bone (left) gets its name from the distinctive T-shaped bone. Filet mignons are prized for their tender meat although they are the least flavourful cuts . T-Bone: This cut gets its name from its distinctive T-shaped bone T-shaped bone. A succulent piece of meat which is both a strip sirloin (bone in) and a tender filet mignon. Also known as: Short loin, porterhouse, club steak . Filet mignon: A cut taken from the heart of the beef tenderloin. Known for it’s tenderness and texture but is not the most flavourful cut. Also known as tenderloin, tournedos, cheauteubriand, beef medallion . A New York Strip has good marbling and a strong flavour. Top Sirloin comes from the rump and is tougher . New York Strip: A cut taken from towards the rear-end of the steer from just behind the ribs, this has good marbling and strong beefy flavour. An excellent cut for grilling as it has less fat. Also known as: Strip Lon, Shell Steak, Kansas City Strip, New York Strip Steak . Top Sirloin: Sirloin meat is near the rump so this might take some chewing as its much tougher than meat taken from the loin or ribs. The top sirloin however is taken from the tender centre of the sirloin. Grilling it quickly will bring out its flavours best. New York Strip: A cut taken from towards the rear-end of the steer from just behind the ribs, this has good marbling and strong beefy flavour. An excellent cut for grilling as it has less fat. Also known as: Strip Loin, Shell Steak, Kansas City Strip, New York Strip Steak . The classic rib eye is a well-marbled piece of meat. The porterhouse is a combination of two cuts of steak . Rib eye: A classic cut, rib-eye steaks are usually well-marbled which make them one of the juiciest, melt-in-the-mouth steaks. Fat is what gives this steak its flavour . Also known as: Scotch fillet, Delmonico steak . Porterhouse: A combination of two cuts, the porterhouse is a very large steak comprised of A New York strip on one side and a tender filet on the other. Also known as: T-Bone, Short Loin.","Jared McCarroll head chef at M Restaurant and Grill shares his expertise .

"Given the choice between 'average' and 'beautiful', which description would you choose for yourself? That is the question that has been posed to women by Dove in a new survey, and the results are shocking. In Australia, 83 per cent of women rate themselves as average looking, the study found, while around the world just four per cent think they're worthy of the glowing epithet. Scroll down for video . What do you choose? Dove has asked women to rate themselves as either 'beautiful' or 'average' Low self esteem: 83 per cent of Australian women said they would describe themselves as average . Of the 9,397 out of 11,000 that answered 'average', 84 per cent regularly have negative thoughts about their appearance. While the statistics speak volumes about Australian women's perceptions of themselves, they appear more confident than the global average. A staggering 96 per cent of women around the world describe themselves as average, leaving just four per cent to admit they consider themselves beautiful. The beauty brand highlighted the survey results with a new video, released this week, that shows women being faced with the  choice of telling the world they see themselves as beautiful or average. Dove erected signs above doors to public buildings in five cities  - Shanghai, San Francisco, London, Sao Paulo and Delhi -  and filmed women's actions when faced with having to walk through one or the other. The vast majority of participants chose to walk through the 'average' door, corresponding closely with the survey results. On film: The statistics are highlighted in a new video by Dove which shows women having to walk through doors, either marked beautiful or average . Worldwide: The film was shot in five cities, Shanghai, San Francisco, London, Sao Paulo and Delhi . Dove says that  feeling beautiful is a personal choice that women should feel empowered to make for themselves every day. However, many found that when they had to behave in a way that revealed their image of themselves to the world - they balked. Many said afterwards that they regretted their decision, and that it had affected how they felt about themselves. One woman confessed: 'It was confronting to see these signs, and to have to choose, and be self -conscious of how you perceive yourself and if it lines up with how the rest of the world perceives you. Are you beautiful? The global statistic was higher, with a staggering 96 per cent of worldwide respondents answering 'average' Choices: Like the survey results, the overwhelming majority of women chose to walk through the doors marked 'average' Unnattainable: 'Beautiful, to me, is too far out of reach,' said one participant who chose the average door . Another said: 'It was my choice, and now I will question myself for the next few weeks, maybe months.' A British woman, laughing modestly, said: 'I went through the average door. I didn't even hesitate.' While a Brazilian participant, who chose 'average' admitted: 'I regretted my choice because it was different to what I live for and what I live.' A woman in India also said she wished she'd chosen differently, saying: 'I had rated myself as average and nobody else.' An American participant added: 'Am I choosing because of what is constantly bombarded at me and what I'm being told that I should accept? Or am I choosing because that's what I really believe?' In Shanghai, a  woman picked the average door, saying: 'Beautiful, to me, is too far out of reach.' The video is part of Dove's #ChooseBeautiful campaign, which aims to 'encourage women worldwide to reconsider the choices they make about their beauty and how those choices make them feel.' These women are confident about their looks, but many women who chose 'average'  said they regretted it . These schoolgirls take part in Dove's experiment and appear to be leaning towards the 'beautiful' door . Choose beautiful: The campaign aims to 'encourage women worldwide to reconsider the choices they make about their beauty and how those choices make them feel' The company's marketing director Jennifer Bremner said: 'Dove Choose Beautiful urges women to embrace this personal choice, because when we do, it unlocks happiness and confidence that impacts women's self-esteem. Women watching the campaign took to social media to express sadness that so many people felt the need to put themselves down. Jo Fiddy, from London, tweeted: 'Women we need to value ourselves more. 2 doors - Average & beautiful. Inspiring campaign.' Women took to Twitter to lament females' lack of confidence in their appearance around the world . Jo Fiddy from London exhorted women to value themselves more . Raya Was Here said that feeling beautiful is a decision every woman should make for herself . Samantha Blundell, from London, posted on Twitter: 'I decided to #choosebeautiful because if I don't think it myself, no one else will.' A user called @Raya_Was_Here, in Bulgaria, tweeted: 'Knowing that it's your decision to feel beautiful is so powerful. Once you realize that, no one can make you feel otherwise #ChooseBeautiful.' The latest video comes close on the heels of another ad created in France as part of its #SpeakBeautiful campaign. The clip was designed to highlight how many women put themselves down or fall prey to a critical inner voice. Skincare and beauty line Dove has long championed 'real' beauty, photographing everyday women rather than professional models for its advertisements. Dove asked a group of women in France - all beautiful and impeccably chic - to write down every thought they had about themselves in a notebook. The beauty brand then took the notes away with them and unbeknownst to the women, those criticisms, negative remarks and tirades of self body-shaming were turned into a script. Then two actresses, read the script out loud  as dialogue in a cafe, where the women themselves had been invited for coffee. In the experiment the women had to hear the actresses repeat their own thoughts to each other, out loud. One woman hears her  judgment on herself that her belly has the potential to look too big in the Dove ad . The comments were so cutting that a customer at a nearby table, who wasn't involved in the experiment, even intervened. An actress read out a remark written by one woman who appears very slim: 'Your arms are too big, your silhouette is all squashed.' She continues: 'Sit up straight otherwise your belly looks big.' Several of the women's messages to themselves echoed bullying, that if came from someone else, would be immediately frowned upon. 'With your little baby teeth you look like a mouse,' said one. While another read, 'your face looks like a bulldog.' When said out loud, the comments underline the way many women effectively bully themselves every single day. Visibly shocked by the comments, the women recognised the dialogue as their own notes. 'I hope my daughter never speaks to herself like that,' says one. While another concedes, 'yes that's what I say to myself all day long. Now, I get how violent it is!' The One Beautiful Thought campaign is  another of Dove's efforts to champion 'real' beauty.","New Dove worldwide survey finds 96 per cent think they're 'average'

"Customers at a Rio de Janeiro snack bar were unwittingly eating pastries made from the meat of stray dogs, police said today. Officers investigating the popular fast food house reportedly found boxes containing the frozen carcasses of dozens of dogs. The canines, which appeared to have been killed with blows to the head, were used for the fillings of 'pastels', a traditional Brazilian stuffed pastry which is deep-fried and normally made with ground beef. Officers investigating the Rio de Janeiro snack bar reportedly found boxes containing the frozen carcasses of dozens of dogs (pictured) According to police, owner Chinese Van Ruilonc admitted to making the snacks from dog meat, adding that the animals were strays he had rounded up from streets in the city, which will host next year's Olympic Games. Ruilonc, 32, is reportedly one of a group of Chinese businessmen who own dozens of pastry houses in Rio de Janeiro, including at least one in the beachside tourist district of Copacabana. The discovery at the eatery in Rio's northern district of Parada de Lucas was made after officers arrived to investigate claims trafficked Chinese workers were forced to live and work in slave-like conditions. The canines, which appeared to have been killed with blows to the head, were used as meat at  the fast food bar owned by Van Ruilonc . Police found a cage in the back of the establishment where workers were incarcerated, and made to work 18 hours a day without pay. Public prosecutor Guadalupe Louro Couto said officers were shocked at what they found. He said: 'I've seen lots of bad things, but what I saw in that pastry house was worse than everything. To start with, there was a cell, like a jail, with bars and padlock, set up inside the snack bar, where the worker was imprisoned. 'Apart from this, he lived with the stench of dead dogs, which were kept in the same room. I couldn't stand it. I started to feel ill and asked to leave. 'When we started to open the polystyrene boxes, we saw the frozen dogs. 'We were perplexed. There were various crimes being committed there.'

"A little boy has undergone more than 50 operations to have his entire face painstakingly rebuilt. Billy Mitchell, now seven, was born with Apert syndrome, a rare condition which left him with malformations of the skull, face, hands and feet. He endured a series of major operations to correct the deformities – which included a procedure to crack open and reshape his skull and another to rebuild his features. He also had a titanium frame drilled into his head, which was left there for nine weeks. Billy Mitchell, seven, was born with Apert syndrome, a rare genetic condition which causes malformations . The surgeries carried risks including meningitis, brain damage, catastrophic bleeding leading to stroke and potentially death, but Billy pulled through and now his parents say he absolutely loves his new face. Billy’s mother, Denise Mitchell, 47, said she knew immediately something was wrong with her son when he was born. ‘When I saw him I had an overwhelming sense of love. But he looked so ill and his skin appeared plastic and his head was misshapen,’ she said. ‘I also noticed his fingers and toes were sewn together.’ It was then a doctor broke the news he suspected Billy had Apert syndrome, a genetic abnormality where the bone plates in the skull fuse too early in the womb so the skull is unable to grow normally. The condition is caused by a chromosomal defect. Children with Apert have bulging eyes that are usually wide-set and tilted down at the sides. They may also have problems with tooth alignment due to jaw development problems, suffer from a cleft palate, and may have webbed fingers and toes. After his birth, doctors feared Billy would not last the night. The next day Mr and Mrs Mitchell, who live in Hertfordshire, were forced to have a heartbreaking conversation with doctors about turning off his life support machine. Specialists feared Billy's nose was totally blocked with misformed and premature fused bone, blocking his airway. Billy, pictured with his twin sister Lois, has undergone more than 50 operations to have his face rebuilt . But miraculously, Billy held  on, and in the morning he was transferred to a specialist children’s hospital where he had thin, metal tubes called stents inserted into his nose to help him breathe. He remained in a critical condition, surrounded by tubes and machines. Finally, when he was a month old, Mr and Mrs Mitchell were able to take him home to join his twin sister Lois and older sister Darcy, then five. But he often stopped breathing in the night, and at 10 weeks old Mrs Mitchell heard him crying. Apert syndrome is a genetic craniofacial abnormality that occurs in around one in 160,000 to 200,000 births. The condition is characterised by malformations of the skull, mid-face, hands and feet. The skull is prematurely fused and unable to grow normally. The mid-face - the area from the middle of the eye socket to the upper jaw - appears sunken. Some children with the condition have fused fingers and toes. Early surgery can relieve the pressure that builds up inside the fused skull as the brain grows. And operations can be carried out to re-model a child's face. She noticed that his left eyelid had been pulled behind his eyeball, causing his eye to pop out. After rushing to a doctor, he ended up having his lid sewn shut for a week. Children with Apert syndrome have very small eye orbits, meaning more of their eyeball is exposed. Billy's eye orbits were so shallow, especially the left, that his eye regularly popped out of its socket. Doctors advised Billy have his eyelid sewn together after he developed a corneal ulcer. Just six weeks later, he needed a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain, save his sight and reshape his whole head. Known as a ‘front orbital advancement’, surgeons opened his skull, detached it, remodelled his forehead and pieced it together again like a jigsaw. They also inserted two pins – each three inches long – into his head. For six months, the pins were turned twice a day to create more room inside his head to relieve pressure on his brain. Billy now needs 24-hour care, which has put a strain on family life. Mrs Mitchell said: ‘Luckily Paul and I had a strong relationship and we talked to each other about how we felt. ‘But Darcy was still young and had to grow up fast. When Billy was four months old he underwent a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain, save his sight and reshape his whole head . His fingers were also fused together leaving him struggling to clasp things properly. When he was 17 months old surgeons operated on him to separate Billy's fingers and toes down to the first knuckle . ‘And as for Lois, every time Billy was admitted to hospital, she’d look around wondering where he was. ‘But she was thriving, passing all the usual milestones. ‘It was also clear she had a special bond with Billy. Sometimes they’d snuggle up together. ‘When she learnt to sit up we propped Billy up with cushions and they’d spend ages playing together. And when Lois became mobile she’d fetch Billy his favourite toys.’ Billy’s fingers were fused together – known as ‘mitten hands’ – and so he struggled to clasp things properly. But when he was 17 months old a surgeon at Leeds General Hospital agreed to operate on them. During a nine hour operation, involving bone and skin grafts, he separated Billy’s fingers down to the first knuckle and did the same with his toes. In a second operation he finished the process, separating them fully. Mrs Mitchell said: ‘Billy had all four limbs in a cast for seven weeks but the results afterwards were amazing. ‘He grew in confidence overnight and a couple of weeks later learnt to sit up by himself. ‘Bright as a button he’d would watch Lois intently and began to copy her. As a family we were astounded by his progress. So too were the doctors.’ But the outside world was less understanding, and Mrs Mitchell said people would whisper whenever she took billy out in his pram. ‘Walking down the street one day I heard one woman say to her friend: ""God he looks awful"". Earlier this year Billy had another major operation which left him with a frame fitted to his face for nine weeks . ‘I was so upset I went straight home. ‘Another time when the twins were two and a half we were stood in the queue to see Santa when Darcy noticed some children pointing at Billy. ‘She told them not to do it because it was rude. Afterwards I overheard their mother saying: ""Well she shouldn’t bring him out should she."" ‘If only they knew what Billy was going through.’ But determined not to wrap their child in cotton wool, Mr and Mrs Mitchell sent Billy to nursery and he went to exactly the same school as his twin sister Lois. Despite his difficulties he has turned into a typical little boy, obsessed with cars, reading books, and enjoying playing fancy dress with his sister. Since his most recent surgery, Billy loves his new face, his mother Denise said . ‘He loved life and was determined to join in with everything,’ Mrs Mitchell says. In the summer of 2012 he underwent more major surgery. During a nine-hour operation surgeons took the left hand side of his skull off to remodel it and put it back with titanium springs to allow for more growth. His condition also left him with a distorted face and his eyes were becoming more and more exposed due to shallow eye sockets and breathing was a struggle. So earlier this year he also underwent high risk mid-face surgery, where his face was literally taken apart, reshaped and put back together again to create more room. His head was cut from ear to ear and his face cut vertically, with the skin being pulled down, exposing all of the bones of his face and jaw. His forehead, eye orbits, nose and top jaw were taken apart, reshaped and put back together with a red frame attached through a series of wires and bolts. The frame was left in place for nine weeks to encourage the bone to grow, as well as pull the existing facial bones forward. The bones were moved forward a millimeter a day by turning the screws on the frame, a process which allows new bone to grow and then to consolidate. Mrs Mitchell said: ‘So far he’s endured more than 50 general aesthetics and has been through so much. ‘But since his recent surgery he loves his news face. When he saw it for the first time without the frame I think he would have done cartwheels if he could. ‘It was a massive boost to his confidence. ‘And now, a few months on, he doesn’t even associate himself as having Apert syndrome. ‘But what’s incredible is the way he’s taken everything in his stride. We can’t thank all the doctors and nurses enough who’ve looked after him.

"'A family tragedy': Mahendra Bavishi in Khartoum . The joint director of the safe deposit company robbed in the £60million Hatton Garden gem heist said yesterday that he believes it was an inside job. Mahendra Bavishi, who lives in Sudan, said detectives have asked to put some ‘sensitive’ questions to his British-based son who runs the business, including whether he suspects someone connected to the company or other firms in the same premises had links with criminal gangs. And he said the robbers almost certainly had some inside information because they appeared to know that several CCTV cameras in the building where his firm is based were not working when they broke in. Speaking for the first time about the crime Mr Bavishi, 69, also told of his fury at police for ignoring an alert from a state of the art alarm in the vault while the gang were forcing their way into 72 safe deposit boxes during the Easter holiday. He described the robbery as a ‘tragedy’ for his family after the business had just started to make a small profit following years of losses. Mr Bavishi is a joint director of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd with eldest son Manish Bavishi, who lives in Kenton, north-west London, and usually runs the business full-time. But when the robbery happened Manish, 38, was on a month-long holiday with his wife and child in Sudan. In his absence, the business was being managed by younger brother Alok, 29. Their downcast father told the Daily Mail: ‘To many this robbery is like something out of a Hollywood fiction film, but to my family it is a tragedy. It is the end of the business my son has worked so hard to build slowly over the last seven years. ‘It was making a loss when he bought it and only first made a profit last year, and even then it was very little. Before then we were relying on loans from banks as we worked to make it a success. Now the business is finished. Who will trust their valuables with us after this?’ Scroll down for video . Caught on CCTV: One of the raiders. Mr Bavisihi said robbers almost certainly had some inside information . It is estimated that anything from £60million to £200million of jewellery and cash was removed from the company’s vaults in London’s diamond district. Mr Bavishi was in China on unrelated business when news broke about the robbery, but rushed back to Sudan to be with his eldest son who was himself frantically trying to arrange a return from Khartoum to the UK with his family, which took several days. He said: ‘The police called Manish on his phone in Sudan to tell him what happened and said we want you to come back to London because there are sensitive issues we want to talk to you about. ‘They told him they wanted to ask him questions that only he could answer about the business. The police want to know from Manish if he suspects someone inside who could have contact with a gang.’ Several retired detectives have already speculated that the gang must have had inside knowledge before sneaking into the block, abseiling down a lift shaft to the underground vault and drilling through a 7ft-thick concrete wall to reach the security boxes. The Hatton Garden Safe Deposit company is in a building which accommodates 60 other businesses. Mr Bavishi said: ‘There must be suspicion on everyone who worked in that building.’ It is estimated that anything from £60million to £200million of jewellery and cash was removed from the company’s vaults in London’s diamond district over the Easter weekend . The robbers set off an intruder alarm just after midnight on Good Friday and the Southern Monitoring Alarm Company contacted the Metropolitan Police’s Central Communications Command. Police recorded the call, but graded it so that ‘no police response was deemed to be required’. ‘It is incredible that the police did not act on this,’ said Mr Bavishi. ‘The police knew in advance that it would be closed over Easter so they must have realised nobody was meant to be in the vaults.’ Mr Bavishi, who was born in Sudan from Indian heritage, is a well-respected businessman in the North African country and a former president of the Khartoum Rotary Club. He runs the Manish Agency, which imports electrical goods to Sudan. Police are examining startling similarities between the Hatton Garden heist and a bank raid in Berlin two years ago. One line of inquiry is that a crew of specialist Eastern European thieves may have travelled to the UK for the raid at Easter. The operation was the mirror image of one on the vault of the Volksbank in Steglitz, south-west Berlin, in January 2013. Thieves made off with diamonds, gold and silver worth more than £8.3million from 294 safety deposit boxes after drilling through 80cm – around two and a half feet – of reinforced concrete. The gang spent weeks digging a tunnel from a rented parking space to reach the walls of the underground vault. They then drilled four massive holes in the wall after the bank closed on a Friday afternoon. The wooden boards used to construct the tunnel came from Poland, and bottles of Polish beer were left behind. In both the London and Berlin raids police suspect an insider passed on vital information that enabled the thieves to work out how to beat security systems. Police in Germany obtained DNA samples of some members of the gang, but they have never been traced. The Berlin bank is still negotiating with more than 100 deposit box owners who did not have theft insurance.","Mahendra Bavishi is joint director of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd .

"'Loneliness maps' are being used to tackle the problem of elderly people being left alone by working out which areas' residents are most at risk. Health experts have warned that being socially isolated can be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, leading to an increased risk of problems such as dementia and high blood pressure. Now campaigners say that local councils should draw up maps of the places where pensioners and others are most likely to suffer from social isolation. Map: This 'loneliness map' was drawn up by Essex County Council showing the areas where residents are most vulnerable to becoming socially isolated . Two county councils, Essex and Gloucestershire, have already implemented the maps, which allow them to target 'danger zones' of loneliness. A new report from the University of Kent and the Campaign to End Loneliness recommends the maps as a way of treating the problem across the country. In Gloucestershire, council bosses compiled the maps by studying statistics on a range of public health factors which are often linked to lonely people. They looked for areas with large numbers of over-65s, people living alone, people suffering from mental illness, households with no car and people on a low income. Danger: Being lonely can lead to health problems including dementia (picture posed by model) The council also surveyed residents to identify those who rarely speak to their neighbours, are unsatisfied with their social life and say they don't have someone to talk to. They then combined all those factors to map the districts where people are most likely to be suffering from loneliness, with the most vulnerable areas marked in red. A spokesman for the council said: 'Targeting local people who need our help the most is a priority for us in Gloucestershire and we are always looking at new ways to reach them. 'The map we've adapted from a model by Essex County Council means that we can work out how many people could be lonely and where those people need us most.' The Campaign to End Loneliness has now called on other councils to copy the maps and draw up their own versions for their local area. The campaign's director Laura Alcock-Ferguson said: 'Finding people who are experiencing loneliness can be challenging, as they are often also some of the most hidden people in our communities. 'However, it is encouraging that, across the country, there are excellent examples of councils that are employing different strategies to identify residents most at risk of loneliness. 'If local councils and services do not act now to find the people experiencing severe loneliness, we are likely to see the consequences in our hospitals and social care services.' The report identifies a number of other risk factors that might make people more likely to suffer from chronic loneliness. People from ethnic minorities, those recently bereaved or forced to care for their loved ones and childless pensioners are particularly susceptible.","Local councils are urged to draw up maps of the residents who are at risk .

"The federal government has pledged to scrap the religious exemption from welfare benefits in an attempt to crackdown on parents who choose not to vaccinate their children. Under the tough new 'no jab, no pay' laws, Social Services Minister Scott Morrison has announced on Sunday that parents will no longer be able to access childcare benefits simply by signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on 'personal, philosophical or religious' reasons. Parents who refuse to immunised their children are set to lose up to $15,000 a year for every child when the changes come into force from January 1, 2016. Meanwhile, families who do vaccinate their kids are eligible for the $7,500-a-year childcare rebate, $200-a-week childcare benefit and the $726 Family Tax Benefit Part A end of year supplement. Scroll down for video . The government has announced they will strip parents of welfare benefits if they don't immunise their kids . The 'conscientious objector' exemption on children's vaccination has been effective since the Howard Government, but after meeting with religious organisations, Mr Morrison said payments will be cut off if parents don't immunise their kids. 'We have had discussions with the Church of Christ, Scientist and have formed the view that this exemption is no longer current or necessary and will therefore be removed,' Minister Morrison said. 'Having been informed the religion is not advising members to avoid vaccinating their children and following engagement with members, the government no longer sees that the exemption is current and the authorisation for this exemption has been withdrawn. 'Having resolved this outstanding matter the government will not be receiving nor authorising any further vaccination exemption applications from religious organisations. 'The only authorised exemption from being required to have children immunised in order to receive benefits is on medical grounds. 'While parents have the right to decide to not vaccinate their children, if they are doing so as a vaccination objector, they are no longer eligible for assistance from the Australian Government.' Minister for Social Services Scott Morrison has announced the end to religious exemption on children’s vaccinations for access to childcare benefits . Parents who refuse to immunised their children are set to lose up to $15,000 a year for every child . The announcement comes after Mr Morrison said while immunising children against deadly diseases protects the wider society, it should be a prerequisite to receive tax payer money. 'We've got to think about the health and well-being of all the other children that are put at risk, and it's their health that also matters,' he said. 'And in fact, you know, those parents have taken decisions to immunise their children, and that's obviously the sensible thing to do. We're a free country, and we're for free society, but that doesn't mean you get to take taxpayers' money if you don't want to go along with the rules.' While doctors and pro-vaccination groups are tipped to welcome the reforms as a way to increase the number of children being vaccinated, some immunisation experts are worried the move won't bolster immunisation rates. Currently around 39,000 children under the age of seven are not vaccinated. Currently around 39,000 Australian children under the age of seven are not vaccinated putting them at risk of catching severe diseases .","The government will scrap the religious exemption from welfare benefits .

"Animal abuse: Former animal shelter worker Catherine Lynn Smith, 50 (pictured), was arrested Tuesday after the bodies of 10 cats and three dogs were found decaying in her home, which had been auctioned off . Police came across a sickening scene in Macon, Georgia this week when they searched the home of a former animal shelter worker. Christine Lynn Smith was arrested on Tuesday after the bodies of 10 dogs and three cats were found decomposing in her former home littered with over 1,000 empty beer cans. The 50-year-old's home on North Pine Knoll Drive was recently auctioned off, and new homeowner Ed Harrell was checking out the property in the afternoon when he found a dead dog just inside the doorway and called police. Deputies had to completely air out the home, which stenched of ammonia, before proceeding inside to find the decaying bodies of nine more dogs and three cats - most in crates. 'A foul odor came from the home and I observed multiple beer boxes and empty beer cans (best estimate approximately 1,000),' Deputy Paul Schoenbeck described in his incident report. 'The odor and ammonia fumes in the home caused me to have to leave the residence to catch my breath and regain balance as I was becoming light headed,' he added. Officials with Macon-Bibb Animal Welfare estimate that the animals had been dead for months. The animals' bodies were apparently so decayed that it was impossible to conduct a necropsy to see how they died. It was also revealed that  the 50-year-old had worked at the shelter for two months in 2012, but had been fired within her six-month probationary period for reasons not disclosed. Smith claimed she quit the job, according to a man who knew Smith from the local bar scene and spoke with WGXA. Robert Wilson says he was surprised to hear about her arrest. Scroll down for video . House of horror: Above, Smith's former home in Macon, Georgia. Despite the fact that it had been auctioned off to a new owner, Smith continued to live at the house. Police had to air out the home Tuesday due to the stench of ammonia . Locked up: Smith was arrested a Macon bar and appeared in court for the first time on Wednesday, where she was arraigned on 13 counts of animal cruelty. Many of the animals found dead in her home were still in cages . 'What I think happened is, she used to take in a lot of strays from what she told me and she was also having financial difficulties for a while and probably still was, and she was just trying to do the best she could but unfortunately it just turned out that way,' Wilson said. The center's assistant interim director said that none of the animals found in Smith's home were taken from the animal center. Neighbor William Hopkins was outside the house when police started removing the bodies. 'They were carrying out cages containing what look like, old dried out leather,' Hopkins told 41 NBC. 'Then the stench hit me and it's like yep, they're dead all of them. Smith appears to have still been living in the home since one of the rooms was cleaner than the rest. A witness also told police that she had seen Smith at the house two days prior. The witness 'stated that she knew she was an animal lover and that she worked with rescues,' according to the incident report. Police located Smith Tuesday evening at a bar in Macon, 20's Pub and Subs, and charged her with 13 counts of animal cruelty. Smith appeared in court for the first time on Wednesday, when she was ordered held on $74,000 bond, not to take any more animals into her care or carry any weapons. When the judge asked Smith if she understood she can't adopt any more pets, she said: 'I don't have any.' Smith's bond was lowered to $15,600 later that afternoon and she posted bail that evening.","Catherine Smith, 50, was arrested Tuesday at a bar in Macon, Georgia .

"A Dartmouth College judicial committee has 'derecognized' a fraternity that partly inspired the 1978 cult classic 'Animal House' because some new members received brands on their backsides. It found Alpha Delta responsible for causing harm to pledges and violating terms of a suspension for alcohol violations. The fraternity has until next Monday to appeal the decision. Alpha Delta President Ryan Maguire said members are disappointed and exploring options. Booted out: A Dartmouth College judicial committee has 'derecognized' Alpha Delta after several pledges received brands on their backsides . Regardless of the outcome of an appeal, Inge-Lise Ameer, interim dean, has the authority to withdraw recognition of Alpha Delta. She's taken evidence from the committee under advisement. Attorney George Ostler said last month Alpha Delta acknowledged a small group of members voluntarily chose to get brands on their backsides, but said the practice - which he compared to a form of self-expression akin to piercing and tattoos - was never a condition of membership and has since stopped. A sophomore pledge of Alpha Delta reportedly agreed to be branded on his backside in the fall of 2014, according to a whistleblower. By agreeing to the branding, the pledge would theoretically be allowed to avoid 'more drinking-intensive pledge activities'. When the pledge went home for winter break, he realized something was wrong with his brand and went to the doctor, Gawker first reported last month. Toga! The 46-year-old Greek organization partly inspired the 1978 National Lampoon's Animal House starring John Belushi (pictured center) He had to be hospitalized after it was determined the brand was infected. Medical personnel alerted the college, which is in Hanover, New Hampshire, and the school handed down a suspension. This is not the first time Alpha Delta has been linked to branding. Making changes: Dartmouth College President Philip Hanlon - who was a member of Alpha Delta in the 1970s - announced this year a series of reforms to eliminate problems he said were 'hijacking' Dartmouth's future . A 1992 Rolling Stone article reported that 'a few pledges were reportedly branded against their will this year'. Alpha Delta brothers did not deny that allegation at the time. The pledge whose brand became infected is now a brother in the fraternity. The Greek organization has received bad publicity over the past four years. In 2011, two students were hurt when they plummeted from the roof of the Alpha Delta house, reported Valley News. Two years later, the notorious frat was indicted for serving alcohol to minors. That same year, Alpha Delta was force to issue an apology for organizing a 'Bloods and Crips' themed party. Then in October 2014, Alpha Delta was suspended for committing alcohol violations. Earlier this year, Dartmouth College President Philip Hanlon - who was a member of Alpha Delta in the 1970s - announced a series of reforms to eliminate problems he said were 'hijacking' Dartmouth's future that included high-risk drinking, sexual assault and a lack of inclusiveness on campus. The college is banning hard liquor on campus, ending pledge or probationary periods for all student groups to reduce hazing, developing a mandatory sexual violence prevention program and creating new residential communities. Alpha Delta was initially founded by members of the Gamma Sigma Society but dissociated from its parent corporation and renamed itself The Alpha Delta Fraternity in 1969.","College judicial committee found Alpha Delta responsible for causing harm to pledges and violating terms of suspension for alcohol violations .

"Bio security measures are being stepped up at Brisbane International Airport after mosquitoes that could potentially infect Australians with debilitating diseases were found on three separate occasions. Planes coming from South-East Asian countries are being routinely fumigated before luggage is removed after finding the exotic mosquito Aedes aegypti, which is responsible for an annual outbreak of dengue in North Queensland. The mozzie is known to carry crippling viruses like dengue, chikunguya and yellow fever. Aedes aegypti, known for its black and white stripes, can spread crippling diseases like dengue and chikunguya . The blood suckers, who are known for their black and white stripped legs, were discovered in the international baggage terminal on February 17, March 30 and again on March 31. Federal Minister for Agricultural Barnaby Joyce said there will be other measures to control the flying critters alongside fumigation, which include knockdown fogging, surface spraying, and treatment of standing water. Authorities said if the troublesome mosquitoes hadn't been detected they could have become a serious threat to the health of those living around the airport. Mr Joyce noted that tests were being carried out to narrow down exactly where the exotic insect came from. The blood suckers were discovered in the international terminal baggage on February 17, March 30 and again on March 31 . “This will allow us to better target our efforts to make sure none of these mosquitoes enter and establish in Australia—which could have a devastating impact on our human and animal health.' In February, authorities were forced to step up bio security at Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane airports after exotic mosquitoes were found in cargo holds. “There have been no further detections in Perth, Adelaide or Melbourne since the new measures were rolled out. This is a good result and it shows the flexibility of our risk-based bio security system—when risk increases so does our level of intervention,” Minister Joyce said. Exotic mosquitoes are a serious health concern for authorities because they are the primary transmitter of diseases like dengue. In February authorities were forced to step up bio security at Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane airports after exotic mosquitoes were found in cargo holds. Dengue fever can cause severe flu-like illnesses such as a fever, headaches, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, swollen glands or a rash. The virus is transmitted to humans when an infected female gives you a bite. The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that before 1970, only 9 countries had experienced severe dengue epidemics. Currently, the disease is prolific in more than 100 countries including Africa, the Americas, South-east Asia and the Western Pacific. While vaccinations are being developed there is no surefire way to stop people contracting the disease if mozzies in the area have been infected. Dengue fever can cause severe flu-like illnesses such as a fever, headaches, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, swollen glands or a rash. Chikunguya can also cause a terrible rash, swelling, muscle pain, headache, fatigue, nausea or vomiting . While dengue isn’t generally deadly WHO said it can cause deadly complications like fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding or organ impairment, which present with symptoms such as severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing and bleeding gums. Sixty-seven people in Queensland’s southeast contracted dengue fever this year however all cases were contracted while overseas.

"An art collector today claimed she was robbed of more than £4million worth of jewellery during a designer handbag snatch in a notorious motorway tunnel in Paris. The German woman, who has not been named, was in a taxi which was stuck in traffic shortly after arriving at Charles de Gaulle airport on Wednesday afternoon. Three thieves are said to have ‘appeared from nowhere’ and smashed a rear window of the car, making off with the bag. The heist took place in the Landy Tunnel (pictured), which is just under a mile long and notorious for smash-and-grabs . It included numerous valuable items including a single ring worth close to £1million, as well as around 12 other valuable pieces. Today the victim told police that all of the items, which also included watches, bracelets, and rings were worth well over £4million. The ‘extremely rich’ German, who is part Taiwanese, was on her way to loan some of the jewels to the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris, according to sources close to the case. But, in a mysterious twist, the museum later denied knowing anything about the intended delivery. Detectives were today trying to work out whether the thieves had inside knowledge, or had simply ‘got lucky’, said an investigating source. The German woman, who has not been named, was in a taxi which was stuck in traffic shortly after arriving at Charles de Gaulle airport (pictured) Rather than escaping on a motorbike – which is usual – the thieves in this case ran away on foot, scrambling up a sharp motorway embankment. The items are all listed and numbered because of their high value – something which will make them very hard to sell on. The heist took place in the Landy Tunnel, which is just under a mile long and notorious for smash-and-grabs. Youths living in local housing estates often follow passengers on mopeds, and then attack the cars they are travelling in.

'That was the beginning of a beautiful love story - one that lasted over 70 years. They never looked back. They both knew they were meant for each other.' After marrying before the end of the war the couple settled in Broughton near Chester to raise their 'adored' family . They went on to have two children, Jennifer and Mark, with Mr Pearson taking up work with British Aerospace in Broughton. After welcoming five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, the couple remained in their home until October, when they both moved to Countess of Chester Hospital, Cheshire. Mrs Pearson died on March 13, her husband following just two days later. At the service at Blacon Crematorium, family members paid tribute to the 'inseparable' couple. Great granddaughter Amy Griffiths read a personal tribute recalling a kaleidoscope of memories, including caravan holidays, football and cricket on the beach and 'always a polo mint in Grandad's pocket'. 'Never been apart - together for ever and always in life and afterlife,' she wrote. 'The greatest true love story.' Concluding the service, Mrs McDonald said: 'They left their earthly lives together. 'They could not be separated.' They were buried in a joint funeral this week where mourners heard how theirs was the 'greatest true love story'","Ronald Pearson and his wife Miriam met and were married during WWII .

"Ed Miliband today refused to guarantee that Harriet Harman would become Deputy Prime Minister if Labour wins the general election. Just hours before the party launched its women's manifesto, the Labour leader declined several chances to say that his deputy would get the second most powerful job if he gets to Number 10. The snub comes just three days after Miss Harman made clear that she intended to take the role were Labour to make it back into power. Ed Miliband today refused to confirm that deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman would become Deputy Prime Minister if Labour wins the general election . Miss Harman has previously suggested that Gordon Brown's refusal in 2007 to maker her Deputy PM was sexist. Today Mr Miliband also refused to guarantee her the role. He told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: 'Well she's the shadow deputy Prime Minister at the moment. 'I've made a sort of self-denying ordinance which is that I don't do what I call measuring the curtains, which is starting to presume the result of the election on May 7th. 'Harriet is an incredibly strong, incredible asset to our party, I can't say fairer than that, but I'm not going to start anticipating what might happen after the election.' His remarks will infuriate Miss Harman, who told the BBC's Andrew Marr show on Sunday that she intended to become Deputy Prime Minister. 'Well I'm Shadow Deputy Prime Minister and I hope that we'll get into government,' she said. Last year Miss Harman used a speech to criticise Mr Brown for not making her Deputy PM when she was elected Labour's deputy leader. 'Imagine my surprise when having won a hard-fought election to succeed John Prescott as deputy leader of the Labour Party, I discovered that I was not to succeed him as deputy prime minister,' she said. 'If one of the men had won the deputy leadership would that have happened? Would they have put up with it? I doubt it.' While refusing to guarantee the job to Miss Harman, Mr Miliband has given stronger assurance to shadow Chancellor Ed Balls that he will have the top job at the Treasury, however. Last month he said: 'I'll tell you who is going to be writing a Labour Budget – it's me and Ed Balls, not Alex Salmond in a million years.' Miss Harman is touring the UK in a pink bus which is meant to showcase 'women's issues' but has been derided for being patronising to female voters . Mr Miliband also defended Miss Harman's 'pink bus', saying he 'loved it' but had not yet been on board. The pink bus – which is meant to showcase 'women's issues' - has been derided for being patronising to female voters. But Mr Miliband defended it, saying at least it 'provoked' a conversation. 'I love the pink bus, I am aspiring to go on it.' He also hit out at suggestions that his wife Justine Thornton had fallen into the 'trap' of being an accessory on the campaign trail, insisting she cared deeply about the country. 'I'd like to see anyone try and stop Justine taking part in this campaign because she'd tell them what for….She is not part of the padding, she is her own person.' Mr Miliband added that she was a 'very successful environmental lawyer' who has recently had her 'biggest case which was about defending Columbian farmers from the might of BP'. Asked about his complicated former love life – including a tryst with former Newsnight economics editor Stephanie Flanders - being played out in the press, Mr Miliband insisted it did not bother him. 'The people I feel sorry for are the people who I have been out with in the past because I am a public figure and they are not.' The Labour leader also admitted his main 'frustration' with his job was not being able to spend enough time with his sons, Daniel, 5 and Samuel, 4. Mr Miliband admitted that he would be hit by his planned Mansion Tax on his £2million north London home . Presenter Jenni Murray told Mr Miliband when she looked at his young sons, she thought of the pressures that had befallen Euan Blair. Mr Miliband admitted: 'It's hard this, I know my first responsibility is to be their dad and I take that incredibly seriously. If I have one frustration about this job, it's making the time for them. I don't want to be an absent father but I am definitely not going to let that happen.' One of Labour's own policies would end up costing his family more, Mr Miliband admitted. He said his own north London townhouse: 'I think I'll be in the £2m to £3m band which is £250 a month. But that is a difference at this election: I believe that people who are well-off, people in my position, should pay a little bit more for the NHS; David Cameron wants to cut taxes further for those who are better off like himself.' Mr Miliband also insisted that he and his older brother were 'moving on' from the Labour contest, in which Ed Miliband was the surprise victor. Asked why, as his critics said, he had 'stabbed' his brother David in the front to go for the Labour leadership, Mr Miliband said: 'What drove me to it is a sense that the Labour Party needed to move on from New Labour. I had strong and deep beliefs about how the country needed to change.' He denied his mother had been too troubled by it, saying 'My mum is pretty stoical. She has faced much harder things to deal with in her life.' Mr Miliband also pledged to try and scrap the 'ridiculous' tampon tax. Currently, sanitary products attract VAT of 5 per cent. He said: 'We reduced it to 5 per cent, I'd like to go further. I can't promise I will go further because there are these rules in place, but I will keep trying, because it seems to me a ridiculous that you have VAT at all on this,' he said.","Labour leader declines several times to say that his deputy would get job .

"Pensioners are being offered mortgages that will only be paid off when they are 105. Nationwide Building Society is giving anyone up to the age of 70 the chance to take out a 35-year loan – stoking fears of a buy-to-let boom. The offer comes as pension reforms give over-55s access to billions of pounds from today to withdraw from their pension pots and spend as they like. Tens of thousands of savers are being tempted to put their money into property – and this surge of ‘silver landlords’ is likely to push up house prices. Nationwide Building Society is giving anyone up to the age of 70 the chance to take out a 35-year loan, meaning some pensioners are being offered mortgages that will only be paid off when they are 105 (file picture, posed) Traditionally, banks have been reluctant to allow borrowing beyond retirement, but now other lenders are considering raising their age limits too. Savers who want to put their money towards buy-to-let properties are unlikely to be able to afford to purchase a house outright, with the average price standing at £273,000. The option of taking out a mortgage to cover the shortfall has previously been unavailable as banks prefer people to repay before turning 70 or 75. But unlike residential mortgages, funded by income likely to fall away in retirement, a buy-to-let mortgage is funded by rental income, which does not cease when the owner retires. Economists say the increase in silver landlords competing to buy properties is boosting house prices, which are increasing at 8.4 per cent a year. Three in four of Britain’s 2million landlords regard their property as their pension, according to research from financial consultancy BDRC. About one in five homes in Britain are owned by private landlords, and this is expected to rise to one in three by 2032, Government figures suggest. But there are perils too. The buy-to-let boom expected to follow today’s changes could have painful tax consequences for some, experts warn. Withdrawing large sums from a pension pot will trigger a hefty income tax bill – for example, taking out £150,000 will produce a £40,000 demand from HMRC. Buy-to-let homes also attract tax on rental income and capital gains tax if the property is later sold. And for ageing landlords, there is inheritance tax to consider too. Tens of thousands of savers who have had their pension released under today's new reforms are being tempted to put their money into property – and this surge of ‘silver landlords’ is likely to push up house prices . Jane Vass of Age UK said: ‘Although Age UK believes affordability not age should determine whether someone is given a loan, using your pension fund to pay the deposit could have significant tax and financial consequences and if there is a downturn in the rental market you could find your own financial security is jeopardised.’ Nationwide decided soon after the pension reforms were announced in 2014 that it would consider applicants aged up to 70 for a 35-year loan. The firm said it had recognised that buy-to-let was becoming a more popular source of retirement income as reports suggest half a million savers could plough pension pots into buy-to-let properties after the reforms take effect today. Experts have also warned of the difficulty of taking on a landlords’ responsibilities. Financial strategist Penny O’Nions said: ‘A lot of people will buy houses with their pension funds with no idea of the repercussions. ‘There may be excellent advantages but the downsides are that many of them will not appreciate that the management of a property can be harsh. When you are aged 104, do you really want to be managing a property? ‘Difficult tenants feigning problems with the property, periods when the property is empty, council tenants not paying – there is a long list. People should not go into it without good advice.’ If a person with a mortgage that lasts until they are 105 dies before paying off the loan, the usual rules apply: their estate, or whoever inherits the property, would either take on the debt or the house would be sold to pay off the mortgage. However, it is cheaper for young people to obtain life cover to pay off the mortgage if they die early.","Pensioners are being offered mortgages that will be paid off at age of 105 .

"A university undergraduate has claimed that the cost of trying to study in London left her with no other choice than to turn to prostitution. As renting in the capital soared to an average of more than £1,100 per month, the second year history and politics student who attends a London university told how she took up sex work– even visiting some clients at their workplace. Speaking through the English Collective of Prostitutes', the woman – who asked to remain anonymous – spoke after a research project revealed more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry. A University student has revealed how she turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover her rent (picture posed by model) The survey conducted by the University of Swansea further revealed that nearly five per cent of them had actually worked in the sex industry. The young woman said that she didn't immediately turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after conventional means of work failed to support her. She said: 'I started working after my first year and tried various part time jobs: in a coffee shop, a pub and as a waitress. None paid enough. 'The student loan didn't cover even my housing, let alone living expenses, food, books and travel costs.' She added that money worries meant she began to struggle academically as well as financially. 'I had trouble keeping up with course work, especially if I worked evenings. 'For example at the pub, I'd earn £7 an hour for an eight hour shift, two nights a week, so I'd bring home about £100 weekly. 'I'd just moved to London from the north of England. My family are not well off, so cannot afford to help me much. The student says that traditional means of earning failed to cover the cost of living in London . 'I didn't know anyone in London so when I moved here it was starting from scratch.' Initially she lived in student accommodation in the city but says that working as a prostitute enabled her to afford somewhere better. 'It was an overcrowded, noisy flat with other students,' she said of her halls. She moved into her own home after she began to advertise her services. 'I could afford a place of my own. I advertise through a website and have regular clients. 'I visit them at home, in hotels and occasionally at their workplace.' Despite sex work not being an ideal situation the student says that it had been beneficial towards her studies. 'It is flexible and fits around my course. 'I can work the hours I want to and scale back around exam time or if I have extra course work.' The woman heard about sex work from other students who had also been looking for a way to earn extra money. 'In my first year at university I started hearing about students turning to sex work,' she said. 'After a time I met someone on another course who'd been working as a stripper in a bar. 'Through her I met another student doing escorting, she clued me in, said where to advertise, and how to avoid bad clients and work safely. 'She gave me the English Collective of Prostitutes' Rights sheet which tells about the laws and how they work. Although her new means of earning have enabled her to continue studying in London the woman says she does not particularly enjoy her work. 'My biggest worry is about being arrested because if I get a criminal record it would stay with me for life. It would be massive obstacle to getting other jobs.' However she remains adamant that this is the best option for her after seeing other friends trying alternative routes. 'Sex work is far batter paid and suits my time more than any other work I know of. 'Friends at university are working 10 hour shifts for under the minimum wage. Others are working on zero hour contracts and never know how many hours they will get. 'Sometimes they get none at all so it is very hard to budget and pay bills. 'I know students who've dropped out and left courses due to financial pressures.' However she is well aware of the risks she is taking and says she takes appropriate precautions to avoid being found out. 'Mostly students doing sex work don't talk about it. If it comes out, it could affect your future and job prospects.' The student's story may seem like a rare case but she says that it is become more regular practice in universities: 'Since I started escorting I've heard that a former roommate exchanged sex with her landlord to cover the rent. 'Another woman I know worked as a part time sex worker to earn enough to travel home to visit her family. 'Sex work among students is much more common than people think, and it is likely to increase as long as fees, rent and the cost of living is so high.'","A student has revealed she turned to sex work to cover the cost of living and studying in London .

"An elderly couple died of carbon monoxide poisoning after lighting a barbecue in their home to keep warm during a power cut, an inquest heard. Grandparents Patrick and Marianne Charles, 78 and 74, were without heating during a blackout on a cold November night last year. The couple, who had been married for 53 years, sat down in their conservatory in Eastbourne, East Sussex, with a glass of wine each and fired up the barbecue to heat up the room. An elderly couple died of carbon monoxide poisoning after lighting a barbecue in their home (pictured) to keep warm during a power cut, an inquest heard . The conservatory quickly filled with smoke and within minutes the couple were unconscious after choking on the fumes. They couple laid dead for 16 days before their son, Andrew Charles, raised the alarm on December 11 and police searched the property, Hastings Magistrates' Court heard. Maintenance work by UK Power Networks caused the power cut, the inquest was told. Mr Charles said his parents often went on holiday abroad and neighbours said the pair 'kept themselves to themselves', so it was not unusual for them to go weeks without contact. The son's statement to the hearing read: 'They loved their holidays, faithful friends and their grandchildren. They were happy and in love after 53 years of marriage.' East Sussex deputy coroner Christopher Wilkinson recorded a conclusion of accidental death. They couple laid dead at their home on Cedar Close, Eastbourne, for 16 days before their son found them . Carbon monoxide poisoning is often caused by people lighting barbecues inside tents, with campers warned not to use them in enclosed spaces. Official advice from Public Health England on carbon monoxide poisoning states: 'The potentially deadly gas, which you can’t taste, smell or see, is produced when fossil fuels or wood burn without enough oxygen. 'Several campsite deaths have been linked to carbon monoxide poisoning from barbecues in recent years. The gas can build up quickly to potentially fatal levels in enclosed spaces such as tents or caravans.' Sheila Merril, public health adviser at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: 'Carbon monoxide (CO) is particularly dangerous because it has no colour, smell or taste. It is therefore easy to inhale without realising it. 'CO poisoning is caused by faulty or badly-serviced gas and other fossil fuel-burning appliances and systems. Barbecues should not be used indoors as this can lead to a build up of CO. 'To remain safe, families need to ensure that gas and fossil fuel appliances are serviced regularly and know the signs of CO poisoning, which include prolonged flu-like symptoms or coal or wood fires that burn slowly or go out.' Symptoms can include headaches, drowsiness and nausea, causing some victims to believe they have a minor illness, such as a cold or food poisioning, or are even just sleepy. However long exposure to the toxic fumes can have severe consequences, including unconsciousness and death.","Patrick and Marianne Charles lit the barbecue as their heating was cut off .

"At 6-foot-5 and 289lb JJ Watt is a terror on the football field - recording more than 20 sacks and forcing four fumbles for the Houston Texans with his explosive speed and power last season. Now the NFL defensive end flaunting his incredible athletic process off the field. On Monday he released a video that shows him making an incredible 61-inch vertical leap. The standing box jump - a popular CrossFit workout move - is billed as a personal best. JJ Watt performed an incredible 61-inch box standing box jump. An impressive feat for a man who weighs nearly 300 pounds . The Houston Texans defensive tackle released the video as part of his announcement that he has signed an endorsement deal with Reebok . Watt, already a legend in Houston for his performance both on the field and off, leaned down after his jump and declared: 'Must have been the shoes, baby!' The clip, impressive as it may be, appears to be a stunt for Reebok, which announced on Monday that they had signed the NFL star to a shoe endorsement deal. After completing the jump, Watt, 26, screams and declares: 'It must have been the shoes, baby!' The video was posted to YouTube by Reebok and pushed the lime-green $110 ZPump Fusion shoes that Watt wears for the stunt. Watt, who has been building a superhuman reputation both with his on-the-field heroics and off-the-field community work, will be the face of the company's 'Be More Human' ad campaign. Don't mess with Texans: Watt, 6-foot-5 and 290lbs, has made a reputation for himself as a defensive terror on the football field . 'The ability to have input in the products I will be wearing is what I love, letting them know what I think they can help me with,' he told the Houston Chronicle. A survey of YouTube reveals only one higher standing box jump - 64 inches recorded by a personal trainer in Wisconsin. However, none of them are nearly as enormous as Watt, who managed to leap more than five feet in the air despite weighing nearly 300 pounds. At the end of the season, Watt signed a six-year, $100million contract with the Texans that included a $10million signing bonus. The terms of his deal with Reebok were not disclosed. He had previously signed an endorsement deal with Nike.","The Houston Texans defensive end released the video as part of his announcement of signing a Reebok endorsement deal .

"Nigel Farage was booed by the audience of last night's live television debate after complaining of a ‘total lack of comprehension’ from those in attendance. The Ukip leader risked alienating those watching at Westminster's Central Hall in London as he protested they were ‘a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC’. His outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching. Scroll down for video . Booed: Ukip leader Nigel Farage risked alienating those watching at Westminster's Central Hall in London as he protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC' Explanation: Mr Farage was heckled before David Dimbleby (pictured), who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say how the audience had been chosen . He said: ‘There just seems to be a total lack of comprehension on this panel, and indeed amongst this audience, which is a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC.’ Mr Farage was heckled by members of the audience before David Dimbleby, who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say: ‘Nigel, let me just say one thing. ‘This is an audience that has been carefully chosen not by the BBC, but by an independent polling organisation to represent the balance between all parties.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband gave the Ukip leader the advice: ‘It's never a great idea to attack the audience, Nigel, in my opinion.’ But Mr Farage retorted: ‘The real audience are sitting at home.'

Left alone: Mr Farage (right) stands alone while the other four leaders go up to each other following the debate . Which political leader won the latest TV debate? Which political leader won the latest TV debate? Now share your opinion . Mr Farage said: 'A rapid rise in population due to open door immigration... has directly contributed to the housing crisis. 'If you have net migration running at 300,000 a year, that's 300,000 people who need somewhere to live.' Miss Sturgeon won loud applause as she urged Mr Farage to 'put the bogeyman to one side'. She told him: 'We have a housing crisis across this country. You know what, Nigel Farage? It isn't caused by immigrants. In your world every problem is caused by immigrants.' The BBC insisted the audience had been chosen by an independent polling organisation to reflect the supporters of all parties - not just those represented by their leaders last night. A spokesman for the corporation told MailOnline yesterday: 'ICM recruited an audience to give a cross section of political opinion.' ICM, a public opinion research company founded in 1989, was unavailable for comment last night. Ukip meanwhile was said to be pressing for an inquiry into how the audience was chosen. Asked after the debate about Mr Farage's criticism of the audience, Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: 'I am not sure whether we will complain. All I will say is I didn't think the audience was representative of the views of British people. 'I think Nigel Farage would have done very well with people sitting at home.' Mr Nuttall said he had spoken about things which had happened to him on Question Time, telling reporters: 'Who knows, may be some people are being disingenuous on their application forms.' At the debate: (From left) Labour Party leader Ed Miiband, Plaid Cymru Party leader Leanne Wood, Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon and Mr Farage . Unimpressed: Ukip voter Mike Cripps, 44 . A Ukip voter has insisted he is having second thoughts about backing the party after Nigel Farage attacked the studio audience. Security worker Mike Cripps, 44, of Bromley, south-east London, believed the Ukip leader had ‘done a couple of stupid things’. The first was his comment on the audience and the second was raising his views on people with HIV visiting the UK for NHS treatment, Mr Cripps said. Asked if Mr Farage's remarks had put him off supporting Ukip, Mr Cripps said: ‘It did a bit, yeah. I don't think he put himself across right. ‘If we're just talking about the debate tonight - it's what we should be talking about, not what he's done six years ago or two years ago or yesterday - for me, Nicola Sturgeon was the best. ‘She was slick, she was well prepared, she had been well briefed, that's my personal opinion. Ed Miliband - it was like he was reading off a script.’ Asked if adopting an attack on the audience was an easy get out clause for dismissing opposition to Ukip's views, he added: 'Oh no. People at home agree with us and that's what really matters - the millions of people at home watching this. 'We know, for example, on immigration, on the European Union they agree with where Ukip stands. What the audience in here really think is, I suppose, irrelevant.' Tweeting during the debate, Lord Ashcroft said: 'A minority view once again. Nigel Farage having a go at the BBC audience may well appeal to the viewers whose vote he is targeting.' And Sky News presenter Kay Burley tweeted: 'Farage having a pop at balance of audience. Dodgy ground there. Broadcasters jump through hoops to make sure studio is fair.' Also speaking at the debate - three weeks before the General Election - were Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, Green leader Natalie Bennett and Nicola Sturgeon from the Scottish National Party. Miss Sturgeon later mocked Mr Farage's attempt to 'win friends and influence people'. Five questions were asked by the audience during the BBC ‘challengers’ debate, with each of the five leaders also making a short opening and closing statement. The first clash of the evening came between Mr Miliband and Mr Farage with the Labour leader saying that Ukip's sums for clearing the deficit ‘don't add up’. But Mr Farage said: ‘Our sums do add up. You obviously haven't read the manifesto.' As the end credits rolled following the BBC debate last night, four of the five party leaders shook hands with each other - but Mr Farage just drank from a glass of water from behind his stand. As Miss Bennett and Miss Wood walked away, Miss Sturgeon then went to shake Mr Farage's hand - and Mr Miliband offered the Ukip leader a pat on the back. Then, all of the leaders went to the audience to shake their hands - with the exception, again, of Mr Farage. He shook hands with Mr Dimbleby before leaving without going up to the audience.

"A burlesque performer is attempting to eradicate all negativity surrounding the word 'fat' – by embracing it as an honest, body-positive description of her own physique. During a recent TED talk, Lillian Bustle, from New Jersey, revealed that she also calls herself 'short', because she is 5'3'', and 'wife', because she is married, noting that each of these words is just an honest description of what she is. And 'fat' is just another self-descriptor for her, who insists that the word doesn't have to be used as a synonym for 'ugly'. 'We as women are programmed to tell each other that we're not fat, because to many people - both men and women - fat is the worst thing that you can be,' she said during her talk, which took place earlier this month. Scroll down for video . Not-so-tiny dancer: Burlesque performer Lillian Bustle explained in her TED talk that 'fat' is just another word - and using it doesn't have to be an insult . Beauty comes in bigger packages, too: During her lecture, Lillian explained that 'fat' shouldn't mean the same thing as ugly . Unfortunately, Lillian added, her worldview isn't held by everyone, and she pointed to a statistic that shows that size discrimination in the workplace has risen 66 per cent in the past 30 years. And those negative perceptions of bigger people start young: The top 'magic wish' for girls 11 to 17, according to a study, is to be thinner. But there's hope. Lillian explained that, according to other studies, 'the more we're exposed to body diversity, the more we tolerate, accept, and yes, even prefer, different body types'. That promising fact is something that encourages the dancer to perform burlesque, which enables her to expose her audiences to a 'fat' body in a positive, glamorous way. Changing minds: Studies show that the more people are exposed to different body types, the more they like them; Lillian hopes exposing her audience to a fuller figure will change their perceptions . Lillian also quoted another performer named Beelzebabe, who has spoken out in the past about the fact that the body diversity of burlesque performers 'challenges us to rethink the narrow confines that society has given us for what's desirable'. It certainly challenged Lillian, who weighs in at 240lbs. She admits she was in awe at the first burlesque show she ever saw, immediately resolving to try it herself. She began performing in 2012, and says the experience has been both empowering and incredibly body-positive. While the first time she performed she was nervous about people seeing her arms jiggle, once she did it, she felt like she could 'walk through fire'. Now, whenever she's feeling insecure, she can think back to that first performance; Lillian recommends other people find a similar 'courage reference' - a moment you felt brave that you can think back to at times when you feel more insecure and afraid. Self-esteem boost: Lillian said she was nervous before her first performance because of how her arms looked, but now she feels great about her body . Plump crowd-pleaser: While a few people have left nasty comments on the YouTube page for her TED talk, Lillian said the response has been mostly positive . Though Lillian gave her TED talk in 2014, it was only posted on YouTube three weeks ago. Since then, the clip has generated nearly 38,000 views - and plenty of positive feedback. 'I’ve never been so happy in all my life,' she wrote for xoJane. 'I’ve had this stupid grin on my face for a week straight.' Besides a few 'trolls' posting vicious negative comments, Lillian received a slew of positive messages, including letters of thanks, personal stories, and an email from a teenage girl who watched the video with her younger sister and said it made them reevaluate the way they viewed their bodies. 'I really think we - and by ""we"" I mean nice people and body-positivity - are winning,' she said.","At 240lbs, Lillian Bustle says she's not being negative when she calls herself 'fat' - she is just being factual .
She says she likes performing burlesque because it helps open people up to liking different body types .

"A legal stoush looms between Perth Glory and Football Federation Australia after the A-League club was booted out of the finals for cheating the salary cap. Glory were fined $269,000 and relegated to seventh spot on the table after being found guilty of rorting the salary cap over the previous three years. As the club suffered a 3 - 0 defeat to Sydney on Friday night, fans set off a series of flares, unimpressed by attempts by officials to placate them. Perth were found to have exceeded the cap by around $400,000 this season alone, with FFA claiming the club failed to disclose payments and benefits to at least six players. FFA chief executive David Gallop said he expects Perth's management to be removed in the wake of the mess. Perth Glory will be excluded from the A-League finals after breaching the salary cap over three seasons . Chief Executive Jason Brewer speaking at a press conference at the Perth Glory Head Office on Friday . But Glory revealed on Friday night that they have filed with the Supreme Court of Western Australia seeking an injunction against FFA's verdict. If that falls flat, Glory will go through the FFA's appeals process in a bid to either overturn the decision, or reduce the penalty. 'This season, our player payments, paid under the salary cap, are forecast to be below that salary cap threshold of $2.55 million,' Glory chief executive Jason Brewer said. 'All the payments this club makes - to its coaches, players, administrative staff - are all made through the club's accounts here. '(They are) made by our finance department, recorded in our ledger, and those amounts are all audited at the end of the year by an independent auditor. 'We go into the next games on the basis that for all Perth Glory fans out there, our players are playing for points.' FFA chief executive David Gallop said he expects Perth's management to be removed in the wake of the mess . December 17: Fairfax publishes a report claiming it has seen documents showing Perth Glory may have exceeded the salary cap for up to three seasons. It claims Glory failed to disclose numerous benefits it paid to players and their agents. February 12: FFA issues Glory with show-cause notice alleging the club failed to disclose numerous benefits to players over a three-year period. Perth Glory chief executive Jason Brewer claims the club will still be well under the salary cap even if these other costs are included. February 16: FFA staff head to Perth's offices to conduct a salary cap audit. April 1: FFA issues Glory with second show-cause notice relating to alleged serious breaches. FFA claims Glory failed to disclose reportable payments and significantly exceeded the salary cap. April 8: Glory responds to second show-cause notice, but only after being granted a two-hour extension of their deadline. April 10: FFA hands down the heaviest penalties in A-League history after finding Glory deliberately and consistently cheated the salary cap. Glory announces appeal process has started. Gallop earlier claimed Perth deliberately hid salary cap rorting for three seasons and deserved to be banned from this season's finals. 'The breach this season involves the deliberate failure to disclose payments and benefits to at least six players,' Gallop said. 'Where you've got deliberate concealment, you need to impose strict penalties to send a deterrent. 'Certainly it would be clear that the management have engaged in these practices and, in our view, it would be unlikely that management would stay in place.' Glory face a $269,000 fine and relegated to seventh spot  after being found guilty of rorting the salary cap . Glory were sitting equal first at the time of the punishment, but they will now finish the season in seventh spot unless they successfully appeal. Should the original punishment stand, Brisbane Roar are likely to sneak into the finals. The FFA said in addition to the deliberate salary cap breaches, Perth also broke rules regarding the disclosure of payments in the 2012/13 and 2013/14 seasons. The peak governing body said Perth were guilty of three breaches, including payments outside of a standard player contract; payments to a player's family member; payments of travel costs; provision of motor vehicles; and accommodation benefits.","Perth Glory will be excluded from the  finals after breaching the salary cap .

"Small, brown and infinitely snackable, the almond seems so inoffensive. And yet just as this latest health food is supposed to be transforming our lives, battling high cholesterol and heart attacks, it is having a ruinous effect on the planet. The nut that frequently appears in the Bible as a symbol of fruitfulness and promise has been dubbed ‘the Devil’s nut’, pinpointed as the chief culprit in an eco-disaster that is developing in California. The so-called Golden State is increasingly turning a dirty brown colour due to a devastating drought that is in its fourth year. Although it’s tempting to blame all those irresponsible Californians filling their huge swimming pools and watering their lawns with abandon, domestic water consumption is dwarfed by that of agriculture. Bone dry: A Californian farmer is pictured surveying his drought-hit land in San Luis Obispo County . The state has long been one of the world’s biggest producers of fruit and vegetables — for profit-hungry farmers, its year-round sunshine more than outweighs the obvious drawback that it hardly ever rains there. Californian farmers have been allowed to hog dwindling supplies of water, digging ever-deeper bore holes to keep the rest of us stocked up with all-year-round peaches, sweet peppers and pistachios. And all would still have been fine if it hadn’t been for the addition of almonds. The trouble is, global demand for the nut is soaring — as customers from David Cameron to millions of middle-class Chinese develop a passion for almond-based foods. The Prime Minister is said to splash almond milk on his breakfast cereal and in his tea. And it almost certainly comes from California. Attracted by the huge profits being made from a crop that is hardly cheap, California farmers now satisfy 84 per cent of the world’s almond demand. Worth £3.8 billion in 2013, almonds have become California’s second biggest agricultural commodity after milk, as demand has exploded by 1,000 per cent in a decade. The problem is that almonds guzzle water on a monumental scale. It has been calculated that it takes 1.1 gallons of water to grow a single almond. Worse, they need water all the year round, so almond trees must be watered even when they are not producing. Dry days: Homes with swimming pools are seen in the Palm Springs area, California, as the state enters its fourth year of severe drought . Since almond trees cover almost a million acres of California (about the size of Cornwall) — many of them on previously virgin hillsides or in areas with little or no rain — that’s a lot of H2O being sucked up to satisfy our almond craving. In total, almonds are annually consuming 1.07 trillion gallons of water in the state — a fifth more than the entire indoor water usage of all 39 million Californians. All of which is slightly problematic, given that two-thirds of California is classified as being in ‘extreme drought’, as the region suffers its driest conditions for 1,200 years. U.S. government weather experts are talking about a mega-drought that could last for decades. The state’s governor, Jerry Brown, last month ordered cities and towns to slash their water consumption by at least a quarter and by as much as 35 per cent in some urban areas. Residents have been told to take shorter showers and to stop watering their lawns. Owners of swimming pools — the icon of the California lifestyle — are being banned from filling them in some neighbourhoods. But the governor’s decision to exempt farms from his draconian measure has infuriated voters, who quickly identified who was really to blame. One TV station has talked about ‘almond shaming’, while the Los Angeles Times outed them as the ‘villains’ of the super-drought. Some almond farmers have tried to shift the blame. ‘The tomato growers use a lot more water than we do,’ says one, Ryon Paton, but no one believes him. Almonds are high in potassium, calcium, vitamin E and magnesium, and are thought to reduce cholesterol and decrease hunger without leading to weight gain . The hunt is on for celebrity almond investors, amid reports that both Oprah Winfrey and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice are making huge sums from almond farms. Almond farmers are also fighting among themselves. Smaller growers are blaming the big companies moving into the market, saying they are growing almonds in areas that are too dry for the trees. Because farmers have to irrigate almond trees continuously, they are using groundwater — the underground water that feeds aquifers and theoretically provides the state’s emergency reserves. Groundwater supplies have been shrinking for decades, but the mega-rich, big almond growers can afford to sink bore holes more than 100ft to find the precious liquid. So is the state of California, birthplace of Sixties’ hippy values, rushing to root up almond groves and rescue its corner of the planet? Quite the opposite. In America, dollar signs are everything. A recent government survey found that 77 per cent of California almond farmers plan to plant more trees. They have the support of the state’s leaders who get vast sums in taxes from such a high-value crop. Paul Wenger, head of the California Farm Bureau, says any talk of curbing almond growing ‘gets to be kind of un-American. It’s a free country and they have the right to do what they want’. Unlike cows' milk, almond milk – which is made from ground nuts and water – has no cholesterol or lactose, and being a plant food, it is often consumed by vegans, vegetarians, and others forgoing dairy . California has been bingeing on water for decades, building homes in arid areas that shouldn’t be inhabited — as their owners discover when they are engulfed in bushfires. Farming is governed by the same ‘who cares’ attitude. America has vast amounts of rich agricultural land in god-forsaken states like Iowa, but California has a Mediterranean climate that’s ideal for high-profit crops like almonds. If Californians won’t save themselves, an obvious solution is for everyone else to stop buying their almonds. But weaning ourselves off something hailed a ‘miracle food’ could be tough. The average American snacks on 2lb of almonds a year. Britain is catching up fast. UK almond milk sales are soaring at a rate of 70-80 per cent a year as shoppers opt for a dairy-free alternative that they believe is healthier for your heart and the perfect solution to the growing prevalence of lactose intolerance. Last year, Sainsbury’s reported its sales were up by 181 per cent year-on-year. A study in the British Medical Journal even challenged the ‘benefit’ of dairy milk, saying it not only fails to prevent bone fractures but may double the risk of early death. For almond milk producers there could be no better sales pitch. But do the PM and his trendy friends know it takes 23 gallons of water to produce a glass of almond milk? The Prime Minister is said to splash almond milk on his breakfast cereal and in his tea. And it almost certainly comes from California . Nutrition experts see the almond as meeting an increasing demand for a natural, low-calorie and high-protein food that tastes more pleasant than that old health shop stalwart, soya. It’s more versatile, too — almond butter can be spread on toast like peanut butter, ground into flour and nibbled as a snack. Nuts may have a reputation as being fattening but almond fans say they are packed with antioxidants and healthy fats that help modulate blood sugar and reduce hunger. The list of reputed benefits goes on and on. Perhaps it is not surprising, given that almonds are mentioned in the Book of Genesis as ‘among the best of fruits’. The rod of Aaron — brother of Moses — supposedly brought forth fragrant almond flowers. But if there’s a smell in the air in California, it is the stench of greed — as America’s most self-indulgent state pours away its fast-vanishing water to feed a global obsession with a humble nut.","Global demand soaring as people develop passion for almond-based foods .

"A hilarious manufacturing mistake means some police officers will have the word 'POLICE' written upside down on their uniforms. The error was spotted during a Hampshire Constabulary training course in Hamble near Southampton. Two officers have decided to proudly continue wearing the tops with the mistake on the left sleeve to 'boost morale' within the force. Error: A hilarious manufacturing mistake means some police officers will have the word 'POLICE' written upside down on their uniforms (pictured) Three tops in total were sent to the force but one member of staff decided to return the faulty garment.

John Apter said: 'I saw an officer wearing the uniform during a training day at the Hampshire Constabulary headquarters. 'I initially thought the uniform was inside out. I then spoke to an another officer who said he was given one which was exactly the same. 'It was an error by the manufacturing company but it is funny that some of the officers have to decided to wear them. 'It boosts morale within the force because it's funny to see. Three officers were given them and I heard one of them sent it back to the manufacturing firm. Who knows, they could be worth some money in the future.' Mr Apter said the officers will only wear the uniforms 'internally' and not when they are patrolling the area. He added: 'It makes people simile and I'm sure the uniforms will inject a bit of morale into the police force. Although it is an unfortunate error, hopefully people can see the funny side of it.'

"The Turin Shroud, one of Christianity's most celebrated and hotly-debated relics, went on display to the public on Sunday for the first time in five years. More than one million people have already booked their slots to see the piece of linen that devotees believe to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ between now and June 24. 'Whether you believe or don't believe, there is no doubt it is something special,' said an Italian man who was among the first visitors following the opening mass in the Italian city of Turin. Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia presents the Holy Shroud, which will be on public display until June 24, 2015 . Pilgrims have already made reservations to see the cloth, believed to have been used to wrap Jesus' body . Imprinted with the image of a man who appears to have been crucified, the shroud has been dated to the end of the 13th century, lending support to those who say it is a medieval forgery. But it has retained its mystical air for many thanks partly to the fact that researchers have been unable to establish exactly how the image was created. The Church does not officially maintain that Christ's body was wrapped in the shroud or that any miracles were involved in the creation of the image now on display. But it does value the relic's symbolic value as a powerful representation of Christ's suffering. 'It is not a profession of faith because it is not an object of faith, nor of devotion, but it can help faith,' Turin Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia said earlier this week. Local authorities are counting on the exhibition of the shroud in the city's cathedral to give a significant boost to the local economy at a time of stagnation across Italy. Guards stand by the Turin Shroud as it went back on display for the first time in five years in Turin's cathedral . The 14 foot-long linen has the faded image of a boarded man and has been a source of wonder for centuries . When the shroud was last presented to the public, in 2010, more than two million people filed past it. Pope Francis decreed the latest exhibition to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of St John Bosco, a 19th century monk who devoted his life to the education of poor children in newly-industrialised Turin. Francis, who has family roots in the region, is due to visit the city and the exhibition on June 20-21. The shroud will be on display for 12 hours a day between 7.30am and 7.30pm with an entry free but requiring reservation via the website www.sindone.org or a special call centre. Viewers will be afforded only a few minutes each in front of the original although they will be able to linger longer at a specially-made model and a related exhibition.","Pilgrims flock to see relic which is believed to have wrapped Jesus' body .

"Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's relieved Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been found guilty of carrying out the Boston bombing - the greatest tragedy in her state's recent history - but doesn't believe he should be executed. In an interview with CBS This Morning on Thursday, Warren reacted to Wednesday's jury verdict which found the 21-year-old guilty on all 30 charges related to the Boston Marathon explosions which killed three and injured hundreds at the finish line. 'Nothing is ever going to make those who were injured whole and it's been a terrible thing but this is a step toward justice,' Warren said. When asked what she would like to see happen in the penalty stage of the trial, liberal-minded Warren stuck by her anti-death penalty stance. 'My heart goes out to the families here but I don't support the death penalty. I think that he should spend his life in jail - no possibility of parole - he should die in prison. But that's just how I see it. It's up to the jury,' she said. Scroll down for video . Life in prison: Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Thursday that she doesn't believe convicted Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death. Warren pictured left on CBS This Morning on Thursday. Tsarnaev pictured right in Boston federal court on Wednesday as his guilty verdict was read . Warren went on to speak about current Democratic party issues, as well as comment and likely presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. However, the woman once thought to be a front-runner for her party refused to compare her politics to the former secretary of state. Warren has repeatedly denied that she will run in the Democratic primaries. Now that Tsarnaev has been found guilty of committing the Boston Marathon bombings, the case will move on to the penalty stage of the trail which could begin as early as Monday. It is in this stage of the trial that the jury will decide whether or not to sentence Tsarnaev to life in prison or the death penalty - a matter in which they will have to vote unanimously. Justice: Boston Marathon bombing survivor Karen Brassard, second from left, speaks alongside Carlos Arredondo, left, Laurie Scher, second from right, and Mike Ward, on Wednesday following the conviction of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev . While the defense rarely cross-examined witnesses in the first portion of the trial, they will be more active in the next stage as they attempt to convince the jury against sentencing Tsarnaev to death. One thing Tsarnaev's favor is his lead defense attorney Judy Clarke, who specializes in death penalty cases and spared notorious killers like Unabomber Ted Kaczynski from execution. Clarke's method is to humanize her client to the jury, with stories about their life which might explain what led them to commit such heinous crimes. In the first portion of the trial, the defense alluded to an argument that then 19-year-old Tsarnaev was influenced by his radicalized older brother Tamerlan. Attorneys will likely continue that storyline with this next phase of the trial, exploring the brothers relationship, their childhood in Soviet Russia and Kyrgzstan and their later immigration to the U.S. with their parents. However, legal experts say saving Tsarnaev from the death penalty will be her toughest job yet. Secret weapon: Tsarnaev's lead defense attorney, Judy Clarke, specializes in death penalty cases and has spared several of her notorious killer clients from execution by humanizing them to the jury. Pictured above leaving court on Wednesday, after hearing the guilty verdict for Tsarnaev . 'I haven't yet heard all the mitigating factors you'd expect to hear. In traditional death penalty cases, it's physical abuse, sexual abuse, drug abuse, dropping out of school,' Meg Penrose, a death penalty expert at Texas A&M University School of Law, said. However, Tsarnaev has yet another advantage of being put on trial in Massachusetts since the state outlawed capital punishment in 1984. While the death penalty is not allowed in state cases, Tsarnaev is being tried in federal court which makes the death penalty a possible sentencing option. However, experts say that since the jury was pulled from a pool of Massachusetts residents, they could decided against the death penalty as a reflection of the state's general politics on the issue. The prosecution will also have to convince the jury while Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death, proving that the crime was carried out with certain aggravating factors that warrant execution. So far they've listed such factors as killing a child and planning the attack for the day of the Marathon to maximize the loss of life.","Tsarnaev, 21, was found guilty Wednesday on all 30 charges related to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing .

"A diner who couldn't afford to pay for her pork roast at a pub restaurant secretly plucked a young girl's hair and put it in her food to try and get it for free. Louise Smith, 38, has been convicted of fraud and is now on the run after CCTV footage showed her standing over the girl, aged under 10, and pulling two hairs from her head. She was eating dinner with the child and a man in the Crown and Thistle pub near Carlisle, Cumbria, last May when she planted the hairs and complained to staff. But Carlisle Magistrates' Court heard this week that in reality Smith did not have enough money to pay for the £21 dinner. Louise Smith, 38, secretly plucked a young girl's hair and put it in her food at the Crown and Thistle pub near Carlisle, Cumbria . Smith, from Eastriggs, near Annan, denied fraud in February but failed to attend her trial this week so she was convicted in her absence. Prosecutor Peter Kelly told the court that Smith had some drinks at the pub and then ordered a meal. She  moved to three different tables in the bar area and the man asked several questions about the menu and the soup, the court heard. He was given a small sample to try which Smith then ordered. The 38-year-old then approached a member of staff  with a half-eaten meal and said she had found a hair in the food. Carlisle Magistrates' Court heard this week that Smith did not have enough money to pay for the £21 dinner . But when baffled staff probed their CCTV, they found her standing over the small girl and plucking two hairs from her head. Chef Stephen Foster said that once he was made aware of the alleged hair in the food he had to investigate under Health and Safety rules. He told the court that none of his staff had hair like the one found. The court was told Smith was asked if the other meals were okay and she said they were. A refund was offered for the one meal which she refused. It was at this point that it became clear that she did not have enough money to pay the £21 bill. Stephen and Jill Foster, the licensees of the Crown & Thistle, said: 'In the first instance it is important to stress that we take food hygiene extremely seriously and it is for this reason we investigated the hair in the food incident under Health & Safety rules. 'It also came to our attention that this was not a straight forward matter and that as well as being a fraudulent act, the welfare of a child was a concern, something our own CCTV coverage corroborated. 'For this reason the incident was referred to the police which then became a child protection matter and was thereafter pursued through the courts, resulting in a conviction. 'At all times our primary concern was for the welfare of the child and also the health and safety of our customers. 'We pride ourselves on offering excellent quality food to our customers and we are thankful to them for their ongoing loyalty and support.' An arrest warrant, without bail, has now been issued and Cumbria Police has asked Smith to hand herself in. She will be sentenced at a later date.","Louise Smith, 38, has been convicted of fraud and is now on the run .

"Salads in British supermarkets are being grown by workers treated like ‘slaves’ who live in filthy conditions, an investigation has found. Migrant workers producing vegetables exported to Britain say they are denied basic hygiene facilities while working and are forced to use bushes near where the vegetables are being grown as toilets. They are not provided with soap or water to wash their hands, while some live in filthy shacks made of wood and plastic sheeting near the fields in southern Spain. They claim they are treated like slaves by agencies who hire them to produce the salads and vegetables that end up on supermarket shelves in Britain, the investigation by Channel 4 News found. They also say they are made to work around dangerous pesticides – causing some to fall ill – and are routinely left unpaid for hours they have worked. The revelations will horrify millions of customers of British supermarkets, all of which tell consumers their food is produced ethically and that workers are treated fairly. And they will lead to claims that the bitter price war which has seen supermarkets slash prices in a bid to compete with discounters Aldi and Lidl has led to ruthless exploitation of the vulnerable. A firm that supplies salad and vegetables to Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Asda is among those accused of using mistreated workersSome workers say they have developed horrific sinus conditions and bronchitis as a result of being sprayed with the pesticides while producing the vegetables in the fields of Murcia. Cleaning: Some live in filthy shacks made of wood and plastic sheeting near the fields in Almeria southern Spain . Yesterday British politicians demanded an urgent investigation, saying the evidence was ‘appalling’ and appeared to show ‘effectively slave labour producing food in 2015’. Sainsbury’s and Waitrose said they would investigate immediately. All the major British supermarkets claim they source food responsibly. And they have all signed up to tough rules to promote workers’ rights under the global Ethical Trading Initiative, designed to protect labourers. The revelations centre on workers in Murcia and Almeria from where millions of pounds worth of vegetables are exported to the UK every year. Workers in one field in Murcia were filmed being sprayed with pesticides. One vegetable picker working for a firm in Almeria supplying courgettes to the UK told of the filthy conditions in which he was made to work. ‘For the toilet you have to go in the bushes,’ he said. ‘What is there to clean yourself? For these courgettes to reach England, there are workers who have suffered a lot.’ Growing trade: The workers say they have to work around dangerous pesticides - causing some to fall ill . He said workers at his company, based in Almeria, were also sprayed with pesticides but were too afraid to complain because their names would be put on a blacklist known as ‘the list of rotten sardines’. Lettuce: The revelations will lead to claims that the bitter supermarket price war has led to ruthless exploitation of the vulnerable . The investigation also uncovered concerns about workers for Agroherni, a Murcia firm which sells £22million worth of salad, herbs and vegetables a year to Britain’s major supermarkets including Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Marks and Spencer. It is not alleged that Agroherni's workers are forced to live  in dirty conditions or work without sanitation, but one former employee told how she had been left in agonising pain and needed multiple operations on her sinuses after working in fields where pesticides were being sprayed. The woman, who did not want to be named, said: ‘All that matters to them is fulfilling their clients’ orders.’ Agroherni uses an employment agency called Integra Empleo to provide workers to pick the produce in its fields, but the workers say the agency routinely denies them pay. One lettuce picker said: ‘If we work 26 days, they write down 16 or 18. They always steal seven or eight days.’ Last night Tory Richard Drax, a former member of the Environment and Rural Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘If true, these allegations are appalling. It sounds like effectively slave labour producing food in 2015 which is utterly unacceptable. ‘Supermarkets must explain themselves. It is up to them to know who is producing their food and in what conditions.’ Tory Neil Parish, a colleague on the committee, said: ‘There is always a price to pay for cheap imported food; whether it is poor quality, low animal welfare standards or, in this case, the appalling treatment of workers.’ More than 40 employment agencies supply labour to farm growers in the Murcia region. All the top supermarkets say they abide by the Ethical Trading Initiative. Tesco says it has local ethical trade managers on the ground who investigate claims locally. Bagged up: The revelations will horrify millions of customers of British supermarkets (file picture) But it is thought the companies who are major suppliers to the supermarkets get round the rules by using employment agencies who cut corners to save money. Both Agroherni and Integra Empleo deny all the allegations and say they have launched investigations into the claims. Probe: Sainsbury’s (pictured) and Waitrose said they would investigate the findings immediately . Agroherni said it maintains a strict procedure with regard to the use of pesticides and is not aware of any relevant incidents. It strongly denied that it mistreats or exploits agency workers and said the fair treatment and safety of workers was paramount. However as a result of the Channel 4 News investigation it has ceased working with Integra Empleo and is to employ the workers directly. A Sainsbury’s spokesman said: ‘We expect our suppliers to adhere to the highest quality and welfare standards, regardless of where they operate in the world. We are taking these allegations very seriously and will be conducting our own investigation.’ A Waitrose spokesman said: ‘Worker welfare is very important to us – our supplier is investigating these allegations and will ensure that our high standards are being met.’ A spokesman for the British Retail Consortium which represents all the supermarkets said: ‘Ensuring workers are treated fairly in our supply chains is a key concern for retailers. We know all supermarkets will examine these allegations closely.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Vegetables sold in UK are grown by workers 'denied basic hygiene facilities' in Almeria, Spain .

"Authorities say a second boy has died after his family's car plunged into Los Angeles harbor, killing his 13-year-old brother. The family had left a waterfront restaurant Thursday night when their sedan ran off the road alongside a working dock at the Port of Los Angeles, landing upside down in about 30 feet of water. The boy's parents swam to the surface, but the children were stuck in vehicle. They weren't breathing when rescuers brought them up. The teen died at the hospital several hours later. Coroner investigator Joseph Cronin tells City News Service that the eight-year-old boy died Friday afternoon. Scroll down for video .

The car traveled some distance before lurching into the harbor, where it landed upside down in about 30 feet of water just off of Berth 73, Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said. 'They looked like they were doing about 30 mph and turned right off the wharf, right into the water,' said fisherman Ray Prince, 33. 'The car just sunk.' The man came up first and swam quickly to a ladder out of the water, Prince said. 'The poor lady was screaming hysterically. Just screaming. I thought she was going to drown,' he said. The adults were described as being in fair condition but 'clearly emotionally distraught'. Firefighter Miguel Meza, who dove into the water, has been hailed a hero on the Facebook page of Los Angeles City Councilman Joe Buscaino.

'We don't know at this time whether it was an accident or an intentional event,' Humphrey said. Nearly 100 firefighters, divers and helicopter and boat crews went to the scene, Humphrey said. ABC reports that the event that led up the incident remain unknown. Witnesses told police that they heard screeching tires before the car made the plunge.

"A county in Illinois says former US Rep Aaron Schock, who redecorated his office in the decadent style of television show Downton Abbey,  should pay for the special elections to replace him. The Marshall County Board voted last week to send a bill for $76,000 to the Peoria Republican who resigned last month after questions about his extravagant government-funded spending. The letter seeks a check or a promise from Schock that he will pay for this summer's special and general election costs. County officials estimate each will run about $38,000. Former Illinois Congressional representative Aaron Schock, 33, is facing calls to pay for the special election to replace him after resigning from the House last month amid an expenses scandal . The four-term Congressman (left) attracted scrutiny for his lavish lifestyle, including many selfies with celebrities such as Ariana Grande (right), after  a Downton Abbey-style renovation to his Washington office . A Schock spokesman did not respond to an emailed request from The Associated Press seeking comment to the board's letter. His campaign fund balance is $3.3 million, The  Journal-Star reported. 'Schock has more money than the county has in its reserves,' Marshall County State's Attorney Paul Bauer said. Once seen as a media-savvy rising star in the Republican Party, Schock, 33, made appearances on Top Chef, the Colbert Report and the cover of Men's Health magazine. However, the four-term Congressman's celebrity lifestyle attracted examination of his spending habits. Earlier this year it was discovered that his office had received a $40,000 renovation funded by the taxpayer to make it look like the Edwardian Era homes on Downton Abbey. It has a crystal chandeliers and pheasant feathers in addition to its elaborately decorated furniture and bright red walls. The Republican had been viewed as a rising star in his party after a slate of media appearances including the cover of Men's Health . The extravagance of Schock's Washington office, which included pheasant feathers and a crystal chandelier, was what first drew attention to his spending . The Illinois representative originally replied to the reports by saying 'haters gonna hate'. But further investigations revealed that he took a private jet to watch an NFL game in Chicago and had spent $10,000 taking a group including his interns to a Katy Perry concert. Schock also failed to report expenditures on trips abroad, required by Congressional rules. Though he hired a high powered defense and public relations team, Schock resigned after a report from POLITICO about misrepresentations of the mileage on his publicly-funded car. He has repaid the government for his office and mileage, and his resignation likely helped him avoid an ethics inquiry into his luxury lifestyle. Shock's district now faces the task of putting together a quick election to put a representative back in Washington. A copy of the Marshall County letter went to the other 20 election jurisdictions in the 18th Congressional District, some of whom may follow the message's example. Schock (pictured with Pope Francis) is facing a federal investigation into his spending after reports about misrepresented mileage on his car and taxpayer-funded trips on a private jet . 'There are other counties who are interested, and they're kind of waiting on someone to step forward,' Marshall County Board Chairman Gary Kroeschen said. Tazewell County officials expect to pay about $200,000 for the elections and County Board Chairman David Zimmerman said a committee will discuss the issue April 22. The board could act as soon as the end of the month with the special primary election approaching in July, followed by the general election in September. Zimmerman said he hopes other counties follow Marshall's lead. The Justice Department is investigating whether Schock broke any laws with his spending.","Marshall County in Illinois requests money from resigned rep Aaron Schock .

"Tate Ricks (pictured above), nine, was reportedly fishing with his grandma's boyfriend when their boat capsized and he was not found at shore . Authorities are searching a Florida river for a nine-year-old boy who went missing after a boat carrying him and a family friend was hit with a wake causing the boat to capsize. Putnam County Sheriff's Office said Tate Ricks immediately went under water in the St Johns River and the unidentified man with him attempted to save Ricks but could not, according to CBS. The man was able to make it to shore, deputies said. On Sunday, officials said they were using sonar and thermal imaging in the water and on the coastline in efforts to rescue the boy, Captain Joe Wells told First Coast News. Officials also said they plan to continue the air search later in the day bringing in divers. They hope to continue the search as long as conditions are safe, and stated previously the operation is for a rescue and not a recovery. Ricks, a third grade student at Kelly Smith Elementary School in Palatka, was reportedly with his grandmother's boyfriend fishing when the boating accident occurred. Their 14-foot johnboat was hit by the wake from a large boat around 5.30pm, according to News4Jax. The boy is believed to not have been wearing a life jacket, according to investigators, and the impact from the wake sent them both into the river. Crews began a rescue operation on Saturday around 6pm, and officials did confirm they discovered the capsized boat. Authorities said the search area for Ricks includes the St Johns River from US-17 to Memorial Bridge to the north, and Pico Road to the south . The Wildlife Conservation Commission is leading the investigation and the sheriff's office is leading the search, according to The Florida Times-Union. 'We are not going to send crews home tonight. They will remain on the river all night long,' Wells told News4Jax. 'We will switch to a different crew in the morning and continue right on through the weekend, into next week, whatever it takes to locate this young man and bring closure to his family.' A woman who identified herself as Ricks' grandmother said the family is working to stay positive. Suzette Guess told News4Jax: 'Everybody's just trying to hang together. Come together and do a lot of praying.' She described Ricks as a 'fun-loving kid' who liked hunting, fishing and NASCAR. 'Pray that they find him and that's he's okay. Just remember us and his mama. He's got a little sister think of her too,' she added. Wells told Times-Union that the incident is being investigated as a boating accident and that no foul play is suspected.","Tate Ricks was reportedly fishing with his grandmother's boyfriend in Florida when boat was hit by wake in St Johns River on Saturday .

"Time to change: Business mogul Jack Welch has called for an end to the college hierarchy that has caused education to become cripplingly expensive . Business mogul Jack Welch has called for an end to the college hierarchy that has caused higher education to become cripplingly expensive. Speaking to DailyMail.com CEO Jon Steinberg, the former head of General Electric insisted that it's time to cut out expensive and needless middle management. He said: 'If you look at education today there are deans, there are associate deans, there are assistants to the associate deans. There's hierarchy beyond belief. 'Why should these lazy professors hang out getting fat on money while kids are going broke graduating? 'It's dumb, it's stupid, and it has to be broken.' Welch warned that this increase in middle management is driving up the cost of higher education, which is now failing to give students value for the amount of money they are forced to shell out. He told Steinberg that he is now dedicated to taking education in a new direction as executive of the Jack Welch Management Institute (JWMI), which currently has over 900 students and is growing. He said: 'At JWMI one thing is true - and this will be a big change for education - we think: 'Who is our customer?' The student is our customer. 'We have no tenure. We will remove faculty if the students call for it. 'They know when they're getting value and when they're not. They're great consumers and they give us voice' 'If we've got jerks that aren't giving them what they want, we''l have a chat with them once, and the second time they won't be there. They won't be in the next class.' The business mogul and his wife, business journalist and author Suzy Welch, were speaking at an Answers to Correspondents event at the New York's Core Club hosted by DailyMail.com and JWMI. During the intimate conversation, Welch claimed that JWMI could provide a model for what the future of graduate education can be. 'We're seeing lives change,' he said. 'It's amazing how we're changing lives with some very basic steps and an economically sound deal for us and for them.' Jack Welch (right) and his wife, business journalist and author Suzy Welch (center), were speaking with DilyMail.com CEO Jon Steinberg at an Answers to Correspondents event at the New York's Core Club . Following the release of their new book The Real-Life MBA: Your No-BS Guide to Winning the Game, Building a Team, and Growing Your Career, the couple discussed how real-world business scenarios should be used in education. Suzy Welch said: 'What's happening in business education in our school are these team-based projects that are more simulation of business troubles and business challenges, and that's better.' She pointed out that at many schools business education is being taught by academics, who lack real-world experience at a management level. 'Most of them haven't managed a thing,' she added. 'They're sitting there talking to you about leadership and they've not led a person. 'At our school, 90 per cent of the faculty are also business leaders. They are business executives who all have done PhDs. 'Anything that can be more real world really helps.'","The business mogul was speaking to DailyMail.com CEO Jon Steinberg .

"Saturday Night Live poked fun at Hillary Clinton just hours before she is set to announce she is running for president, by mocking her decision to tell the world via social media. The former Secretary of State, played by Kate McKinnon, and one of her advisers, played by Vanessa Bayer, discuss how she will declare her intentions at noon on Sunday following years of speculation. The pair decide to record a cellphone video of the Democrat for her campaign launch in a bid to make her come across as soft and approachable, following concerns she will not be able to relate to ordinary voters. During the scene, which includes a cameo from her husband Bill, they insist her second run at the White House will be about the people and not centered around her. But, despite desperate attempts to not be self-centered, Clinton seems incapable of talking about anyone but herself and brushes off her potential competitors. The show took aim at the 67-year-old as she is expected to reveal via video that she is taking another stab at what she believes is 'the highest and hardest glass ceiling'. Saturday Night Live skewered the news that Hillary Clinton would be announcing her presidential campaign on social media this week . The show portrayed the former Secretary of State as aggressive and driven, saying things like; 'Citizens, you will elect me' Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Barbra Streisand and Former US President Bill Clinton at a 2013 event. It is believed she will have a string of celebrity backers for her second White House bid . Barack Obama has already given her his backing by saying he believes she will be an 'excellent president', but the comedians on the NBC show latched onto a memo that was made public on Saturday, saying her campaign will be humble and about 'everyday Americans'. After decades in the public eye, and stints in political offices, she faces a challenge showing her more down-to-earth side. On her first try at recording the video she screams in a dictatorial manner: 'Citizens, you will elect me. I will be your leader.' For the second attempt, they try to get Clinton to stop saying 'I' or her name, but she also fails immediately. 'Hello, 'tis I, Hillary Clinton,' she says. The two women are then joined by Bill Clinton (Darrel Hammond), who sneaks up behind his wife as she is filming. He says how grateful he is that camera phones did not exist when he was president - because he would probably be in jail if they were. The former president tells America in his wife's video: 'Hillary would make a great president. And I would make an even greater first dude.' From there they decide to make talk about how difficult the election will be, and the tough challenges Clinton will face from other Democrats. She starts talking about potential rival Martin O'Malley, the former Maryland governor, but the starts laughing, saying: 'He sounds like a Simpsons character.' Her husband makes a second appearance at this point with his saxophone, playing the theme tune to The Simpsons and revealing that he will be his wife's Vice President. He adds that when she dies it will be 'Bill Clinton 2: Bigger and blacker.' After trying to quiet her husband, Clinton gives in and says; 'Who are we kidding? Buckle up America, cause the Clintons are back.' She then goes over one more problem she has with her adviser - the fact she cannot be her own vice president. Bill Clinton was also featured in the skit, urging America to elect Hillary so he could be her vice president. He adds that he will make a great 'First Dude' Once she formally announces her campaign, Clinton, like all major presidential hopefuls, will no doubt be making an appearance on the show, which this week was hosted by Empire star Tarji P. Henson. However she has been targeted by Saturday Night Live many times before. Just four weeks ago she was skewered on opening sketch following revelations over her personal emails. At the beginning of a mock interview the politician describes herself as a 'relatable woman on a couch'. 'Those emails are as clean as a whistle. What did you think those emails said? 'Hey it's Hilary I really screwed up on Benghazi'.' Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley took to Twitter on Sunday after the actress playing Clinton compared him to a 'Simpsons character' during the sketch . Referencing her probable run for president, she also insists: 'There will be no mistakes in my rise to the top.' Speaking about the release of the emails, following pressure from her opponents and the media, she says: 'Go ahead, read them, you won't find squat.' When she announces she will likely become the overwhelming favorite to win her party's nomination, with no stiff opponents expected to face her in the primaries. She will inevitably have a number of celebrity backers who will stage fundraisers for her in the coming months with reports suggesting she is looking to raise $1.1billion - double the amount Obama spent on his re-election campaign in 2012. Among them are high-profile Hollywood backers including director Steven Spielberg, and actors George Clooney, Barbra Streisand and Tom Hanks. The November 2016 election will emphasize her plans to address economic inequality and will tout the historic nature of her bid to become the first woman U.S. president, aides have said. 'Who are we kidding? Buckle up America, cause the Clintons are back,' says Hillary in the end of the skit . Clinton will also have to quell a controversy over her work use of a private email account while secretary of state, which Republicans have said is a sign of her penchant for secrecy. Clinton has said she used the single email account for convenience and should have used government email, but violated no rules. Clinton, who lost a heavyweight Democratic nominating battle to Barack Obama in 2008, will announce her campaign on video and social media, a Democrat familiar with her plans said. She will travel later in the week to Iowa, which holds the first nominating contest in early 2016. In a memo made public on Saturday, Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook told staff while the goal was for Clinton to win the presidency, the campaign was not about her. 'We are humble: we take nothing for granted, we are never afraid to lose, we always out-compete and fight for every vote we can win. We know this campaign will be won on the ground, in states,' he said in the campaign memo, titled 'We Are Hillary for America.' Many Democrats have eagerly awaited Sunday's announcement since the day in June 2008 when Clinton pulled out of her primary battle against Obama with an expression of regret that she could not crack 'that highest and hardest glass ceiling this time.' Opinion polls show Clinton has a huge lead over potential 2016 Democratic rivals, and few are expected to enter the race. A Reuters-Ipos tracking poll shows Clinton backed by more than 60 percent of Democrats. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of liberals but who says she is not running, is a distant second at 18 percent. So far, former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley and former U.S. Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, whose support languishes in single digits in polls, are the most prominent contenders to take steps toward challenging her. Republicans have been gearing up for the battle, and a big field of Republican presidential contenders is expected. Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky have been the first to formally enter the race, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will jump in on Monday. Clinton operatives have already begun reaching out to top bundlers to urge them to start calling people in their donor networks, a source familiar with the matter said. At least one West Coast bundler began making calls to top donors this past week, and will place another round of calls after the announcement Sunday, the source said. She also intends to sell herself as being able to work with Congress, businesses and world leaders. In New York on Saturday, at the final event put on by 'Ready for Hillary,' a group not connected with her campaign that's worked for the past few years to stoke excitement for it, enthusiastic supporters joined elected officials and local party leaders to celebrate the launch to come. 'After she left the State Department she could have slipped into grandmother-hood, but people want to call her back into public service,' said Jarret Berg, 29, a Democratic staffer in the New York legislature. 'It's time for her.' As her official announcement loomed, the Republican National Committee linked Clinton to Obama, a regular focus of criticism from the GOP. 'All Hillary Clinton is offering is a continuation of the same big government ideas that have grown Washington instead of the middle class,' RNC spokesman Michael Short said in a statement Saturday. 'That's why voters want fresh leadership and a new direction, not four more years of Obama's failed policies.' Clinton (pictured on UN Woman's day on March 10 addressing the email scandal) is expected to be the clear front runner from the Democratic nomination .","Opening sketch had former First Lady and adviser discussing campaign .

"A couple bought a Beanie Baby for £10 at a car boot sale - and later realised it was worth £62,500. Leah Rogers and Ryan Flanaghan were selling a range of toys at the boot sale in Bude, Cornwall, when they spotted the purple teddy at another seller's stall. As a former collector, Mr Flanaghan, 22, recognised the bear as a limited edition Princess Diana Di Beanie Baby - one of the most sought after in the collection which can be worth thousands of pounds. Scroll down for video . Leah Rogers and Ryan Flanaghan (pictured together left) picked up a rare purple Beanie Baby for £10 at a car boot sale in Bude, Cornwall - and later found out it was worth £62,500 . The bear turned out to be one of just 100 made around the world, made in December 1997 for the Princess of Wales Memorial Trust. They are now selling it on eBay, with a starting bid of £20,000 . But the builder was stunned to find out that the bear was one of just 100 made around the world - and that another version is currently listed on eBay for £62,500. The pair are now hoping to sell the bear on the auction site and put the money towards a deposit for a house. Miss Rogers, 20, a beauty therapist who lives in Launceston, Cornwall, said: 'We couldn't believe it. We picked it up for £10 and it could be worth tens of thousands. 'It's so hard for young people to get on the property ladder so we think this could really be a blessing.' The pair had gone along to the car boot sale on Bank Holiday Monday with Mr Flanaghan's parents where they sold some of his old toys, including Beanie Babies. Before putting the teddies in the pile, the couple looked online to check that none of the bears would count as collectors' items. The pair, from Launceston, Cornwall, are now hoping the sale of the bear will give them a deposit for a house . While online, they read up about a Princess Diana Di Beanie Baby, which can sell for huge amounts. The range was created in December 1997 - the year the princess died - to raise money for the Princess of Wales Memorial Trust. It includes a poem on the tag which refers to Diana as an 'angel'. But even when he spotted the bear at another seller's stall, Mr Flanaghan had no idea whether it was a 'first edition' bear - which are incredibly rare - or a second edition, which sells for just £20. They later discovered the bear was handmade in Indonesia in December 2007 with special PE pellets and wording on the tag, which refers to the Princess Of Wales Memorial Fund - all of which make it a first edition bear. There is also a poem which reads: 'Like an angel she came from heaven above; she shared her compassion, her pain, her love; she only stayed with us long enough to teach the world to share, to give, to reach.' Another first edition Diana bear, the same as the one belonging to Miss Rogers and Mr Flanaghan, is currently being listed on eBay for £62,500 . Miss Rogers said: 'Ryan and his sister used to collect Beanie Babies so before we sold a load we just wanted check that they weren't worth anything. 'As we were looking, we saw that this purple bear was the rarest bear and it was going for around £20,000. We didn't think anything of it. 'But when we went to the car boot sale the next day, Ryan went off for a walk and came back clutching this bag. He said: ""It's that bear that we saw on the internet last night"".' The couple put it up for auction last night, with a starting bid of £20,000. A spokesman for Beanie fan club Ty Collector said only a handful of people know how many Process Bears were produced. The Beanie Babies were first introduced to the public in 1993, when creators Ty Warner Inc, which later became Ty Inc, launched its original line consisting of just nine characters. Over the next few years however hundreds of different types of Beanie Baby were produced as they gained in popularity. The company made an empire worth more than $6billion from the toys, boosted by the increase in people buying them as popular collectibles in 1995. At the peak of the collecting craze, many believed the designs which had been 'retired' would rise in value. The craze however failed to last much longer than 1999. Nowadays hundreds of the cuddly toys are sold on sites such as eBay - but they are not always worth as much money as collectors would originally have hoped. However, there are some which have certainly increased in price, including the 'ultra rare' Ty Princess Diana Di Beanie Baby, first edition, which can be sold for tens of thousands of pounds.","Leah Rogers, 20, and Ryan Flanaghan, 22, bought bear in Bude, Cornwall .

"Kansas is one signature away from telling poor families that it's illegal to use their welfare payments to buy alcohol, tobacco and pornography, to visit strip clubs or tattoo shops, and to take vacation cruises or gamble on dog or horse races. Swimming pools, jewelry and lingerie stores, psychics, movie theatre, nail salons, massage parlors, bars and theme parks will also be forbidden territory for the first time, if Republican Gov. Sam Brownback signs a bill that hit his desk last week. The proposal would also give the force of state law to some of brownback's policies, including one that requires 'temporary cash assistance' recipients to hold down jobs, look for work or enroll in job training programs. NO BENEFITS: A pending Kansas law would make it illegal for welfare recipients to spend their government-supplied stipends at strip clubs, among a laundry list of other places . NO INK: Kansas welfare recipients who want taxpayers to shell out for their tattoos have until July 1 to experiment with the latest in body art . PARTISAN: Kansas Republican Gov. Sam Brownback (center) is likely to sign the new measure despite strong opposition from Democrats . Kansans, like citizens of many other states, are issued debit cards when they register for state-based welfare. Under the rules of the bill passed in the state legislature, bail-bondsmen would no longer be allowed to accept the cards as payment. Recipients would be limited, for the first time, to withdrawing  $25 in cash per day. Liberal lawmakers complained that some welfare recipients use their debit cards to get funds for rent payments. Democratic state Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau told the Topeka Capital-Journal that forcing those people to make multiple trips to bank machines to pay their bills 'is ludicrous. It is outrageous.' State Rep. Carolyn Bridges, another Democrat, complained during a legislative debate that putting limits on how the poor can spend taxpayer dollars says to them: 'If you are asking for assistance in this state, you're sort of less than other people and we're going to tell you how and where to spend your money.' NECESSITIES: Tobacco will be added to the no-no list, along with movie tickets, cruise vactions and lingerie . I SEE A JOB IN YOUR FUTURE: Fortune tellers and psychics? Out. Job training? In. CONFLICT: Republican state Rep. Kansas state Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady (left) insists that getting welfare recipients 'back to work' justifies the new law, while state Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau (right) called it 'ludicrous' and 'outrageous' But state Sen. Michael O’Donnell, the Republican who gathered support for a House bill putting all the changes into place, said public assistance should be spent 'more responsibly' than it had been in the past. 'We’re trying to make sure those benefits are used the way they were intended' – on food and necessities like diapers or toiletries, O’Donnell told the paper. The Brownback administration has signaled its support for the measure. It has already presided over a 60 per cent drop in the number of Kansans enrolled in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, known as TANF, during his first term in office. When Brownback became governor in 2011, the program served 38,900 people statewide. Today that number has dwindled to 15,500, according to statistics compiled by the Kansas Department for Children and Families. Numbers of food stamp recipients – a completely separate category of government welfare – have ticked down by just 6 per cent during the same period, however. Poverty rates among children have remained constant, according to the social-services nonprofit group Kansas Action for Children . The clash of statistics has raised questions about whether the state has actually been moving people off of TANF and into jobs. VICIOUS CIRCLE? Benefits recipients were previously permitted to spend their government money to bail themselves and family members out of jail . YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK: Until Brownback became governor, welfare enrollees could buy liquor with their benefit debit cards, but now his policy is likely to become a law that future pols will find it hard to undo . 'This is serious, good policy for the state of Kansas,' state Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady, a Palco Republican, told the Associated Press. 'There's nothing better to get these people back on their feet than getting them a job and getting them back to work.' But Democratic state Sen. Laura Kelly countered in the Capital-Journal that 'we pat ourselves on the back that our TANF rolls have gone down exponentially and we say it’s because all those people are now working,' but 'we don’t know that and I’m guessing its not the truth.' Another Democratic lawmaker, state Rep. Barbara Ballard, complained during a debate that telling welfare recipients that they can't use their state benefits to visit swimming pools would give the poor one fewer way to stay healthy. Republicans control both the Kansas House and Senate by wide margins. THe House vote was 87-35, and the Senate passed the bill 30-10. If Brownback signs the bill, it will go into effect in July.","'Temporary Assistance for Needy Families' funds can buy goods and services beyond food and necessities intended by program's designers .
Tattoos, manicures, lingerie, jewelry, movie tickets, cruises and pornography will also be off the list if Gov. Sam Brownback signs a bill .
Republicans in Kansas also want to limit benefit recipients to $25 per day in cash withdrawals with their government-issued welfare debit cards .
Democrats say it's mean-spirited and will make welfare enrollees think they're 'less' valuable 'than other people'
Brownback's administration has shrunk the TANF rolls by 60 per cent since 2011; the law would also force recipients to try to find work ."
"Frightened: Diana Doyle was plagued with cold calls . A firm linked to the sale of NHS patient data is offering details of eating disorder sufferers for just 12p a head, the Mail can reveal today. It has also offered to supply names of those suffering from stress, hair loss, dandruff, impotence and snoring. Even details of dieters and those who have had plastic surgery appear on the list of data for sale. The Mail has this week exposed companies that have secretly sold private financial and medical information without proper checks. Our investigation has revealed that: . The revelations have prompted probes by the Information Commissioner’s Office and the Direct Marketing Commission. A third investigation has been launched by the General Pharmaceutical council into Pharmacy2U, the UK’s biggest online pharmacy. The Mail revealed that Pharmacy2U had passed information on NHS patients to Alchemy Direct Media. The eating disorder data – passed to the Mail by a whistleblower – is being touted by a firm called Sequester, which is a business partner of Alchemy. Sequester is offering to sell information on people suffering from 43 different health conditions – from skin problems to insomnia and migraines. It claims to be able to identify those who have had plastic surgery, who smoke, wear glasses or contact lenses or have sensitive teeth. It also appears to offer details of which credit cards people have and which banks they use, as well as whether they have wills or health insurance. Such data is a goldmine for unscrupulous firms and criminals – who can use it to target vulnerable individuals and scam them over the phone. The whistleblower, who works in the data industry, said it was ‘madness’ that so much personal information was available to him and he had passed it to the Mail because he was worried about who else might have access to it. He said: ‘I am not registered with the regulators, I’m just a man who has worked in the industry at some point – and all this information is available to me. It’s absolute madness.’ The list of categories of data was contained in an email – seen by the Mail – from Sequester’s CEO Matthew Foy in which he described the information his firm was able to supply on its new database. At the top of the email, he writes: ‘Please do not distribute this list.’ The whistleblower said: ‘Imagine who else could get their hands on this. When I realised the level of information companies like Sequester have, that is when I knew how serious a problem this is. ‘We give our private health and financial details to people we trust, it is not fair they end up in the hands of people we don’t.’ He said he had been sent databases containing records of thousands of people’s pensions, investments and intimate health details. Dr Sarah Wollaston, who was the Tory chairman of the Commons health committee, said 'it's appalling' One of those on Sequester’s arthritis database is Diana Doyle from Wandsworth in London, who says she is ‘frightened’ her health details are being sold on. The grandmother, whose husband suffers from vascular dementia and is in a home, added: ‘I’m a very private person, I always say, “No thank you” when asked for my details. ‘I’m on my own at home now, so this is very frightening.’ She suspects her medical details were obtained from a survey she filled out in a catalogue. The 74-year-old has had to change her home phone number because she was getting so many nuisance calls. Dr Sarah Wollaston, who was the Tory chairman of the Commons health committee, last night said: ‘It is appalling that this kind of deeply personal and sensitive information is being traded. It is deeply worrying.’ When approached by the Mail, bosses at Sequester, which describes itself as a data controller, claimed they had never actually distributed any information on eating disorders or any of the other sensitive health information advertised in the email. Chief executive Mr Foy said the company did not hold such information and that his email had simply been saying that ‘this list is available on the market, that we could find it for a client’. ‘That does not necessarily mean it is available for release,’ he said. Watchdog will probe 'rogue' data firms who sold Mail's undercover reporters the financial data of 15,000 people . By Lucy Osborne . Two firms exposed by the Daily Mail as selling private information are to be probed by the industry watchdog. B2C Data sold our undercover reporters the financial data of 15,000 people – including details about their pension pots, incomes and investments. The second firm – Data Bubble – supplied our team with health details on 3,000 patients – such as whether they suffered from high blood pressure, arthritis or even bladder problems. The Direct Marketing Commission said it would probe both companies over claims that they had breached the rules on the sale of private data. It confirmed it was ‘formally investigating two companies following allegations in the Daily Mail that personal data was shared inappropriately and without the consent of users’. George Kidd, the chief commissioner, said: ‘The allegations in the Daily Mail are serious. People must be able to trust those with whom they share their data. We will look carefully at the roles and conduct of these two companies and advise the Direct Marketing Association on our findings quickly.’ The firms are already at the centre of a major probe by the Information Commissioner’s Office, which said the sale of such details was ‘on the face of it, a very serious breach of the Data Protection Act’. In meetings covertly filmed by our reporters, bosses at B2C Data were seen boasting of how they held thousands of details on every family in Britain. One, Gareth Doran, boasted: ‘We know what clothes they buy, what health products they buy, where they go on holiday, how many times they go on holiday, what income they’ve got, whether they have children.’ Data Bubble bosses offered to provide our reporters with the names of people with ‘different ailments’ for around 16p each. When asked how the information was obtained, the firm’s owner, hypnotherapist Joanne Clayton, said: ‘It could be people who bought mobility products from a catalogue … or even if they’ve been on holiday and they’ve ticked to say that they are needing help on the flight with regards to that, we can then identify that they actually have problems with mobility.’ Both companies sold the records despite not carrying out checks on the Mail’s bogus cold calling firm. Had they done so they would have quickly discovered it was simply a website and was not registered or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. The announcement follows calls – led by David Cameron – for a clampdown on companies found guilty of selling personal data without consent. The Prime Minister suggested on Monday night that the law would be tightened if loopholes were being exploited by unscrupulous cold callers.","Sequester is offering details of eating disorder sufferers for 12p a head .

"They call themselves the 'Thelma and Louise of Wellness' and they've taken mindfulness to the boardrooms of Australia. Shannah Kennedy and Lyndall Mitchell, who between them have been more than three decades of life coaching experience, are teaching their Masterclass Of Wellness to CEOs and executives across the country. Skills such as dealing with stress, being aware of trains of thought, and accumulative mindfulness are being taught to professionals in the banking, business and retail sector. 'Wellness in the past has all been about the zen... But actually you can be wearing leather pants, and be zen,' Shannah told Daily Mail Australia. Thelma and Louise of Wellness: Shannah Kennedy (left) and Lyndall Mitchell (right) are taking their Masterclass of Wellness: The Boardroom Retreat to CEOs and executives across Australia . Breathe deep: They teach skills and strategies which can be implemented into people's every day lives . 'You can be groovier, you don’t have to be in your hessian pants because it’s got to be relevant for corporates,' she added. The pair's workshop, aptly named the Masterclass Of Wellness: The Boardroom Retreat, is a way for executives and their staff to learn a set of skills that will help them every day. 1. Create good habits that support you: Make sure you always have a 'reward' built in to the habit for example when you go for a run allow yourself to walk the final few blocks home, or grab a coffee. 2. Reset throughout the day: As a stress reset try and take three deep breaths feeling your belly move rather than your chest. Do this as often as possible so you're building on an accumulative practice. 3.Use your phone as a form of healthcare: Have your key values programmed into your phone to pop up each morning and let these guide your decisions. 4. Set small sustainable habits: It's the small things you do that have the biggest impact. Look at something you already do and how can you make that into a habit. For example using your commuting time effectively by listening to an audiobook. 5. Set technology boundaries: Switch off at least an hour before you go to bed at night, and don't check work emails until you're at your desk and able to deal with them. It takes attendees through a number of self-reflective activities, asking them to identify their key values and areas where they would like to improve. Four mediation sessions are spread throughout the workshops,which are filled with facts such as 80 per cent of thoughts can be negative, and 98 per cent may be the same as the previous day. 'One in six staff members now suffer from a form of mental illness, whether it be stress, anxiety, depression or suicide,' Shannah revealed. 'People don’t go and have a day off because they have the flu, they actually need a mental health day.' Through their courses they work with executives and staff from organisations such as NAB, Macquarie Bank, PwC, kikki,K, Sportsgirl, Commonwealth Bank, Hewlett Packard and Mercedes Benz to help individuals and business be the most effective they can be. Asked whether there is any resistance to something that was once seen as 'hippie' or 'new age', the women said they have not experienced any, but instead have been overwhelmed by the amount of people taking it on board. 'I've found in a lot of corporates that’s shifting a little bit, because the consequence is too expensive for them' Shannah revealed. 'When their staff blow up and their staff do get depressed and are away the cost of replacing them is too much,' she added. Through their courses the pair teach different strategies and activities that can be implemented into daily life which stop staff 'burning out'. Decades of experience: Shannah (left) has been a life coach for 15 years, while Lyndall (right) started her career in a wellness retreat . Crash and burn: Lyndall and Shannah help CEOs and executives avoid career burnouts and balance all elements of their lives . 'There’s all these different trains of thought in our mind, which train are you on?' Lyndall, who started working at a health retreat 22 years ago, said. 'Knowing that we have a choice because 80 percent of our thoughts can be negative, and 98 per cent can be the same as yesterday. 'We have 60,000-80,000 thoughts a day so that’s a lot of activity, so if you imagine you’re standing at a train station, that’s a lot of activity going on,' she continued. Practices such as meditation and even simple reminders of priorities are taught to help people stay on top of their game. Shannah knows only too well the toll a demanding career can have on one's health and wellbeing, and the implications of it crashing down around you. 'I studied coaching after having chronic fatigue after a total burnout in the corporate world,' she revealed. '(I) Studied coaching, coached athletes into retirement and then turned corporate, so I now coach CEOs, state managers, business owners and have done so for a long time, Shannah added. Creating good habits: The pair share a number of key tips which help staff take control of their lives and be the best version of themselves . Thelma and Louise: Shannah and Lyndall liken themselves to the duo from the 1991 film . Whereas Lyndall's background is 'looking after type A achievers like Shannah'. 'I grew up in a remote part of Queensland and ended up working at Camp Eden health retreat, which was two doors away from my family home. 'That cemented my passion for wellness so helping people overcome self-destructive behaviours, so alcohol addiction, drug addiction. 'But then I decided retreat experiences are fantastic but how do you integrate this back into the real world?,' Lyndall said. It was around this time that the women met in a park while out with their kids, and decided to combine their knowledge to make it accessible for a wider audience. Busy lives: As well as travelling teaching their masterclass, Lyndall (left) runs Aurora Spas and a training college, while Shannah (right) life coaches high profile athletes such as Brett Lee, but say they 'don't do stress' As well as travelling teaching their masterclass, Lyndall runs Aurora Spas and a training college, while Shannah life coaches high profile athletes such as Brett Lee, and executives such as the director of PwC, Cade Brow. 'We've got the busiest lives you've ever seen, but we don’t do stress,' Shannah said. 'It’s just having the right skill set to support yourself'. Some of the women's other high profile clients include former Olympian Benita Willis, Founder and Creative Director of kikki.K Kristina Karlsson, and media personality Deborah Hutton. They also work with executives at Macquarie Bank and NAB - who they are about to embark on a national tour with, working with staff across all levels over the coming weeks. When it comes down to it, Shannah and Lyndall say they simply help people to be the 'best version of themselves'. 'It's about putting you back as the main priority,' Lyndall said.","Shannah Kennedy and Lyndall Mitchell are 'Thelma and Louise of wellness'

"A Moroccan limo company owner is believed to have shot four members of his family before taking his own life after a dispute over the business turned deadly. Police believe that 50-year-old Driss Diaeddinn bought a semi-automatic handgun and shot his brothers, 38-year-old Reda Diaeddinn and 56-year-old Dodi Fayed, and their mother, 76-year-old Kenza Benzakour, on the ground floor of their Phoenix, Arizona home at 2pm on Thursday. He then is believed to have gone upstairs to shoot dead his sister-in-law, 26-year-old Meriem Ben Yahia, before taking his own life, police said. Police said it appears the man and his relatives were in an on-going dispute over the family business. ABC 15 reported that he shot each victim in a way that ensured they were dead. Scroll down for video . The bodies of three women and two women were discovered in a northern suburb of Phoenix, Arizona on Thursday afternoon. Aerial footage shows a SWAT team entering the house in the aftermath . Phoenix Police Department officers stand out in front of a home in the aftermath of the shooting . They believe the shooting occurred after a family dispute and believe one of the dead family members had shot their relatives before taking their own life. A single gun was found at the scene . His wife and two children, aged three and 10 months, were able to escape and shed called 911.

As Guthrie rattled off a list of issues where she said the senator had flipped and flopped – Iran, aid to Israel and defense spending – a testy and impatient Paul cut her off. 'Why don't we let me explain instead of talking over me, OK?' he griped. PRICKLY: Newly minted White House hopeful Rand Paul and NBC host Savannah Guthrie talked over each other on Wednesday . Paul, a libertarian-leaning Kentucky senator, launched his presidential bid on Tuesday in Louisville . 'No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!' Listen, you've editorialized,' Paul blasted at Guthrie . 'Before we go through a litany of things you say I've changed on, why don't you ask me a question: ""Have I changed my opinion?"" That would be sort of a better way to approach an interview.' Guthrie obliged, asking him if he had changed his views, but he charged ahead. 'No, no, you've editorialized,' Paul said. 'No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!' Listen, you've editorialized. Let me answer a question! You ask a question, and you say, ""Have your views changed?"" instead of editorializing and saying my views have changed.' A spokesman for American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal opposition-research group, leaped on Paul after the broadcast. 'Rand Paul can't seem to step in front of a camera without proving that shooting from the hip is a good way to shoot yourself in the foot,' Ben Ray told Daily Mail Online. 'He's got miles to go before his ability catches up to his ambition,' Ray added. 'And judging by his temper, he knows it, too.' When style gave way to substance on TODAY, Paul clarified that when he said in 2007 that Iran wasn't a threat to the United States, the world was different and he wasn't yet a candidate for the Senate. '2007 was a long time ago and events do change over long periods of time,' he said. 'So we're talking about 8 years ago. We're talking about a time when I wasn't running for office and I was helping someone else run for office.' That 'someone else' was his father, Ron Paul, a former congressman who ran for president three times but never grabed the brass ring. The elder Paul was known for strictly non-interventionist views overseas in the face of growing threats abroad, a trap that his son has taken great pains to avoid. 'There has always been a threat around gaining nuclear weapons and that's greater now than it was many years ago,' he said Wednesday. His troublesome 2007 moment came during an interview with conspiracy-theorist radio host Alex Jones. 'You know, it’s ridiculous to think they’re a threat to our national security,' Paul said then of Iran. 'It’s not even that viable to say they’re a national threat to Israel,' he added later. 'Most people say Israel has 100 nuclear weapons, you know.' On the TODAY show, Paul the younger avoided taking a stand on the nuclear agreement the White House says it has carved out with Tehran's mullahs. Paul was joined by his wife Kelley Ashby on stage Tuesday as he declared that he would campaign to 'take our country back' 'I'm going to keep an open mind and look at the agreement,' Paul said, while allowing that 'I do believe that negotiation is better than war.' He mirrored other Republicans in questioning the 'sincerity of the Iranians' in reaching an agreement with the U.S. and five European nations. 'If they're immediately saying that the agreement doesn't mean what President Obama says, that is a big problem,' Paul said. 'The Iranians put out 500 words, the Americans put out 1,300 words, the Europeans put out 200 words. And they don't all seem to agree, but it's very, very little information so far.' He defended his position on foreign aid, saying that even Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed that his country should one day shake off its dependence on America to fund its defense program. 'I still agree with my original precept, which is – lemme answer the question! – I still agree with my original statement from years ago that ultimately all nations should be free of foreign aid,' he said, 'because we shouldn't borrow money to do it.' 'But my opinion's not any different than Netanyahu's opinion.' The Paul campaign did not respond to a request for comment no whether or not Guthrie gave him a fair interview.","Paul is already under fire for his evolving views on Iran, foreign aid to Israel and defense spending .
Why don't we let me explain instead of talking over me, OK?' he asked the 'TODAY' host as she tried to corner him .
Paul launched his presidential quest on Tuesday in Kentucky andis already on a five-state campaign swing .
He pinned his 2007 claim that Iran was not a threat to the US on the fact that he was campaigning for his father's presidential bid at the time ."
"As a mother of five children, economist Vicky Pryce might need a helping hand more than your average mum. However, the revelation that she'd rather have a good au pair than a husband is perhaps more of a reflection on her relationship with her own ex husband, disgraced former Lib Dem MP Chris Huhne, than it is a general statement about child-rearing. Greek-born Pryce, who famously spent two months at Her Majesty's pleasure after being convicted of perverting the course of justice for taking Huhne's speeding fines, has been speaking about life post prison and how she's handled a stellar, if not tumultuous, career - all while bringing up her brood. Despite having a high-flying career, Vicky Pryce has managed to raise five children...but admits she would miss them when work commitments came calling . Speaking to the Times, the author, who since her stint behind bars, which ended in May 2013, has written a book about life in women's prisons, says that her advice to women would be to 'be as independent as you possibly can.' The economist is said to now be enjoying the company of former MP and convicted fraudster Denis MacShane but with two failed marriages behind her, it seems that good childcare has been essential to raising her own children. Returning to the workplace within two months with each of her children required her to take a tough 'cry it out' approach with them, she says. Pryce, 62, freely admits that within just weeks of their birth, her offspring were put into their own room and left to cry until they learned to soothe themselves back to sleep. The worst episode saw one of her children scream it for two hours, she says. Something has to give: Pryce, pictured here in 2013 with Professor Noreena Hertz (left) admits she never baked cakes for her children and would often be late for parties . Pryce admits to not knowing the names of her children's friends while they were growing up and that she sacrificed more traditional motherly duties such as cake baking or preparing costumes in favour of her career. Maternal guilt didn't plague her though but she does admit to missing her children dreadfully while absent from them with work commitments. 'For me it is not guilt, it is missing them. That is the issue. If you start feeling guilty you’ve had it really.' After child number five, she admits she returned to work for a meeting within a week of her baby's birth and says she found it surprisingly easy to switch off. She said: 'The interesting thing is that as soon as I got into the cab, I immediately switched my brain to work brain. When you’re here with a baby you don’t actually think you can do it. But you can. And I did.' Romance? Vicky Pryce, pictured arriving at Southwark court for her sentencing in 2013, is said to be 'close' to former MP and convicted fraudster Denis MacShane . No love lost: Pictured with ex-husband Chris Huhne. The couple both served time in prison for perverting the course of justice over speeding fines issued in 2003 . Pryce, who speaks four languages, advocates too an early return to work as a way of battling post-natal depression, saying that 'you can't afford to have the baby blues' if you're charged with holding down a job and a family. After a high-profile career with professional services goliath KPMG, she worked as a government advisor before coming unstuck when she lied to the police about taking her former husband's speeding points. She was jailed in March 2013. Her trial heard she only revealed she had taken them to exact revenge on her cheating husband and 'nail him' after he left her for another woman. Former Energy Secretary Huhne was clocked driving too fast in March 2003 and persuaded Pryce to take the blame so he could avoid losing his licence. The couple separated after 26 years of marriage in 2010 after Mr Huhne admitted he was having an affair with his PR adviser Carina Trimingham, 46. After nearly two years proclaiming his innocence and fighting to have the case dropped, Huhne changed his plea at the start of the pair's trial at Southwark Crown Court, promptly resigning as Liberal Democrat MP for Eastleigh and ending his political career. Ms Pryce – who started her sentence in Holloway, Britain’s toughest women’s jail – was inspired by her experiences to write a book about how and why women end up in prison – and to express her concerns about the way they are treated there. She embraced prison life, taking part in karaoke and playing bingo for the first time, before being released on a tag.","Former government advisor reveals no-nonsense child-rearing secrets .

"This spot in Colorado's Vail Valley is so picturesque that a family stopped at nothing to build their home here - even if it meant shelling out $1 million just on the driveway. The Italian-inspired mansion, which has incredible 360-degree views across the mountains, has now gone on the market for a tidy $29.5 million. Homeowner Dick Rothkopf, a former toy company chief, chose the location for the estate in 2008 because his family enjoyed hiking in the nearby hills. But the property is so remote that it took two years, a team of engineers and $1 million to build the 1.5-mile driveway from the roadway to its front door, the Wall Street Journal reported. Incredible: This Italian-inspired mansion in the mountains of Vail, Colorado has gone on sale for $29.5 million . Stunning: The home, which was built in 2008, is made from materials brought over from the homeowner's trips to Italy .

Opulent: The entire property has eight bedrooms and eight full bathrooms over two buildings, as well as an outdoor barn . European: The luxurious home is known as 'Il Podere' - which means 'family homestead' in the Tuscan region . No details were spared at the 17,000-square-foot estate itself, either. The home, which is known as 'Il Podere' - meaning 'family homestead' - was built on 230 acres of land using materials collected during the Rothkopfs' trips to Italy. It features a main residence with seven bedrooms, seven full bathrooms, three half bathrooms, an elevator and a gourmet kitchen across 13,000 square foot. There's also a billiard room, a gym, an indoor basketball court and a home theater. Outside is a pool with a spa and sauna, a pool house, a two-car garage and a tennis court, as well as a lake, a pond, a stream and stunning views.

Serene: The home is 25 minutes from Vail's ski slopes and less than two hours from Aspen . Picturesque: The family who built the property chose this spot in Vail because they enjoyed hiking there . There is also a 2,000-square-foot caretaker's house, with one bedroom and one-and-a-half bathrooms, while a separate barn also houses a loft and a bathroom. And if the home itself doesn't offer enough entertainment, it's just 25 minutes from Vail's ski slopes, an hour and 45 minutes from Aspen and two hours from Denver. The listing with Douglas Elliman calls the estate 'breathtakingly beautiful, tranquil, pristine'. The family is leaving to build a home in Sonoma, California but plans to buy a smaller place in Vail so they can still make use of its slopes. Large: As well as a separate building for a caretaker, the estate also has a barn with a loft and a bathroom . Determined: Its current owners were intent on living at the location so built a $1 million to the house . Vistas: A swimming pool and terrace area gives unobstructed views across the valley . Restful: There is also a spa and a sauna at the home, as well as a separate one-bedroom caretaker's house . Great outdoors: The estate, which also has a stream and pond, stretches across nearly 17,000 square foot . Secluded: The driveway, which is a mile and a half long, took a team of engineers and two years to build . Incline: The lengthy driveway also takes visitors up 700ft towards the sprawling estate .","The Colorado estate was built in 2008 using materials from Italy and gives the homeowners a 360-degree unobstructed view of the Vail Valley .

"A 16-year-old transgender girl who spoke about being bullied at school in Fallbrook, California killed herself, a support group said, raising questions about what educators can and should do to support students who change gender identity. Taylor Alesana described her struggles in one of the many videos she posted to her fans last November, saying; 'I’ve lost tons of friends, tons. And it’s been hell. I go to school every day, and I get my lunch and I sit down alone.' She took her life on April 2. Scroll down for video . Taylor Alesana (above) of Fallbrook, California took her own life on April 2 after being bullied because she was transgender . The North County LGBTQ Resource Center said the young woman did not have the support she needed from her school and adults, and sometimes was forced to dress as a boy (above in photo from 2 years ago) 'With few adults to turn to, and with no support from her school, her life became too difficult,' the North County LGBTQ Resource Center said. 'Taylor was a beautiful and courageous girl, and all she wanted was acceptance.' Alesana attended meetings at the center and was very supportive of other transgender teens, said Max Disposti, the group's executive director, even posting a series of online videos describing her daily experiences and struggles. Alesana had a strong relationship with her counselor at Fallbrook High School, north of San Diego, but school administrators 'didn't take the necessary steps,' said Disposti. They never contacted his organization, even after a Thursday night vigil at its Oceanside office that was attended by Alesana's parents and about 200 others, he said. Fallbrook Union High School District Superintendent Hugo Pedroza said in a statement that a student died tragically on April 2. 'It is never easy when something like this happens, but we are working to move forward together and stronger than before,' he said. Alesana said in one of her videos last years on YouTube; 'Lately, I've gotten a lot of drama from the school itself.' The 16-year-old had a popular YouTube channel in which she discussed her struggles and the bullying she faced . She said in one; 'I’ve lost tons of friends, tons. And it’s been hell. I go to school every day, and I get my lunch and I sit down alone' She is the second transgender teen who sought services at the North County LGBTQ Resource Center to die by suicide since March, said Disposti. Leelah Alcorn - On December 28, 2014, Alcorn, 17, walked into oncoming traffic in Ohio, with her suicide not later appearing on Tumblr expressing her desire for her death to start a dialogue about lack of support for transgender persons. Zander Mahaffey - The 15-year-old cited family bullying in his suicide note, and there was outcry from many when after he took his life on February 15, only his birth name and female pronouns were used in his obituary. Melonie Rose - The 19-year-old from Maryland took her life in February, and according to one attendee was dressed like a man during her open casket funeral. Ash Haffner - Haffner, 16, took his own life after he was constantly bullied, walking into the path of a car on February 26. Blake Brockington - The high school student from Charlotte, North Carolina who made headlines when he was named Homecoming King earlier this year and who was a huge advocate for the community took his own life in March. Sage-David - A young man from the same community as Alesana and who attended the same support group, he took his own life in March, though he was living in a supportive environment and may have been dealing with his mother's death years before. A boy, Sage-David, who took his life last month had a supportive environment at home and school, but he struggled with other issues, including his mother's death. Alesana was unusually vocal about the challenges of being a transgender teen. 'She was very outspoken and had incredibly positive energy,' Disposti said. 'She was helping others as she was struggling.' She told people in one of her final videos; 'My biggest advice to anyone who’s transgender and struggling? You’re becoming yourself.' This news comes just after President Obama called for an end to conversion therapy for gat and transgender Americans. The White House released a statement in a response to a petition started after 17-year-old transgender youth Leelah Alcorn took her life late last year received over 120,000 signatures. 'We share your concern about its potentially devastating effects on the lives of transgender as well as gay, lesbian, bisexual and queer youth,' Valerie Jarrett, President Obama's senior adviser, said in the statement. 'As part of our dedication to protecting America’s youth, this administration supports efforts to ban the use of conversion therapy for minors.' She later said of Alcorn while speaking to the press; 'It was tragic, but I will tell you, unfortunately, she has a lot of company. It’s not the story of one young person. It is the story of countless young people who have been subjected to this.' Alesana is the seventh transgender youth reported to have committed suicide this year in the United States. Her family is not releasing the details of her death. For confidential support call National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or Transgender Lifeline on +187 756 588 60.

"An Australian couple who abandoned a boy born in a surrogacy deal in India were repeatedly told the child would be left stateless, new evidence shows. Documents reveal the shocking details of the case that saw a couple return to Australia with a baby girl while leaving her twin brother behind. Australian government officials had full knowledge of the startling ordeal, according to documents obtained the ABC. An Australian couple who abandoned a boy born in a surrogacy deal in India were repeatedly told the child would be left stateless, new evidence shows (stock image) The FOI documents reportedly show staff at the Australian High Commission in India and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were aware the couple was from New South Wales, where it is illegal to enter into international surrogacy arrangements. Conversations between the Australian High Commission in New Delhi and Government officials in Canberra detail how the couple travelled to India in late 2012 and seeked citizenship for a baby girl but told consular staff they would be leaving her twin brother behind because they could not afford him. The couple reportedly told staff they wanted a baby girl to 'complete their family'. The Australian man told consulate staff he would be giving the boy to some friends in India 'who were unable to conceive a child', according to the report. The couple was told the boy would be left stateless if they followed through on plans to abandon him, because India does not recognise surrogate children as citizens. Documents reveal the shocking details of the case that saw a couple return to Australia with a baby girl while leaving her twin brother behind . 'If the parents do not apply for Australian citizenship for the child, the child will be stateless in India... our ability to provide assistance to a non Australian citizen is limited,' a DFAT email in December, 2012 said. There were also fears last year that the boy may have been sold. Chief Justice of the Family Court, Diana Bryant, said  consular staff had told her of their concerns. The FOI documents reportedly show staff at the Australian High Commission in India and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were aware the couple was from New South Wales, where it is illegal to enter into international surrogacy arrangements . 'They expressed to me that in fact money had changed hands, and if that's true, then that's basically trafficking children,' she said. 'We're commoditising children and that's a huge concern. It's in breach of all sorts of human rights conventions – it's a criminal offence in many places.' If money was paid, any adoption would be deemed invalid under India's Hindu Adoption Act. The Indian case is similar to the recent baby Gammy case, who was born in Thailand to a surrogate mother and whose Australian parents only brought back his twin sister. The full story will be shown on ABC's Foreign Correspondent at 8pm on Tuesday .","Australian couple who abandoned baby knew they were breaking the law .

"Sending post to space is problematic, so when a teenager from Houston, Texas, wanted to send a message to her astronaut father, she had to be creative. 13-year-old Stephanie decided that long-distance phone calls weren't enough and she wanted to given her father a visual note of how much she missed him while he was away. The next time the NASA employee was up in space, she decided to create a huge art project in the desert that he would be able to see from the International Space Station. The message 13-year-old Stephanie wrote to her father in Nevada’s Delamar Dry Lake . Her father is a keen photographer and likes to take pictures of the earth when he is floating in space. Stephanie thought she could use his hobby to send him a message from back on earth. She enlisted the help of car manufacturer Hyundai to make the earth drawing, that has now broken a world record for its size. The car company used eleven sedans to draw the message on the land in Nevada’s Delamar Dry Lake, that read ‘Steph [hearts] you!’ using coordinates and a helicopter. Stephanie drew the note on paper and worked with Hyundai to get it copied onto a large land surface . 11 cars wrote the message in the dusty land in Nevada’s Delamar Dry Lake using coordinates and a helicopter. Her father took a picture of the image from space to show his daughter that her plan had worked. Measuring 5,556,411.86 square metres or 59,808,480.26 square feet, the Guinness World Record has now declared it the largest tire track image ever.

"More than 70 animals have been seized from a filthy mobile home belonging to an animal hoarder banned from keeping pets. Police raided the house of John Koepke, in Wittmann, Arizona and found 54 dogs and 18 cats living in disgusting, cramped conditions.

Scroll down for video . More than 70 animals have been seized from a filthy mobile home belonging to John Koepke who was banned from keeping pets . One of the cats at the mobile home in Arizona was found nursing a set of three young Chihuahua puppies in a box . Incredibly, one of the cats was found nursing a set of three young Chihuahua puppies. What happened to the Chihuahua's mother is not yet known. 'At least the cat was saving some animals,' said Sheriff Joe Arpaio in a press statement, 'I wont say the same thing for this guy.' Another cat in the video appeared to have a serious injury to its left eye while the body of a further feline was also discovered at the home.

"A young mother is desperately trying to raise money for an expensive cancer treatment which could buy her more time with her family. Louisa Steckenreuter, 35, a mother to two young children,  Darcy, 13, and  Tilda, 2, was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma, a rare form of cancer last year. Now to have a chance at accessing potentially life-saving treatment the woman from Dulwich Hill, in Sydney's inner-west, needs to raise $100,000. 'What we’re hoping is that it gives me longer to spend time with my kids and watch them grow up.

'I was diagnosed on the 23rd of June last year,' Ms Steckenreuter told Daily Mail Australia. 'I had pain my shoulder, I sort of regularly had muscle pain in my neck and shoulder anyway but then it just got incredibly intense and for a while they thought it was something called a shoulder impingement,' she continued. 'Then they did an x-ray and saw that the bone was very unhealthy and they did a biopsy and found out it was cancer.' Since then the mother-of-two has undergone eight rounds of intravenous chemotherapy, which while it helped also made her very unwell. 'My oncologist has recommended I try this new drug. It’s called Keytruda', Ms Steckenreuter said. It works differently to chemotherapy, which attacks all the cells in the system, even healthy ones.

The mum-of-two was diagnosed after she went in for an x-ray on a sore shoulder . 'I was diagnosed on the 23rd of June last year,' Ms Steckenreuter told Daily Mail Australia . 'Whereas the Keytruda works with your body’s immune system and recognises the fact that the body’s immune system is able to fight the cancer cells if they realise the cells are bad,' Ms Steckenreuter explained. However the drawback is the medication costs $6000 a month, and is not subsidised on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is usually used to treat patients with advanced melanomas. Since the diagnosis she has undergone eight rounds of intravenous chemotherapy, which while it helped also made her very unwell . Ms Steckenreuter turned to a new drug, Keytruda, to help fight off the deadly disease. Her doctors believe it may help her . Ms Steckenreuter said her oncologist, Professor David Thomas, said he believes the treatment might work for her, and others in a similar situation . 'The reason he thinks it will work is that sarcoma and melanoma cancer cells are built in a similar way and respond in a similar way,' she said. 'What we’re hoping is that it gives me longer to spend time with my kids and watch them grow up. 'And grow old with husband like we had planned,' Ms Steckenreuter said.

Just before speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Sunday, an anonymous donor had pledged $10,000 to Ms Steckenreuter's cause. She broke down in tears when told about the donation, and vowed to find out who the generous person was so she could thank them. The Sydney woman isn't quite halfway to her $100,000 target and has so far raised $48,670, but needs more so she can try this drug which has a good chance of buying her more time.

"Two men accused of setting up a stall on London's Oxford Street and handing out ISIS propaganda leaflets to shoppers have pleaded not guilty to terror offences. Shah Jahah Khan, 62, and Muslim convert Ibrahim Anderson, 38, both from Luton, each deny one charge of inviting support for a banned organisation. Anderson appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court wearing dark grey Islamic dress with a grey cardigan, while elderly-looking Khan appeared with a long white beard and light blue Islamic dress. Ibrahim Anderson, left, and Shah Jahah Khan, who have both pleaded guilty to terror offences today at Westminister Magistrates Court . The court heard that the charge relates to an offence on August 9 last year, when the pair are alleged to have handed out leaflets about ISIS on the busy shopping street. Anderson also denied one charge of possessing information likely to be useful for the preparation of or carrying out an act of terrorism, when police searched his property in December last year. Prosecutor Adam Harbinson told the court: 'On the August 9 last year a group of around six men erected a stall near Oxford Street. 'There were leaflets being handed out by the people running that stall. It is alleged that Anderson and Khan were two people assisting in the running of that stall and they were both taking part in handing out the leaflets. The court heard that the charge relates to an offence on August 9 last year, when the pair are alleged to have handed out leaflets about ISIS on the busy shopping street, pictured . Khan, left, and Anderson are accused of setting up a stall on London's Oxford Street and handing out leaflets inviting shoppers to join ISIS . 'Although the leaflet doesn't mention ISIS in Iraq or Syria, an expert in Islamic studies has concluded the only circumstances the leaflets could possibly be making reference to are the declaration by ISIS and its leader of the establishment of an Islamic State last summer. 'The leaflet sets out that Muslims have a duty to further the causes of the caliphate. 'One of the men was challenged by members of the public as to why he was handing out leaflets calling for support of this organisation. The court heard how the leaflets handed out related to ISIS.  Pictured are members loyal to ISIS waving the group's flag in Raqqa, Syria . 'He responded by saying in general terms that non-believers, or Kafirs, should be killed.' Anderson and Khan remained standing throughout the hearing, 'in accordance with their religious beliefs', defence counsel Tony Lodge said. Senior district judge Howard Riddle granted the two men conditional bail and they will appear at the Old Bailey on May 15.

"A violent thug who went on the run before taunting police by posing on Facebook in a silver wig and Dame Edna Everage-style sunglasses has been jailed for a second time. Michael Easy, 29, from Southampton, Hampshire, sparked a nationwide police manhunt after going on the run in 2013 after attacking a woman at a party. While on the run, he posted photographs of himself on Facebook posing in a platinum wig and pink Dame Edna Everage-style glasses under the profile name of Michelle. The image showed him pressing his finger to his lips - taunting police as they had failed to track him down. Michael Easy, 29, from Southampton, Hampshire (pictured), sparked a major police manhunt after going on the run and taunted police by posing in Dame Edna-style glasses and a platinum wig in Facebook photos . Easy posted the photograph of himself in a wig and pink sunglasses under the Facebook name 'Michelle Dirt' However, officers eventually found him and he was jailed for 15 months - but he went on the run again in December last year upon his release. Officers arrested him once again and he is now facing the next four months in jail for breaching a restraining order and assaulting two prison officers during his first stint behind bars. The court heard Easy breached the restraining order when he was seen leaving a party with his former girlfriend, aged 19, in December last year. Her family called the police because they were concerned for her safety as Easy had been found guilty in January 2013 of assaulting her when she was pregnant with his child - although in court Easy disputed the child, who is now in care, was his. Southampton Magistrates' Court heard he was due in court for a trial concerning these charges in February, but failed to appear. He was convicted in his absence and a police manhunt was launched. He was found nine days later. Mark Florida-James, defending Easy for his latest crimes, told the court that his former girlfriend had told him she thought the restraining order was over and that she obliged in leaving the party with him. Easy (pictured) is now facing four months in jail after breaching a restraining order and assaulting two prison guards while at Winchester Prison . The crown applied for a new order to be imposed, with prosecuting solicitor Louise Holmes telling the hearing that Easy's former girlfriend, who cannot be named, is 'extremely vulnerable' and has learning difficulties. Ms Holmes said: 'Mr Easy's history and his previous convictions clearly show he is a man of violence towards women and his partners.' The court was handed a statement from Easy's former partner asking not to impose the restraining order, but Ms Holmes told the court that police believed she did this because she is worried for her safety. District Judge Anthony Callaway refused to impose another restraining order, telling the court the woman concerned is an adult who can make her own decisions. The court also heard how Easy assaulted two male prison officers at Winchester Prison in November last year after they tried to take him back to his cell when he became argumentative and disruptive. Easy - a serial offender who has more than 27 convictions to his name - found himself behind bars for 15 months after kicking and slapping his former girlfriend at a party. During his time in prison, he struck a guard in the face, causing swelling to his cheek, after being told to stop jumping on the net installed between prison floors to prevent suicides. In another incident, he also struck another prison officer in the face, causing facial swelling and a shoulder injury which required treatment. Mr Florida-James said: 'Mr Easy seems to attract trouble, he causes trouble, he admits that. 'He's now quite keen to have some sort of diagnosis to try to help him with these problems.' Judge Callaway sentenced Easy to 56 days for the 'serious' breach of the restraining order and a total of 56 days for assaulting the prison officers, to run consecutively. He gave no sentence for failing to surrender.","Michael Easy first went on the run in 2013 after assaulting a woman at party .

"The Florida mailman who caused a major security scare when he landed his gyro-copter on the US Capitol lawn on Wednesday afternoon was just seconds from being shot out of the sky. House Homeland Security panel Chairman Michael McCaul revealed that Capitol authorities had Doug Hughes, 61, in their sights and were prepared to open fire. 'Had it gotten any closer to the speaker's balcony they have long guns to take it down, but it didn't. It landed right in front,' McCaul said about the flight which was undetected until authorities actually saw the craft approach. However, Hughes claims he informed the Secret Service and Capitol police of his potentially lethal stunt into the no-fly zone, which was designed to draw attention to campaign finance reform and government corruption. Speaking prior to the flight and just days after a man shot himself dead in front of the Capitol on Saturday causing panic, Hughes appeared confident he would survive his 'insane' protest. 'I don't believe that the authorities are going to shoot down a 61-year-old mailman in a flying bicycle,' said Hughes of the latest embarrassment for White House and Capitol security. Indeed, NORAD reported that they did not scramble any assets and were not informed of the flight until it had landed. And local Washington D.C. response helicopter units designed to deal with slow moving targets admitted they did not react either. Scroll Down for Video .

Practice: According to the Tampa Bay Times Mr. Hughes (pictured here on a practice run in Florida) has been planning his Capitol building landing for two years . Protest flight: Doug Hughes took off from an undisclosed location in Washington D.C. and landed his gyro-copter on the West Front lawn of the US Capitol building . Campaign for change: In these April, 2015, photos, Doug Hughes puts address labels on half of the 535 letters to Congress that he intended to deliver via gyro-copter at his home in Ruskin . Doug Hughes' close friend Mike Shanahan, said today that the Hughes is not a terrorist and did not mean any harm with his protest. 'I was scared to death they were going to kill him,' Shanahan said to the Tampa Bay Times. 'My thanks goes out to whomever it was who decided not to pull the trigger.' The mailman's flight to raise awareness for campaign finance reform and donation caps caused the Capitol to go into lockdown as stunned members of the public watched him land his single-seat gyro-copter around 2pm and breach the No-Fly 'P56-Zone'. 'He has no weapons or anything else,' said Michael Shanahan to CNN. 'I know him personally. He's like a pitbull when he has an idea. He wants to wake up the country.' Hughes, who has been planning his 'insane' D.C. flight for two years was promptly arrested by police and FBI teams moved in quickly afterwards with bomb disposal robots. Capitol Police didn't immediately identify the pilot or comment on his motive, but a Florida postal carrier named Doug Hughes took responsibility for the stunt on a website where he said he was delivering letters to all 535 members of Congress in order to draw attention to campaign finance corruption. 'As I have informed the authorities, I have no violent inclinations or intent,' Hughes wrote on his website, thedemocracyclub.org. 'An ultralight aircraft poses no major physical threat - it may present a political threat to graft. I hope so. There's no need to worry - I'm just delivering the mail.'

Resting: The gyro-copter sits on the West Front lawn with emergency vehicles surrounding it after it came down on Wednesday afternoon . Furious interest: Members of the media converge near Constitution Avenue on Capitol Hill in Washington . Evidence: The illegally landed craft  was piloted by Florida mailman Doug Hughes to protest against government corruption and to promote campaign finance reform . Embarrassment: A gyro copter that was flown onto the grounds of the U.S. Capitol is seen on the west front lawn in Washington . Witnesses said the craft approached the Capitol from the west, flying low over the National Mall and the Capitol reflecting pool across the street from the building. It barely cleared a row of trees and a statue of Gen. Ulysses Grant. John Jewell, 72, a tourist from Statesville, North Carolina, said the craft landed hard and bounced. An officer was already there with a gun drawn. 'He didn't get out until police officers told him to get out. He had his hands up'' and was quickly led away by the police, Jewell said. 'They snatched him pretty fast.' Elizabeth Bevins, a tourist from Atlanta, said she was standing across the street from the Capitol when the helicopter flew in around 20 or 30 feet high, and it 'just sort of plopped down on the lawn.' Downtown Washington is blanketed by restrictions on air traffic that generally prohibit aircraft from flying over the White House, the Capitol, the national Mall and key buildings without special permission. The Federal Aviation Administration said the pilot hadn't notified it of his plans to enter restricted airspace. The situation was under investigation and streets in the area were shut down. Emergency vehicles were dispatched to the area and a robot bomb detector was sent over to the craft. Amid the commotion, the small craft presented a strange sight sitting on the green lawn of the Capitol, its rotors slowly spinning. Landed: The gyro-copter sits on the West Lawn after it came to a halt having defied the no-fly zone over the US Capitol and White House . According to the Tampa Bay Times, 61-year-old Doug Hughes has been planning the stunt for two years saying, 'No sane person would do what I'm doing.' In a report published by the newspaper prior to this afternoon's unauthorized landing, Hughes said, 'I have got a plane, a gyro-plane. And I'm going to fly it, I'm going to violate the no-fly zone, non-violently,' he says in the video posted to the newspapers website. 'I'm going to land on the Capitol Mall.' Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times prior to his flight, Hughes said that he had phoned the Secret Service to tell them he would land in front of the Capitol and that he had emailed Barack Obama's public email too. He said that he flight would serve as a protest against rampant lobby and interest groups controlling the political process and a wake-up call for security. 'Again, I'm going to fly low and slow and these guys are going to have a full head of adrenaline. Eventually, I'm hoping the Blackhawk will catch up with me about the time that the authorities realize that I'm not a threat and knocking me down is not a politically savvy move, and I anticipate having an escort all the way in. I'm hoping for a friendly escort.' Recovery: Various officials take a close up look at the scene where a small gyro-copter landed on the US Capitol lawn . Authorities load the gyro-copter onto the back of a truck to remove it from the West Front of the US Capitol . Retrieval: People walk past the gyro-copter that was flown onto the grounds of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday . While he got no escort and the authorities were not aware of his incoming flight, Hughes is aware of what the consequences will now be. He anticipates losing his job with the US Postal Service and expects to lose his freedom. He admits to not telling his Russian-born wife or his four living children for fear they would be implicated. At the bottom line of his protest is his belief that money has corrupted democracy. 'We're heading full-throttle toward a breakdown,' he said to the Tampa Bay Times. 'There's no question that we need government, but we don't have to accept that it's a corrupt government that sells out to the highest bidder. We can have a government that works for the people, that answers to the people, that can only take money from the people in small amounts.' Hughes became politically radicalized two-and-a-half years ago when his 24-year-old son from a previous marriage committed suicide by driving his car head-on into another car - killing the driver. Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times, Hughes says that 'something changed in me' and that he realized he had to commit to making a change in this world. He hit upon his daring gyro-copter plan and set up a website and began to email every TV station and newspaper he could. He also told the Secret Service. Indeed, Hughes claims an agent came to see him last spring to ask him about his stunt and left him his card. Before he set off today, Hughes told the Times, 'I have thought about walking away from this whole thing because it's crazy,' he said. 'But I have also thought about being 80 years old and watching the collapse of this country and thinking that I had an idea once that might have arrested the fall and I didn't do it. 'And I will tell you completely honestly: I'd rather die in the flight than live to be 80 years old and see this country fall.'","Florida mailman breaches no-fly zone and lands gyro-copter on US Capitol West Front Lawn .

"Restaurant critic and festival curator Leo Schofield, 79, claimed living in Tasmania was the unhappiest time of his life . An Australian festival organiser has slammed Tasmania as a state full 'dregs, bogans and third-generation morons'. In a scathing article, long time restaurant critic and festival curator Leo Schofield, 79, claimed living in Tasmania was the unhappiest time of his life and the decade he spent there left him feeling bitter and depressed. 'I think I came very close to either a nervous breakdown or suicide. I just started to fall apart,' he told Fairfax. Mr Schofield moved to Hobart to set up a Baroque music festival in what he claims was an attempt to help Tasmanians take advantage of its grand heritage. He decided to relocate back to New South Wales after the Tasmanian Government cut the festivals funding by 25 per cent. Mr Schofield said he was offered $300,000 for the 2014 festival which was a reduction from the $400,000 the government offered in the previous year. 'We were deeply wounded and shocked,' he said. '[The festival] was supported by a lot of wonderful people down there, who shared the vision that the government wouldn't. Anyhow, we threw up our hands and said, 'We're not going to do it anymore. F**k you.' Mr Schofield moved to Hobart to set up a Baroque music festival, but decided to relocate back to New South Wales after the Tasmanian Government cut the festivals funding by 25 per cent . After receiving an offer from Queensland arts organisations he decided to move the festival to Brisbane. Mr Schofield said his daughters recognised that the battle he was waging with the Tasmanian Government took a toll on him and decided to stage an 'intervention'. 'The whole process knocked me about terribly and I honestly started going to pieces,' he said. 'I was drinking, I was taking a lot of tablets, and stupidly driving when I was in no condition to drive. I was suffering from acute depression.' While Mr Schofield admits he was 'absolutely obsessed, tremendously intrigued' by Tasmania, he continued to blast Tasmanian's for wanting to 'dig it up, chop it down, sell it to the Chinese.' Luke Martin from the Tourism Industry Council of Tasmania Tweeted the above after Mr Schofield said of Tasmania: 'All the young people leave, and the only ones left are the dregs, the bogans, the third-generation morons' He added the above despite Mr Schofield saying he suffered from acute depression after the mishap . He continued: 'All the young people leave, and the only ones left are the dregs, the bogans, the third-generation morons'. He said he plans to reserve a chapter in his memoirs dedicated to his time in Tasmania called 'Revenge of the Bogans'. Luke Martin from the Tourism Industry Council of Tasmania responded to Mr Schofield's comments labelling them as 'blatant mistruths'. He tweeted: 'No one cut his funding, he asked for more and spat the dummy when it wasn't given'.","Restaurant critic and festival curator Leo Schofield said living in Tasmania was the unhappiest time of his life .

"Hillary Clinton embraced the federal recognition of same-sex marriage today, saying through a spokesperson she believes it should be a 'constitutional right.' The former Obama administration official endorsed gay marriage in 2013 after she left the State Department, saying she 'was fully in support of gay marriage and that it is now continuing to proceed state-by-state.' And in a terse interview with NPR last year in which she declined to go into detail about her views on the topic, she repeated that position. Now a presidential candidate, Clinton today gave same-sex marriage her complete backing ahead of the presentation later this month of oral arguments in several cases before the Supreme Court on the matter. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Now a presidential candidate, Clinton today gave same-sex marriage her complete backing. Her shift in position comes just before the presentation later this month of oral arguments in several cases before the Supreme Court on the matter . Clinton had brought attention to the issue with her campaign launch video on Sunday that featured 'everyday' Americans preparing for something big - including a gay couple planning their wedding . 'Hillary Clinton supports marriage equality and hopes the Supreme Court will come down on the side of same-sex couples being guaranteed that constitutional right,' Clinton spokeswoman Adrienne Elrod told a leading gay news publication, The Washington Blade. The shift puts Clinton's views in line with the Obama administration's Justice Department, which in January 'committed to ensuring that the benefits of marriage are available as broadly as possible.' Attorney General Eric Holder at that time said his department would file friend of the court briefs that 'urge the Supreme Court to make marriage equality a reality for all Americans.' 'It is time for our nation to take another critical step forward to ensure the fundamental equality of all Americans—no matter who they are, where they come from, or whom they love,' Holder said. Buzzfeed News earlier this week reported that the newly announced candidate's campaign had not responded to its requests for comment on the status of her views on marriage. Clinton had brought attention to the issue with her campaign launch video on Sunday that featured 'everyday' Americans preparing for something big - including a gay couple planning their wedding. The video also included an image a same-sex female couple snuggling on the couch as Clinton discussed families in a voice over. But it was only after fellow presidential contender Marco Rubio began taking flak for telling CNN on Tuesday that he believes that states should continue to have the final say on legalization of gay marriage that a staffer for the Democratic front-runner publicly announced Clinton no longer supports states' rights when it comes to same-sex marriage. 'Marriage laws have always been defined by the states,' Rubio had told CNN host Jake Tapper. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during a roundtable discussion with members of the small business community at Capital City Fruit today in Norwalk, Iowa. Clinton is campaigning in the Hawkeye State this week as she makes her second bid for President of the United States . It was only after fellow presidential contender Marco Rubio, pictured here at his campaign launch on Monday, began taking flak for telling CNN that he believes that states should continue to have the final say on legalization of gay marriage that a staffer for the Democratic front-runner publicly announced that Clinton no longer supports states' rights when it comes to same-sex marriage . He added, 'I think there's still a significant number of Americans that believe that the definition of marriage should be that of one man and one woman, as it has been for thousands of years.' Tapper argued that 'they are a minority,' leading the Republican senator to contend that 'they're a large minority.' 'In essence, there are still parts of this country that believe that way,' he said. The exchange had started with Tapper accusing of Rubio of pigeonholing Clinton with his claims that she's a leader of 'yesterday' when he's the one who doesn't support same-sex marriage. 'You are casting yourself as a candidate of a new generation. But there is an issue where you are very out of step with younger voters, even younger Republican voters,' he said. 'On that issue, same-sex marriage, senator, you're the candidate of yesterday.' Rubio later said during the interview that the United States is a republic and anyone who want to see marriage laws amended should lobby their state legislature, not the federal government. 'I don’t believe the court system is the appropriate way to do it, and I don’t believe Washington and the Supreme Court is the appropriate way to do it,' he said. The nation's highest court will hear arguments on April 28 in gay marriage cases originating out of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. A group of 57 members of Congress earlier this month filed a friend of the court briefing asking the high court not to side with gay marriage proponents, saying, 'The relative novelty of same-sex marriage weighs against the mandatory redefinition of marriage.' Rubio was not among the signatories but GOP presidential candidate and Texas Senator Ted Cruz was. Republican Senator Rand Paul, the only other major politician to formally enter the race, also did not sign the letter.","Clinton endorsed gay marriage in 2013; said she 'was fully in support of gay marriage and that it is now continuing to proceed state-by-state'

"A Utah man is thankful he is alive after he claims a Delta Airlines plane flew over his home when a large chunk of ice dropped from the aircraft shattering his car's windshield. Todd Larson, 55, told Daily Mail Online he had parked his collectible Dodge Challenger worth $30,000 in the driveway of his Taylorsville home on March 25 when moments later an ice chunk crashed onto his car at 1.53am. 'It hit so hard that four or five neighbors' car alarms went off,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'It missed going through my roof by only inches and if I had stayed in the car and answered by son’s message about picking him up, that piece of ice would have gone right through my chest.' Todd Larson said a chunk of ice fell from a plan smashing through the windshield of his Dodge Challenger parked at his Taylorsville, Utah home (above his damaged Dodge Challenger) He said the FAA did an investigation and found an A1 aircraft that matched within two minutes of the time the incident happened and when the plane was flying above his home . Mr Larson said two minutes later at 1.55am he called police to file the report of the ice chunk falling through his car's windshield, which he believes came from a Delta Airlines A1 aircraft. He earlier told Fox 13 there were four Delta Air Line flights in the area when the incident occurred, according to a representative for the Federal Aviation Administration. On Friday afternoon, Mr Larson told Daily Mail Online that the FAA did an investigation and learned that on March 26 an aircraft within two minutes of the time of incident was in the area above his home. 'The investigator cannot give me the flight number but the time it happened matched within two minutes that the plane was overhead,' he said. 'What caught my attention was that as he turned the plane and put his spoiler down, you could hear the engine change, and I looked up and saw that it was a Delta plane. 'Then I heard a huge crash which sounded like a major car accident.' Mr Larson said the hole in his windshield is about 12.5 inches in length and that the size of the piece of ice that went through was the size of a cinder block. 'The pieces that broke up were the size of a grapefruit and the smaller ones were the size of golf balls,' he told Daily Mail Online. Mr Larson has already paid the $4,000 in repairs which included $400 for the windshield and additional costs for replacing his Bluetooth, emergency phone and electric power seat with a heater that were all damaged in the incident. 'When you’re retired and you have to take that big chunk of money out it makes a big difference in what you can do,' he said. 'You try and stay on a budget and you find a car that you really wanted and it’s damaged in this way. 'My insurance says yes they’ll fix it, but my agent explained to me what happens and told me to call FAA, and said if I didn’t make a claim my car would be worthless so I’m at Catch-22. 'I don’t know why they can’t admit what they did.' Mr Larson said the chunks of ice ranged in size from grapefruits to golf balls (above the chunks of ice following the incident) He said the hole in his windshield is about 12.5 inches in length and that the glass was shattered into a fine powder . Mr Larson said that he has contacted Delta Airlines and the person in charge of the aircraft has not returned his calls. He said they are meant to respond within ten working days, and that after giving them 15, he is left fed up. 'They don’t want to recognize it as their mistake that something happened from their plane,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'One of the people who did the preliminary investigation explained that if it was a part or a panel they are responsible, but ice is an ""act of God"" or cause of nature. 'I said it could be a malfunction in the plane and they won’t recognize that or give me a call back. 'I want them to admit that it was their fault.' Daily Mail Online calls to Delta Airlines on Friday were not immediately returned. Mr Larson said he wants Delta Airlines to admit the chunk of ice came from their aircraft. On Friday, he told Daily Mail Online he had not had calls returned from the person in charge of the airbus . An incident similar to Larson's occurred earlier this year, when large pieces of ice slammed down into a man's Chicago living room and bedroom, causing destruction including a massive hole in his ceiling. John Connors said apart from his cat Oscar being left scared, who was uninjured during the incident in January, if he had been home he would have been killed. 'I walked in and it looked like a bomb had exploded up in here,' Connors told WLS. At the time, pilot Scott Batzel told Lake View Patch that he thought the ice dropped through Connors' apartment because of a plane flying overhead. Batzel said: 'There’s a slight possibility the ice-ball fell from an airplane. It’s not a common occurrence but it does happen from time to time. 'It’s very likely that many arriving airplanes were operating in that vicinity.' He added: 'Some airplanes use potable water to flush the lavatory toilets. 'Normally the flushed waste is collected in a storage tank but if the tank was leaking, ice could have built up on the outside of the plane and eventually broke free.' In January, John Connors (pictured above with his cat Oscar) experienced a similar incident when ice pummeled through his Chicago apartment leaving his cat Oscar scared  and a massive hole in his ceiling .","Todd Larson, 55, of Taylorsville, Utah claims Delta A1 aircraft flew over his home dropping ice chunk smashing his Dodge Challenger's windshield .

"An advanced spacecraft flies up to an orbiting space station, taking with it cargo and supplies for the crew on board as they continue their mission in the final frontier. No, this isn’t a scene from Star Trek - it’s an event that took place in Earth’s orbit just the other day. And to celebrate the arrival of the cargo-carrying Dragon spacecraft, one astronaut on the ISS donned a uniform from the popular TV show. Scroll down for video . Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti wore the uniform on Friday (shown). Together with Nasa astronaut Terry Virts she captured the spacecraft. On board it had 4,000lbs of supplies - including a coffee machine. It will remain at the ISS for a month before returning to Earth . Italian Esa astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti revealed her unique attire in a tweet. ‘”There’s coffee in that nebula”… ehm, I mean… in that #Dragon,’ she wrote. Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. The ‘Dragon’ she was referring to was SpaceX’s vehicle, which launched from Cape Canaveral on Tuesday 14 April, arriving at the station on 17 April. Here it was ‘berthed’ to the ISS - which means it was grabbed by an arm on the station, and did not dock by itself. The capture occured while the ISS was over the Pacific Ocean, just east of Japan. With the assistance of Expedition 43 Commander Terry Virts of Nasa, Cristoforetti successfully captured the spacecraft at 9.15am last Friday. Spacecraft like Dragon are used to keep the ISS stocked with supplies, but this mission carried with it a treat for the astronauts - a coffee machine called the ISSPresso. Italian coffee giant Lavazza joined forces with the Turin-based engineering company Argotec and the Italian Space Agency to provide a specially designed machine for use off the planet. Nasa certified its safety. It is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity on the ISS, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth. It uses a 'capsule system' to fill plastic pouches with espresso and other hot drinks such as tea. The machine can also be used to rehydrate food.

The Canadarm 2 reaches out to capture the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft and prepare it to be pulled into its port on the International Space Station on Friday 17 April. The Canadarm2 robotic arm  maneuvered Dragon to its installation position at the Earth-facing port of the Harmony module . ‘It's been just amazing,’ Cristoforetti said after snaring the Dragon over the Pacific. ‘Lots of science and even coffee's in there, so that's pretty exciting.’ Within two and half hours of its capture, the Dragon was bolted securely to the space station. This is the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. Aside from the coffee machine, the SpaceX Dragon supply ship had in total 4,000 pounds of food, science research and other equipment . The espresso machine is three months late because of the backlog created by last year's loss of a supply ship in a launch explosion. Much later and the espresso machine would have missed Cristoforetti, who returns home next month. The Dragon will remain at the orbiting lab until around 21 May, when it will be released full of experiments and discarded equipment for return to Earth. It's the only supply ship capable of bringing items back. Among the newly arrived research are experiments for American astronaut Scott Kelly, who is just a few weeks into a one-year mission, which will be a record for Nasa. Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko also will remain on board until March 2016. Within 2.5 hours of its capture, the Dragon was bolted securely to the space station, shown. This is the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral . The capture happened while the ISS was over the Pacific Ocean, just east of Japan, shown in this image . The successful launch of the Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dragon took place on 14 April from Florida under perfect conditions, after an attempt had to be scrubbed on Monday due to lightning . SpaceX, meanwhile, released a video showing its first-stage booster landing on an ocean platform shortly after Tuesday's lift-off, then tipping over in flames. It was the California company's third attempt to fly a booster rocket to the platform stationed off Florida's northeastern coast. SpaceX chief Elon Musk said the platform - dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions' - endured just minor damage. The next attempt will be in June on the next SpaceX supply run for Nasa. Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur who also runs the Tesla electric car maker, wants to reuse his rockets to bring down the cost of spaceflight. After the launch, SpaceX attempted to land part of its rocket booster on a floating platform for the third time. The landing was partially successful, with the rocket touching down on the barge - before it tipped over and exploded. The mission bodes well for the future of reusable rockets, though .","Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti wore the uniform on Friday .

"The eight-year-old girl who died in a horrific accident in New South Wales has been identified as a nine-year-old boy continues to fight for his life following the two-car collision on New South Wales' Central Coast. The young girl has been named as Piper by 9News and was in the car with her mother, Chantelle Boddy, and two brothers when it is believed their Holden Astra aqua-planed, spun out of control and ended up on the other side of the road. Piper's grandmother, Helen Boddy, was also in the vehicle at the time of the accident on Wyee Road near Doyalson about 5.15pm on Saturday. Scroll down for video . The eight-year-old girl who died in a horrific accident near Doyalson in NSW Central Coast has been identified as Piper (pictured) She was travelling with her two brothers (pictured), her mother and grandmother when the accident happened . The incident also left passengers in the ute that collided with the Astra with severe injuries. Warwick Milham arrived at the scene after hearing his wife, Glenda, and daughter, Michelle, were involved in the crash. Glenda suffered a fractured neck while Michelle had broken bones. 'It was a horrendous scene. I wouldn't wish it upon anybody,' Mr Milham told 9News. With the crash claiming Piper's life, the national Easter long weekend death toll now stands at 10. In pictures, the eight-year-old appears to be a happy child, smiling in her blue and white school uniform. The seven people involved in the crash were all trapped in the wreckage before being released from the two vehicles by emergency services. Two boys, aged nine and 12, were airlifted to The Children's Hospital at Westmead.

The younger boy remains in a critical condition while the older boy is now stable. A 54-year-old woman was the driver of the car, with a 31-year-old woman the front-seat passenger. A 32-year-old woman was driving the ute, with a 61-year-old woman in the front-passenger seat. All women sustained fractures in the crash and were taken to John Hunter Hospital. They are reported to be in a stable condition. Wyee Road was closed for seven hours while Crash Investigation Unit police examined the scene. 'When you get behind the wheel you accept the risks that go with it and that includes the real possibility you will change your family's life or that of another family forever.' 'As wet weather is expected to continue across the remainder of Easter – I am urging all road users to slow down, adjust to the conditions and leave more room than usual between your vehicle and the one in front of you,' Assistant Commissioner Hartley said. It follows the death of a two-year-old girl on Friday when a ute rolled over in South Australia. A 33-year-old man died in another rollover incident in Western Australia the same day. A couple and their two young children also narrowly avoided an Easter tragedy after a head-on crash with an allegedly drunk driver in NSW's Hawkesbury region. A 29-year-old Stanhope Gardens man was travelling with his wife, two-year-old son and one-month-old daughter, when the crash happened in Webb's Creek on Friday afternoon. All four were uninjured, but all the airbags in the car deployed in the crash. The driver of the second car, a 54-year-old Lower Portland man who was also not hurt, returned a positive reading of 0.120. The man was later charged with mid-range drink-driving and driving an unregistered vehicle. He was issued a field court attendance notice to appear before Windsor Local Court on May 14.

"Nigel Jackson, 59, a British expat accused of murdering his wife in Portugal has written a letter for jail explaining how he believes she died . A British expat accused of murdering his wife in Portugal has admitted burying her body in the garden but denies killing her, claiming she must have died during a bungled burglary. Nigel Jackson, 59, was arrested at his country home in Alvor, near Portimao in the Algarve, in January, after the body of his wife Brenda Davidson, 72, was found in a shallow grave outside. At the time Jackson claimed Mrs Davidson committed suicide after being diagnosed with ovarian and thyroid cancer. But after being shown evidence she was killed, he had now changed his story. In a letter from jail entitled 'LOVE, CARE DEVOTION AND BETRAYAL', seen by the Daily Mirror, Jackson said Mrs Davidson must have been killed by intruders. However, he sticks to the rest of his original story, saying he buried her in his garden with their beloved pets, which they called 'babies', because he thought it's what she would have wanted. He wrote: 'As I thought it was her choice I honoured her choice that night to bury her with our babies. 'I told everyone she had gone away...this was the only lie I told and I could not live with this lie so I went to the consulate and asked them to get the police.' He described the moment he found his wife's body in a pool of blood, claiming to have held the corpse for hours begging her to wake up before discovering the knife and a wound on her neck. Jackson is accused of murdering his wife at his home in Alvor, in the Algarve (pictured). At the time he denied causing her death, saying she had killed herself, but now says she died during a burglary . He also admits to moving his mistress of three years into the house as Mrs Davidson's body lay in the garden, but said the affair was no secret. He maintains that after her cancer diagnosis his wife had acknowledged that he still had needs to fulfill, and had given her blessing, provided he didn't 'bring it home'. Jackson said he moved his partner into the house in an attempt to get over his wife's death, adding: 'I was trying to move on but I could not do so.' Jackson was initially arrested in January this year after Mrs Davidson's son Dean became concerned about her whereabouts. According to neighbours, Jackson had initially said she had returned to the UK 'for treatment for a nasty cough.' But when she failed to return to their home  Jackson then alerted the authorities and told them he was 'dedicated himself to trying to find her.' However her son eventually contacted police and Jackson was arrested at their home and questioned by police for several hours. Mrs Davidson's body was found in the garden of her home in Alvor (pictured), buried in shallow grave, while Jackson had moved his mistress into the main house . It was then that he revealed the location of the body of Mrs Davidson, his wife of 27 years. Police believe she died last November before the body was wrapped in plastic sheeting and placed underneath a concrete slab and bricks in the garden. The couple moved to the Algarve around 10 years ago from their home in Rochester, Kent and had built up a close set of friends in the close-knit village. They had apparently got bored of their life in Kent and Mr Jackson, a former taxi driver, and his wife, a retired cleaner, moved to Portugal for a change of scene.

"Taxpayers are having to find £11billion a year to top up the wages of millions of people working in supermarkets and other low paid jobs. The money, which amounts to a massive public subsidy for the companies involved, is paid to some 5.2million workers in the form of tax credits and other benefits. Campaigners say the figures shine a light on how companies making huge profits are relying on the taxpayer to ensure their staff have enough money to put food on the table. The total amount of benefits paid to staff at some companies exceeds what the firms pay in corporation tax, according to the study by Citizens UK. Critics have accused supermarkets of relying on benefits to ensure their staff earn enough to put food on the table without them having to raise wages . The charity is campaigning for the adoption of the Living Wage - £9.15 an hour in London and £7.85 for the rest of the UK - across both the public and private sector. It estimates this would reduce the need for in-work benefits by £6.7bn a year, which would make a massive dent in the £12billion reduction in welfare spending which the Conservatives say is necessary. The current minimum wage for those over 21 is £6.50 an hour and will rise to £6.70 in October, but this is well below what the Government accepts is needed by many people, particularly those with children, to make ends meet. The charity’s report complains: ‘The public subsidy enables profitable businesses to get away with paying low wages.’ Its report says Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s posted combined profits of £3.9bn last year, but between them cost the taxpayer more than £750m in benefits paid to their staff. Tesco paid £519m in tax but received £364m in public subsidy for its 209,000 low-paid workers. Asda spent £150m in tax but its 120,000 low-paid workers received £221m in benefits. Morrisons’ tax bill was £62m while its 83,000 low-paid workers received £190m in benefits and Sainsbury’s paid £180m in tax, almost exactly as much as its low-paid staff received from the public purse. Of all the profitable companies examined by the charity, Next had the highest average subsidy of £2,087 per head given its high proportion of young employees who are typically paid just above the minimum wage of £6.70 an hour. Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an ‘invention’ Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an ‘invention’. He argued that pushing up wages will block recruitment. ‘For very many people, the retail sector provides useful income and Next has 30 applications for every vacancy. Raising wages too fast will simply reduce employment opportunities,’ he said. Other firms who rely on the taxpayer to top up staff wages include Amazon, fast food outlets and local authorities, where cleaning and care workers, for example, are already paid by the taxpayer. Paul Regan, chairman of Citizens UK, said: ‘The major retailers post profits and pay tax, but the Treasury has to step in and often pays out more than it gets in to help those workers for whom work does not pay.’ He called on the next government to show leadership ‘by implementing the living wage into all public sector commissioning’. The Rev Karen Rooms, Area Dean for Nottingham South and member of the Citizens UK Council, said: ‘The figures revealed by this research are shocking, as the true scale of the subsidy of big business becomes clear. ‘The huge profits made by some of these high street names are made off the back of poverty-wages. In some instances the amount of tax they pay doesn’t even cover the wage top-ups we all have to chip-in and help with through the Treasury. ‘At a time of austerity when all sectors of society have to make savings it seems obscene that big business isn’t playing its part to help the country recover.’ All of the main political parties support the living wage. Last week, David Cameron said businesses that can afford to pay it ‘should consider doing so’. Boris Johnson, the London mayor, said it was ‘madness’ that large employers paid chief executives huge salaries while their lowest-paid workers were subsidised by the taxpayer. Labour has made demands for employers to pay the Living Wage a major plank of its election strategy. However, the former Labour Cabinet minister Alan Milburn, chairman of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, said it could take 10 years to make the living wage a reality. He said: ‘Employers will have to pay more but wages cannot rise without improved productivity and more skills training. We will need a 10-year transition period to become a living wage country.’ Charles Cotton, of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, warned wage rises will hit employment, saying: ‘If employees weren’t getting subsidies, would firms employ as many people or would they cut back?’ Supermarkets said they paid above the minimum wage of £6.50 an hour for those aged over 21, regularly reviewed pay and gave employees benefits such as staff discounts. Asda, which is part of the US retail goliath Walmart, said pay and benefits ‘should be considered in the round’. In the USA, it is estimated that Walmart’s low-wage workers cost U.S. taxpayers an estimated $6.2 billion (£4.2bn) in public assistance including food stamps, Medicaid and subsidised housing. Morrisons said discounts and profit-sharing took the pay of many over the living wage. Sainsbury’s said it offered employees a discount card, annual bonus and paid breaks. Tesco said it paid, on average, 4-7per cent more than major competitors and had contributed £1.5bn in tax through business rates, employer national insurance and corporation tax in 2014. The British Retail Consortium said pay and benefits packages equated to an average of about £8.40 an hour and the industry had paid £19.5bn in ‘core business taxes’ last year.

"That little voice inside your head that tells you to keep eating is, in fact, simply a cluster of around 10,000 brain cells. Now scientists believe they have found tiny triggers inside those cells that give rise to this 'voice' and ruin a dieter's good intentions. The new research, done on fish and mice, could someday lead to pills that will be able to quieten that voice or increase its volume. The research focused on POMC neurons, which are a structure called the hypothalamus, that send and receive signals to regulate appetite. On the left, images of normal hypothalamus POMC cells from a developing mouse. On the right: when the gene for the transcription factor is deleted, the cells no longer make it . The research focused on POMC neurons, which are a structure called the hypothalamus, that send and receive signals to regulate appetite. When POMC neurons are absent, or not working properly, animals and humans grow dangerously obese. The new findings show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the POMC cells aren't working. The team, led by the University of Michigan, looked at how a protein called a transcription factor, and two small stretches of DNA called enhancers, act as triggers for the Pomc gene. All three regulate how often and when the POMC cells use the gene to create the signal molecules that then go out to the body. That little voice inside your head that tells you to keep eating is, in fact, simply a cluster of around 10,000 brain cells. Now scientists believe they have found tiny triggers inside those cells that give rise to this 'voice' 'The POMC region is a central node of the brain's means for regulating body weight, in response to influences from the hormone leptin,' said Malcom Low, a professor in the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology. Like signal lights that show pilots the path to an airport runway, enhancers guide proteins toward the gene so it can be read. Located deep inside the brain, in a structure called the hypothalamus, the cluster of POMC neurons act as a control center for feelings of fullness or hunger. They take in signals from the body, and send out chemical signals to regulate appetite and eating. When POMC neurons are absent, or not working correctly, animals and humans grow dangerously obese. The latest research show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the POMC cells aren't working. The researchers found that the two enhancers act in ways that complement one another, both encouraging the expression of the Pomc gene at key times. Mice born without both of them became obese – as if their Pomc gene had been deactivated. The protein that latches on to the enhancer, called a transcription factor, is also vital. In the new PNAS paper, the researchers report that the transcription factor Islet 1, encoded by the Isl1 gene, plays this important role for POMC. When the researchers blocked cells of the hypothalamus from making Islet 1 halfway through pregnancy, the fetal mice failed to develop any POMC cells. 'Taken together, this work represents the first example of a neuron-specific gene in vertebrates where we have found both the enhancers and a shared transcription factor that control gene expression in the developing brain and then throughout the life span of the adult,' says Low. Looking to see if the same factors do the same thing in humans will be more complex – and there may be other enhancers and transcription factors involved. But in theory, it could be possible to find drugs to increase the production of Pomc gene products, or to help silence it. 'For humans, Pomc regulation may be part of the equation of weight control,' says Low. 'We don't know, but we think it likely, that it may be similar to the mouse model, where its role is like a dial, with a linear relationship between the amount of Pomc expression and the degree of obesity.'","The research looked at POMC neurons that work toregulate appetite .

The property was built in 2004 by the owners of the next door home who needed a place to stay while their house was refurbished. They are now selling the log cabin as they no longer need it. Kesia Whitfield, from estate agents Symonds and Sampson, said: 'The Log Cabin is down an unmade track. It's a no through road so it's very quiet and the owner would have direct access to picturesque forest walks from there. 'What's special about this one is you can live in it 365 days a year. They've got planning permission to live there all year round, not just for holiday lets.'

According to property website Rightmove, the average price of a house in the New Forest is just shy of £370,000. The New Forest was created as a royal hunting enclave in 1079 when King William I, also known as William the Conquerer, wanted somewhere to hunt. Ten centuries on, the Forest is still largely in royal hands, with around 90 per cent of it belonging to the Crown. It became a National Park in 2005. The park, measuring 571 square kilometres, is set in a rough triangular shape across a large portion of Hampshire. It is bounded by Christchurch in the south west, Southampton in the east, and Fordingbridge and Redlynch in the north. A foal walking in the New Forest. The National Park in Hampshire is home to around 3,000 ponies . The forest is also famed for the New Forest pony, one of the recognised native breeds of the British Isles. There are estimated to be around 3,000 roaming the area. The countryside also boasts countless cycling and walking paths, as well as several decent museums and a host of famous country pubs. Bizarrely, the New Forest is also linked with one of Britain's most enduring mysteries. William Rufus, the Conqueror's son and successor, was shot and killed by a stray arrow while hunting in the Forest in 1100. Whether he was assassinated or  the victim of an accident remains a matter of debate.

The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend . It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring . Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat . In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud. In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also known as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

'We can't graduate enough engineers,' she said. Despite the recent news, in a survey of employers last fall by Michigan State University, the employment center found that hiring of graduates  will rise 16per cent this year.

The overall unemployment rate has fallen to 5.5per cent in March from 6.7per cent at the end of 2013. Apparently employers have more openings to fill because Baby Boomers are retiring and more workers are feeling confident enough about the economy to switch jobs. Overall, the United States generated 3.1 million jobs last year, the most since 1999. In particular, employer demand for so-called STEM graduates - in science, technology, engineering and mathematics - was highest.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg wants existing phone appointments extended so doctors can see patients on video calls . Mr Clegg today met patients and staff at Bodmin Community Hospital in Cornwall as he campaigned in the Lib Dem stronghold in the South West . But officials stressed that people would not be forced use the service and insisted it would only be for minor ailments or progress checks. They said it could be used for update appointments, brief progress checks or for when patients needed 'reassurance'. They pointed out many GPs surgeries already use phone appointments which video call services like Skype or FaceTime would improve. The Lib Dems also want repeat prescriptions and booking appointments to be made available online. The Liberal Democrat leader committed to using £250million from the sale of NHS assets deemed to be redundant to fund the use of technology in a drive to create a 'paperless health service' in England.

The Lib Dems said their plans would mean the ability to pay for five million more operations than the Conservatives, and allow them to hire 150,000 more nurses and 38,000 more GPs than Labour . Mr Clegg said: 'The NHS doesn't need warm words, it needs hard cash. And we know exactly how much because the boss of NHS England has told us - an extra GBP8 billion-a-year by 2020. 'The Liberal Democrats are the only party that has committed to finding that money and the only one that has set out how it will pay for it. 'But we also need to help the NHS adapt so it is fit for the challenges of the 21st century. 'That's why we have a plan to introduce modern technology that will help patients, with more doctors' appointments and repeat prescriptions at the touch of a button.' Mr Clegg, who was visiting Bodmin Community Hospital as part of his election tour, said: 'Both Ed Miliband and David Cameron have ignored the experts on this.

"Soloman Bygraves, who has been jailed for 30 months for mugging a pensioner by knocking him to the ground and taking his wallet . A thug has been jailed for mugging a frail pensioner who was knocked to the ground for £5 after he asked the courts to lock him up for a 'long time'. Solomon Bygraves, 29, was sentenced to 30 months in prison after admitting robbing 93-year-old Stanley Evans in the entrance to his block of flats in central London as he returned from a shopping trip. Shocking CCTV footage played at Southwark Crown Court, showed Bygraves following Mr Evans into the communal entrance of the flat. He offered to help the pensioner with his shopping, but instead snatched his wallet and knocked Mr Evans to the ground. The pensioner was then left lying in the entrance to the flats in Soho, central London for ten minutes after the attack on January 31. Today, the court heard how Bygraves, who at more than six foot, towered over his victim, targeted the elderly man because he was frail and old. In a victim impact statement, Mr Evans, said: 'I believe that the man who robbed me should be punished for attacking a 93 year-old pensioner. 'He should not abuse his strength. He tried to con me by offering to help me with my bags, I believe purely to get into the block of flats to rob me. 'I believe the public would be served for him to be in prison for a long time for his cowardly attack.' The pensioner described how he suffered an injury to his left shoulder and struggled to get up from the floor following the attack. He added: 'I was in pain for three weeks and am still suffering now. 'I was left on the floor after the robbery and couldn't get myself up for nearly ten minutes due to the pain and shock. Due to my age I found it very difficult to get up. 'I'm independently minded and determined not to allow this to change how I live or where or when I go out.' Bygraves, who is homeless and has 21 convictions for 49 offences, had his head in his hands as the sentencing hearing began. Southwark Crown Court was shown the moment pensioner Stanley Evans was targeted by Bygraves at the entrance to his flat in Soho, Central London . Richard Sedgwick, prosecuting, said Mr Evans was 92 at the time of the attack. He explained: 'Mr Bygraves is an exceedingly large man. There appears to be some evidence of targeting - the age and the size difference point to that. 'Mr Evans presents as an easy victim.' Outlining the attack, he added: 'Mr Evans is returning to his block of flats with his shopping. He is 92 years-old. 'The defendant follows him in behind him. There is a conversation. Mr Evans recalls it as being about visiting a friend inside the block of flats and helping him with his shopping. In a victim impact statement, Mr Evans, pictured, told the court that he wanted his attacker locked up for a long time to protect the public . 'Mr Evans then waits for a lift. The defendant returns, accosts him, takes Mr Evans' wallet from him causing Mr Evans to fall to the floor where he is unable to rise from for some time.' The pensioner eventually managed to get to his feet and return to his flat where he called 999. John Riley, for Bygraves, said the mugger had been recently diagnosed with a 'bi-polar condition' and was coming down from class A drugs when he assaulted Mr Evans. Bygraves also had 21 convictions for 49 offences, including three robberies and a history of drug misuse and mental health issues. He was also on bail for a 'domestic matter' in Norwich. But the judge, Recorder Andrew Mitchell QC, said Mr Evans could have died in the attack and ordered Bygraves to serve as minimum of 15 months. The judge told Bygraves, pictured, that Mr Evans could have easily died when he pushed him over for his wallet . He said: 'The victim in the case could easily have died, not through any other reason than just snatching something from him, and causing him therefore to fall down, and he could have just gone at that age. 'You followed him into the lobby where he was trying to get into the lift. You snatched from his pocket his wallet which contained between £5 and £10. As a result of you forcibly taking it from him he fell over. You knew he was falling over as you ran away, you left him on the ground. 'In his victim impact statement Mr Evans says he injured his shoulder when he fell on the floor and spent ten minutes in pain and shock which he found difficult to recover from. 'But he is a determined, independent man and he refuses to be affected by it. 'It may have been unplanned but it was opportunistic. You saw your victim and followed him in to somewhere where you had no right to be. The assault happened as the pensioner was waiting for a lift to his flat in Ingestre Court in central London . 'You pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and there is clear evidence of remorse. You have a drug addiction. You asked in your letter that you be spared jail but you described yourself it was a most horrible horrific and shameful crime. I am sure you know for this reason you have to go to jail.' Dressed in a blue hoodie and black trousers, the scruffily bearded Bygraves, of no fixed address, showed no emotion as he was taken away. The judge also praised Mr Evans and his comments in his victim impact statement. He added: 'This was a 92 year-old man going about his business. 'It was a remarkable victim impact statement. It is commendable, it shows a man of independence and maturity and understanding and appreciation.'","Solomon Bygraves admitted robbing 93-year-old Stanley Evans at his flat .

"Two men who became locked inside an airtight bank vault for six hours had to be dramatically rescued by firefighters using heavy drills. Jacob Church, 21, and Joe Tobin, 29, were at an art exhibition at a former bank building when the vault door shut behind them, leaving them trapped in total darkness. The pair - who had only met earlier that night - were fed water through a tube to prevent them becoming dehydrated while police kept in contact with them to check their oxygen levels were not getting dangerously low. After their six-hour ordeal, eventually fire crews with specialist drills were able to cut through the thick concrete walls. Trapped: Joe Tobin (left) and Jacob Church (right) pose for a selfie after getting trapped in the vault . Locked in: The pair - who only met earlier in the night - were shut inside the vault for almost six hours . Exhibition: The duo had attended the launch of the exhibition at the Abacus art space in Cardiff's Wood Street . Mr Church, who is from Taff's Well, has described the incident at the launch night of an exhibition at the Abacus art space in Cardiff's Wood Street as 'pretty nuts'. It was hosting the opening of the Look No Hands exhibition described by its curators as 'an eyeball massacre and a massage of visionary art.' One of the exhibition rooms was the 6m x 6m old bank vault with its thick metal door held ajar. The 21-year-old - who admits he was a 'little drunk' - went into the vault with fellow art enthusiast Mr Tobin at 1am. When he tried to close the door slightly, it shut fully and inadvertently activated the lock. He said: 'We were just in there and realised there was a really nice echo in the room. I went to shut the door a tiny bit and it shut the whole way. 'At first we sort of laughed, but when we phoned out friends to come and let us out they couldn't. 'After about 20 minutes of hearing banging on the door we realised no one could get us out. You would think someone would have the code for the door.' Rescue mission: Fire crews had to save the pair and this meant the exhibition was shut on Saturday . Light: The emergency crews managed to drill through the wall and pass the pair glow sticks and ear plugs . Although the two art enthusiasts could hear noise outside, they were unaware what was going on, but were told the fire service had been called. The first crews arrived at 1.48am and initially tried to unlock the door. But when that didn't work, they had to drill through the wall to create a hole large enough for the two men to escape. 'They tried drilling for two hours but then had to call for back-up and then more back-up,' Mr Church said. Part of Havelock Street, in Cardiff, was closed for the emergency services to access the building. The initial amusement and novelty of the situation quickly wore off, said Mr Church. 'We started off with fairly high hopes. The first few hours we were singing and running around the room and trying to make the best of it. 'After two or three hours, before there was an air hole, we started to think ""Are we going to get out of here?""'. At that point, two fire engines and a specialist urban search and rescue team arrived and use drilling equipment to penetrate the thick concrete walls. The emergency crews drilled a small hole through the vault door to speak to the pair and passed them glow sticks for light and ear plugs. They then handed them a plastic tube through a hole to enable them to drink water. Strangers: Jacob Church (left) and Joe Tobin (right) were locked in the vault in total darkness for six hours . Mr Church, a former lab technician at Specsavers, added: 'We got a phone call about every half an hour from a police woman who kept asking us if our oxygen levels were OK. 'It was worrying but I told them if it does run out what can they do for us anyway?' The fire crews drilled around 15 inch-wide holes into the thick wall, which was reinforced with metal bars. They eventually created a big enough hole for the two men to crawl out unharmed at 6.45am. Exhibition curator Ariell Tye, 31, said they always kept the vault door open for 'health and safety reasons'. She said: 'Some people were messing around and have physically closed the door themselves which is pretty difficult in itself. 'They have turned the wheel lock door mechanism and couldn't get back out. We were informed immediately and phoned the emergency services straight away. 'When the two men came out they were in good spirits and were unharmed.' Ms Tye said the artists took over the former bank last June for no rent because the building will be demolished in two years to make way for the new BBC Wales headquarters. She said there was no chance of a repeat incident because the vault door was now permanently locked. A South Wales Fire and Rescue Service spokeswoman said: 'It's an unusual one by any stretch of the imagination. 'We received a call to a premises at 1.48am. Two male persons were rescued from an internal bank vault. 'There was a limited air supply in the nature of it being a bank vault and our urban search and rescue team were called in with specialist equipment. 'There were no injuries. We were assisted by paramedics and police were also in attendance.' The gallery was closed on Saturday, but will reopen as normal on Wednesday.","Jacob Church, 21, and Joe Tobin, 29, were locked inside bank vault .

"Testimony got under way Tuesday in the murder trial of a 24-year-old Kentucky woman who is accused of fatally shooting her lawyer boyfriend in the face in 2012. Shayna Hubers has been charged with murder in the October 12, 2012, of 29-year-old Ryan Poston inside his condominium in Highland Heights, Ohio. Hubers, who was 21 at the time, claimed she was acting in self-defense because the young attorney was shoving and hitting her, but during an interview with police she was quoted as telling a detective she gave Posten 'the nose job he wanted.' Gun-toting girlfriend: Shayna Hubers (left), 24, is on trial in the 2012 shooting death of her lawyer boyfriend, 29-year-old Ryan Poston . Crime scene: Police say Hubers shot Poston six times inside his Highland Heights, Ohio, condominium . On the first day of testimony Tuesday, jurors were shown a video of the defendant’s interview with police following the slaying. 'He was screaming at me at the top of his lungs after he had thrown me around the room,' the woman told a detective sitting across from her, reported Cincinnati.com. ‘I shot him enough times to kill him,’ she said, ‘so that he wouldn't suffer... He was laying there, twitching and making noises, and I shot him in the head. ‘I was watching him die. it was painful to watch him die and to know that I had done that,' reported WCPO. Hubers then described her late boyfriend of one year as 'vain' about his looks. ‘I shot him right here,’ she said in the video as she pointed to her nose. ‘I gave him his nose job he wanted.’ Gallows humor: Jurors were shown a videotaped police interview with Hubers, in which the woman, then 21, said Poston was 'vain' and she gave him the 'nose job he wanted' by shooting him in the face . Troubled: Poston's family described his relationship with Hubers, left, as tumultuous and said that the 29-year-old was trying to end it . Prosecutors argued that the woman intentionally shot the attorney six times across a table, including once in the face, after Poston tried to end their relationship. Hubers' attorneys have maintained that their client shot Poston to protect herself. During questioning, Hubers explained to detectives that she went to Poston's home ‘with the best intentions’ not to kill him, but to convince him to work out their differences and mend their relationship. But when she arrived, Poston allegedly 'resorted to violence.' The woman said the lawyer made fun of her speaking voice, insulted her family, and physically assaulted her by pushing and dragging her around. She detailed how the 29-year-old victim allegedly pushed her down against the arm of the couch and threw her against furniture in the moments before the first shot rang out. ‘He said, “You're just a hillbilly from Kentucky.” And I am. I guess the hillbilly came out in me, and I took up for myself,’ she told police in the recording played in court. Hubers’ trial is expected to last two weeks. She is being held in jail on $1.5million bond. Woman scorned: Hubers told police how Ryan Poston allegedly pushed and shoved her, insulted her family and mocked her for being a 'hillbilly from Kentucky.' She said: 'I guess the hillbilly came out in me, and I took up for myself’ Ryan Poston graduated from Salmon P. Chase College of Law, Northern Kentucky University in 2008, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and uncle. In May 2012, he started his own law practice specializing in personal injury cases in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. His family and friends have described him as a bright and hard-working young lawyer who had a promising future ahead of him. He is survived by his parents and three sisters. Hubers graduated from Lexington’s Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in 2009. In the fall of 2010, she made the Dean’s List at the University of Kentucky as a sophomore psychology major.

"A Catholic school teacher suspended after she wrote a Facebook post claiming that gays were behind an 'agenda' to 'reengineer western civ into slow extinction' has been reinstated. Patricia Jannuzzi was put on administrative leave last month and was asked to disable her Facebook page when her comments drew wide publicity, in part after school alumnus Scott Lyons wrote a critical letter that was shared online by Thelma & Louise star Susan Sarandon, who's his aunt. Another one of Jannuzzi's posts compared a lesbian relationship to news of Egyptian men being beheaded and she said that 'secular materialists (are) making our country so weak we cannot fight the dictatorship of Militant Islam.' Patricia Jannuzzi, right, who wrote in a Facebook post that gays were behind an 'agenda' to 'reengineer western civ into slow extinction', has been reinstated at Immaculata High School despite protests from the likes of Susan Sarandon . A letter was sent on Friday to faculty and staff members at Immaculata High School in Somerville saying Jannuzzi had been reinstated, Gannett New Jersey reports. Monsignor Seamus Brennan, pastor of the Church of the Immaculate Conception, said in the letter that Catholic teachers should communicate the faith in 'a way that is positive and never hurtful.' 'Tone and choice of words matter and I trust Mrs. Jannuzzi's stated promise to strive always to teach in a spirit of truth and charity,' Brennan wrote. He cited Jannuzzi's 'otherwise good reputation as an educator over 30 years at Immaculata' as a factor. After school officials and Diocese of Metuchen Bishop Paul Bootkoski distanced themselves from Jannuzzi's remarks, the diocese was on the end of a backlash from conservatives and traditionalists upset that the school and church did not side with their teacher against a liberal Hollywood activist. Jannuzzi's family, fearing she would lose her job, raised more than $31,000 online. A letter was sent on Friday to faculty and staff members at Immaculata High School in Somerville said Jannuzzi had been reinstated . Monsignor Seamus Brennan, pastor of the Church of the Immaculate Conception, said in the letter that Catholic teachers should communicate the faith in 'a way that is positive and never hurtful' After Bootkoski issued a statement that Jannuzzi continued to receive salary and benefits and that no long-term decision over her job had been made, the Catholic leader was slammed on two radio ads broadcast and accused of trying to cover up Jannuzzi's firing. In a statement posted on the fundraising page, Jannuzzi's attorney David Oakley said all of the contributions would be returned. Oakley said Jannuzzi was 'very happy' with the turn of events. 'I'm delighted with the understanding,' he said Friday. 'We're grateful to the school for engaging in the process.' Michael Hichborn, president of Lepanto Institute, the conservative Catholic group that paid for the radio ads, said on Friday he was surprised by the news. Sarandon's nephew Scott Lyons has criticized his former school for reinstating a teacher who he accused of 'blatant intolerance for the LGBT community' 'That's excellent. It was a great injustice and thank God that the right outcome came about,' he said. 'If they changed their mind I hope it is for a matter of justice and not for a matter of looking to see which way the wind is blowing.' The alumni petition on Change.org was closed by the organizer with 1,188 signatures. In a message, organizer Tom Robinson declared victory. 'As a result of the petition, Immaculata High School acknowledged the problem and decided to review their social media policy. Due to the media firestorm that occurred, the teacher was put on administrative leave,' he said. 'We have taken a stand and brought attention to an important subject: Intolerance should not be acceptable in a public forum, especially not by a teacher who could be alienating children at the school.'","Patricia Jannuzzi, wrote in a Facebook post that gays were behind an 'agenda' to 'reengineer western civ into slow extinction'

"A couple spent two years battling the council over a £2.20 parking ticket they say blew off their dashboard - and ended up having to pay £400. Shane O'Byrne and wife Jaimie received the fine after they took their newborn baby Cristabelle out for the first time in March 2013. In the process of getting out of the car the ticket they had bought fell on the floor just underneath the driver's seat - invisible to the warden who issued them with a penalty. Escalating row: A couple spent two years battling the council over a £2.20 parking ticket they say blew off their dashboard - and ended up being ordered to pay £400. The couple explained to the authorities what had happened but were not let off the fine. Adamant they would not pay it, the O'Byrne's exchanged a number of letters with the council over the next two years - with the row escalating from an initial £25 fine to bailiffs knocking on their door and demanding £400. Mr O'Byrne, from Southsea in Portsmouth, Hampshire, was forced to pay the sum to Chichester District Council after the incident in a car park in Chichester, West Sussex. Mr O'Byrne, a self-employed marketing consultant, said: 'We parked in a marked bay and purchased a ticket. 'As this was the first time we'd taken our first child out of the house it was all a bit of an ordeal getting her and the buggy out, out of the way of other traffic. 'In my haste I failed to attach the ticket firmly to the inside of the windscreen. 'On our return to the car I found a parking ticket on the windscreen and found my ticket on the floor just under the driver's seat. Not backing down: Chichester Council have insisted they followed the correct procedures and made the 'appropriate decision' 'As this was an unfortunate occurrence I assumed it would be cleared up by us sending a letter and the actual ticket to Chichester council explaining what had happened, which I did. 'I was therefore a little shocked to hear that the council were not interested in my story.' The council didn't cancel the fine and both parties involved corresponded a number of times over the coming months. The family moved house to another address in Southsea over the two-year period and said he informed the council of his move. But bailiffs turned up at his old house, where Mr O'Byrne has tenants, and demanded payment or to take belongings to the value of £400. Mr O'Byrne believes the whole row has been a waste of time and money for the council, he said: 'I understand there is a process but common sense should have prevailed. 'It was a £2.20 ticket that I actually bought. I can't understand why local government can't use common sense.' In a letter to the council he stated: 'All I ever asked is that a government, and therefore taxpayer-funded, organisation treated this case with common sense and they did not waste taxpayers' money on a totally unnecessary campaign based on a ticket that was paid for.' He admitted he would have paid the initial £25 fine if he knew the row would cause him so much grief. A spokeswoman for Chichester District Council said: 'We understand it's not nice receiving a penalty notice but we do need to manage parking activity in the district effectively and we treat each case both fairly and transparently. 'Our parking enforcement team follows the legislation within the Traffic Management Act. 'This particular case has been through three stages, one of which was an independent traffic penalty tribunal. 'All agreed that the council had followed the correct procedures and had made the appropriate decision.'","Shane O'Byrne and wife Jaimie received the parking fine in March 2013 .

"Los Angeles Kings forward Jarret Stoll was arrested on Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada, on drug possession charges, according to reports. Stoll, 32, is the longtime boyfriend of Dancing With The Stars host Erin Andrews, a former ESPN employee who now works as an NFL sideline reporter for Fox Sports. The NHL player was arrested on suspicion of possession of cocaine and MDMA at the Wet Republic pool at the MGM Grand Hotel shortly before 5pm. Stoll was previously in the news for non-sports related reasons back in 2013 when he was rushed to the hospital after having a seizure at his home in Hermosa Beach, California during the offseason, with the Kings later saying they did not know what caused the incident.

"A retired Calgary couple who were attacked by pirates during a sailing trip in Honduras two weeks ago said they're grateful to be alive after the terrifying incident. Loretta Reinholdt, 54, and Andy Wasinger, 46, were on their second day into a trip from Belize to the Honduran island of Roatan in which they were learning to sail on a 17-meter-long hired boat with a captain when they were attacked. Four men with guns and knives boarded the sailboat and took all of their money after waving down the sailboat by asking for gas. Reinholdt (left) and Wasinger (right) were on a hired sailboat with a captain two weeks ago when four men waved them down, boarded the boat with guns and knives and demanded money before pushing their boat to the shore of a remote beach, leaving the couple and captain stranded for four days . 'They were yelling,' Reinholdt, a former nurse, told CBC. 'They were demanding more money. They didn't believe we only had that amount. And the more angry they got, the more scary it was. 'And they actually had me, pulling my hair and a knife on my throat, demanding more money from the captain.' Wasinger, a former computer programmer, added: 'I knew we had to comply with the pirates and not be heroes.' After the terrifying hold-up, the pirates pushed the sailboat to the shoreline of a remote beach in Jeanette Kawas National Park, cut the main sail and tore out the engine wire, leaving the couple and their captain stranded. They also took gasoline, the radio and drinking water from the boat. The couple and captain made SOS messages with branches along a park trail, which was discovered by hikers four days later. 'It was great. It was one of the best moments of my life, I think. I was ecstatic,' Wasinger told CTV News. 'I know we can go through anything in life now after this situation. We are a lot closer as a couple and we live life every day as if it is our last.' During their time in the jungle, they survived on rainwater, peanut butter and cheese and make a make-shift tent to stay in until they were saved. 'We hugged each other, we cried,' Reinholdt told CBS. 'And we couldn't thank them enough for doing this for us, because they were also brave that they actually came to the area. So, it's unbelievable. We were so happy to be alive.' Their rescuers took trio to the town to Tela, where they met Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who happened to be staying in the area. He offered them a presidential helicopter ride to the nearest airport and the country's government handled the bill for the couple to fly to Mexico, where they were sent to recover. Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs told CBS that they were aware of the attack and consular officials at the Tegucigalpa embassy have been in contact with local authorities to gain more information. 'Canadians travelling to Honduras should be aware that serious crime — including armed robbery, kidnapping, carjacking, home invasion and sexual assault — is common, and armed attacks on marine vessels have been reported,' foreign affairs spokesman Nicolas Doire said in a statement. He added that there is a travel advisory regarding safety and security in the country on the the government of Canada's website. And as for Reinhold and Wasinger, they told the Calgary Herald that though this was their first sailing trip, it will likely be their last. Buthey might return to Honduras - only they would stay in populated areas and would not go alone. 'I can't say enough about how the Honduran people helped us,' Reinholdt said. 'Everyone was so friendly.'","Loretta Reinholdt, 54, and Andy Wasinger, 46, were on on a hired sailboat with a captain when they were attacked .

"Injuries: The exploding phone caused injuries so deep that doctors could see Hanghang's jawbone . A 12-year-old in central China was seriously injured when his phone exploded while it was charging. The boy, known only as Hanghang, was using the old handset as an alarm when he woke up early for school and started to play with it. He said the phone felt hot and then blew up in his face, exposing part of his jawbone and embedding fragments in his arms and legs. 'I played with the phone for a few minutes,' he said. 'The phone felt hot then it suddenly exploded and all I could see were my hands covered in blood and blood dripping from my face. 'I used a towel to stem the blood and washed my hands under the tap then I called the ambulance.' Hanghang, from Pingdingshan City, in the Henan province, told reporters at People's Daily Online that when the explosion happened he didn't dare tell his parents and called the ambulance service himself following the accident last week. He is now being treated in Ping Mei Group Hospital and is expected to need several operations to repair the damage. Hurt: Hanghang pictured lying in a hospital bed after a mobile phone exploded, injuring his face and hand . Doctors said he had 4cm injury to his face which exposed part of his lower jawbone as well as trauma to his left hand as well as lower legs and knees. He underwent emergency surgery before he was sent to the burns unit and onto the plastic surgery inpatient department. Experts believe there are three main reasons a phone may explode like this. The first is the battery itself is damaged and although it is connected to a charger it isn’t actually charging. A short circuit is another possible cause but this is a less likely unless the phone has been illegally modified in some way. The most common cause  is improper charging. It affects lithium batteries more where the phone may be fully charged but is left on charging or if phone is used whilst charging may lead to lithium batteries overheating. Overheating and poor contact can result in a sudden discharge of a current and cause an explosion. Tips include to avoid using the phone while the battery is being charged by disconnecting the phone from charger before connecting a call or using any of its functions. Ensure it is not over-charged by removing the electric supply when the battery is fully charged. If the battery seems to have swollen, it should be replaced immediately. Hanghang said he could not be sure of the type of phone as it was one of several old phones. He said: 'It was the battery that exploded. I have heard my classmates talk about this happening but I never thought it would happen to me.'","Hanghang was playing on the phone after waking up early for school .

"Police in Surrey are hunting two raiders who stripped off their tops during the hottest day of the year before holding up an Esso petrol station. The men, who were both in their 20s, . These bare-chested men had stripped off before raiding a petrol station on the hottest day of the years so far and were caught on camera. Police in Surrey have released CCTV of the two raiders who stripped-off their shirts before attempting to rob the Esso filling station in Town End Caterham, Surrey early last Wednesday evening . The men forced their way into the manager's office of the filling station in Caterham, pictured, looking for cash . Police released these images of the men which they hope will lead to calls from the public, identifying them. The two men were among three who burst into the Esso petrol station in Town End, Caterham, Surrey, last Wednesday. They forced their way into the manager's office and were ransacking the room, looking for cash, when they were disturbed by a member of the garage staff and fled. A spokesman for Surrey Police said: 'Officers were called to the Esso petrol station after three men entered the store, forced entry into the manager's office and whilst ransacking the room were disturbed by staff. They left with a mobile phone belonging to a member of staff. 'No-one was injured during the incident which occurred at around 7.45pm.' Police constable Natalie Pearce said: 'Since the incident we have made a number of inquiries into the burglary including viewing CCTV. We believe the men captured on camera will be able to assist us with our investigation.

"An argument between two Brisbane neighbours over noise levels has ended in tragedy with one man dead and another charged with manslaughter. Leon Yeaman, 55, was allegedly killed by a single punch in the head from 28-year-old shift worker Phillip Pama, 28, during a row in front of their north Brisbane homes. Mr Yeaman was reportedly in his yard on Muller Road making a lot of noise at around 9pm Thursday night. Phillip Pama covered his face as he left Brisbane Magistrate Courts where he was granted conditional bail on Friday . Pama, a married father of three, works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time Mr Yeaman was making a commotion. Pama’s defence lawyer Bruce Peters said Mr Yeaman was known for getting drunk, playing loud music and yelling at ‘the world at large’. Pama then confronted Mr Yeaman and it was at that point the situation escalated. Mr Peters said his client grabbed his neighbour by the hand and hit out ‘blindly’. ‘He was being pushed at the same time he was throwing the punch,’ Mr Peters revealed during a bail application for Pama. ‘He didn't see it connect but he felt it connect.’ The father of three allegedly killed his 55-year-old neighbour with one punch after he refused to turn his music down . Paramedics were unable to revive Mr Yeaman who was pronounced dead at the scene at around 11pm on Thursday night. Neighbours described Mr Yeaman as king and generous while his friend John Fisher told ABC Radio he was a schizophrenic pensioner who enjoyed playing loud music. Pama shielded his face from reporters outside Brisbane Magistrate Courts when he was granted bail on Friday. The Samoan man was ordered to surrender his passport, aherre to a curfew from 6pm to 2am and will have to report to the local police station twice a week. Pama, who has no history of violence, was reportedly ‘beside himself’ with grief. The case is due to return to court on May 18.","Two men got in an argument about noise levels on Thursday night .

"After years of suffering behind its barbed wire fences, watching those they loved waste away before their eyes while Nazi guards systematically slaughtered them by the tens of thousands - this is the moment the inmates of Bergen-Belsen watched as the death camp was burned to the ground. Steeped in human misery, these huts once contained the bodies of thousands of Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and the disabled, sent to an inhuman death by Adolf Hitler and his demented regime. Diarist Anne Frank, and her sister Margot, also died here. Shortly after the camp was liberated by British and Canadian troops in 1945, it was torched, and at least part of that suffering was destroyed forever as the buildings, along with the Reichskriegs flag and Hitler portrait which adorned them, were consumed by flames. These hellish images, which were taken by British Reverend Charles Martin King Parsons, captured that poignant moment in history for future generations to remember. Infamous: This is the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany as it appeared in the days after it was liberated by British and Canadian troops, adorned with the German Reichskriegs flag (left) and a portrait of Hitler (right) Historic: As a crowd of people watch on, British troops burn the buildings to the ground. These never-before-seen images were captured by Reverend Charles Martin King Parsons, who was one of a handful of chaplains who helped liberate it . Up in smoke: The camp, which became the final resting place of 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and those with disabilities, is burned to the ground after liberation in 1945 . Gone, but not forgotten: The images were uncovered by Tom Marshall, the great-grandson of Mr Parsons, who said he is proud that his great-grandfather was brave enough to take the pictures, so future generations do not forget what happened . Send off: In dramatic scenes soldiers line up in front of a stage as the camp is torched, bringing to an end the suffering inside . Mr Parsons, orginally from Leicestershire, was one of just a handful of British Army chaplains who made it inside the camp, and whose job it would have been to help cure the sick, and offer last comforts to those who were beyond saving. Anne Frank, whose diaries of persecution at the hands of the Nazis became the defining account of the Holocaust, was just one of Bergen-Belsen's many victims. Frank was living in the Netherlands when the Nazis seized it in 1940, leaving them trapped. In 1942 they were forced into hiding in secret rooms hidden inside Otto Frank's office building. They spent two years there, but were anonymously betrayed and sent to the concentration camps. Anne, and her sister Margot, were taken to Bergen-Belsen, where they died of typhus in February 1945, just months before the Allies liberated it. When the Allied troops arrived at Bergen-Belsen, it was in the grip of a terrible typhus outbreak, with prisoners dying at a rate of 500 a day. A sombre sign erected by the British Army, and photographed by Mr Parsons, documents at least part of that grisly death tool, revealing that 13,000 people perished even after troops came to their aid. In other images he documents pits filled with the emaciated corpses of the dead, and cramped buildings filled with the typhus-ridden bodies of those who were still alive. The images were brought to light by Mr Parsons' great-grandson Tom Marshall, 27, who decided to publish the pictures after finding them tucked inside an old box among his grandmother's possessions. Mr Marshall, a photo restorer who lives in Glasgow, said: 'I often come across very interesting historical photographs showing stories that impel me to dig deeper and find out as much as I can about the people in the pictures, and what they did with their lives. 'I never knew him, but my grandmother said he never talked about his time in the war. I didn't know why, but now I understand. 'We had no idea he had taken these pictures, and I feel now is the right time to share them. Words struggle to describe the unbridled horror within.' Charles served in the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War, and because he was aged 39 when the Second World War broke out, he initially joined the Home Guard. However he transferred to the regular Army, and was eventually sent to Germany. Charles was one of a handful of British Army chaplains who entered the camp in the days following liberation. The pictures show the temporary sign erected by the British shortly after the camp was liberated, revealing just part of the grim death toll. During the course of the war, Bergen-Belsen became the final resting place for over 50,000 Jews, Poles, Soviets, opponents of the Nazis, homosexuals, and Gypsies. Chilling: This temporary sign was erected by British troops, detailing just a portion of the grisly death total, which eventually reached 50,000 . Sickening: Inside one of the camp hut, the sick and the dying huddle on the floor in the appalling conditions their Nazi captors left them in . Clinging on: Survivors huddle inside tents in the wasteland in the centre of the Bergen-Belsen camp, where diarist Anne Frank also died . Horrific: Around 500 people were dying per day of typhus and starvation when the Allies arrived. The number of bodies was so great that the Nazi captors had given up burying them, and had simply dumped many in the woods . Mr Marshall added: 'Perhaps the most discussed Jewish victim of the Holocaust Anne Frank died in Belsen shortly before the liberation, probably of typhus which was rife among the dying. 'When my great-grandfather arrived at the camp there were nearly 500 people dying each day, from the appalling conditions and the typhus outbreak. 'Along with the other chaplains, medical staff and medical volunteers, he saved many lives and gave both spiritual and medical support to the survivors. 'They were all true heroes - I'm so proud he documented what he saw, because it's important for future generations not to forget.' After the war, Charles returned to his work as a vicar, and raised two children, Tom's grandmother Ruth and sister Joan before dying aged 54, in 1953. Mr Marshall said: 'I never knew him as he died 35 years before I was born but I do know he was a brave man who saved many lives. 'I have also come to learn how important the non-military members of the forces were, and still are, providing essential support and care at times of need. I'm very proud of my great-grandfather and I know that you don't have to be a soldier to fight a war.' Slaughter: More emaciated bodies are piled in one of the many shallow graves that surrounded the camp, located in northern Germany . Mr Parsons (left) took the pictures following the camp's liberation after he went inside with other British troops to tend to the sick. When the camp was discovered, up to 500 people a day were dying there from typhus . Burial: British soldiers and German locals helped to bury the dead in the days after the camp was liberated from the Nazis 70 years ago .","British Reverend Charles Martin King Parsons was one of a handful of chaplains to enter Bergen-Belsen camp .

"Pope Francis has accepted the resignation  of an American bishop who pleaded guilty to failing to report a priest who was a suspected child abuser. Bishop Robert Finn, 62, offered his resignation under the code of canon law that allows bishops to resign early for illness or some 'grave' reason that makes them unfit for office. But children's rights advocates are urging Pope Francis to do much more to deal with clergy who become embroiled in child sex scandals. Resignation: Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn who pleaded guilty to failing to report a suspected priestly child abuser . Action: Children's rights advocates are urging Pope Francis to do much more to deal with clergy who become embroiled in child sex scandals. Finn, who leads the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph in Missouri, got into trouble after he waited six months before notifying police about the Reverand Shawn Ratigan. Ratigan had a computer containing hundreds of lewd photos of young girls taken in and around churches where he worked. He was eventually sentenced to 50 years in prison after pleading guilty to child pornography charges. Finn pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of failure to report suspected abuse and was sentenced to two years' probation in 2012. It has made him the highest-ranking church official in the U.S. to be convicted of failing to take action in response to abuse allegations. Since then, he has faced constant pressure from local Roman Catholics to step down, with some parishioners petitioning Francis to remove him from the diocese. Outrage: Protesters, background left, shout as Rev. Juan Barros, center left,  enters the cathedral for the ceremony to assume as bishop in Osorno, southern Chile. Barros was ordained amid protests by sex-abuse victims who accuse him of covering up crimes his mentor  Rev. Fernando Karadima  whom the Vatican has sanctioned for abusing young boys . Despite a catalog of child sex cases within the catholic church, so far, no U.S. bishop has been forcibly removed for covering up guilty clergy. Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the online abuse resource BishopAccountability.org, said while Finn's resignation was a welcome step - more has to be done. She has called on Francis to publicly state that he was removed for mismanaging the Ratigan case and failing to protect children. She noted that bishops had been allowed to resign under the previous two popes, but that the Vatican has never publicly linked their resignations to mishandling abuse cases. 'We urge Pope Francis to issue such a statement immediately. That would be unprecedented, and it would send a bracing message to bishops and religious superiors worldwide that a new era has begun,' she said. Meanwhile U.S. victims group SNAP, praised Finn's resignation as a 'tiny but belated step forward.' David Clohessy, a spokesman for SNAP said: 'After centuries of abuse and cover-up done in secrecy ... one pope has finally seen fit to oust one bishop for complicity in clergy sex crimes.That's encouraging. But it's only a very tiny drop of reform in an enormous bucket of horror.' Church: The Sacred Heart of Jesus church in Santiago, where Bishop Juan Barros is said by at least three victims to have witnessed sexual molestation . Last fall, The Vatican sent a Canadian archbishop to Finn's diocese as part of an investigation of his leadership. But until Tuesday, there had been no word about what the pope would do. Pope Francis is facing similar pressure to remove a Chilean bishop, Juan Barros, amid an unprecedented outcry over his appointment because of his longtime affiliation with the Reverend Fernando Karadima, who was sanctioned by the Vatican in 2011 for sexually abusing minors. Karadima's victims say Barros witnessed their abuse decades ago. But he has denied knowing anything until he read news reports of Karadima's crimes in 2010. The Vatican has defended the appointment. In a statement issued by the diocese, Finn said it had been an 'honor and joy for me to serve here among so many good people of faith.' He asked for prayers for the next bishop. Francis has already tapped Archbishop Joseph Naumann to lead the diocese temporarily until a new bishop is named. Naumann said he prayed 'that the coming weeks and months will be a time of grace and healing for the diocese.' Earlier this month, members of the pope's sex abuse advisory commission came to Rome in an unscheduled session to voice their concern about Chilean bishop Juan Barros. They are concerned that his longtime affiliation with the Reverend Fernando Karadima - who was sanctioned by the Vatican in 2011 for sexually abusing minors - makes him unsuitable to head child protection programs.","Bishop Robert Finn failed to notify police about a suspected child abuser .

"Controversial plans to spend £3.2million pulling down a 19th century country mansion and building a 'Butlins-style' gipsy camp have been approved despite angry protests by neighbours. Villagers in the small country hamlet of Cledford, near Middlewich in Cheshire, had vehemently opposed the plans saying that travellers could 'intimidate' nearby pensioners and may ruin the idyllic surroundings. But yesterday, Cheshire East Council gave the proposal the go ahead at a planning meeting, which will create a 'transit site' with room for nine gipsy families. The 200-year-old Cledford Hall in the small hamlet of Cledford in Cheshire which is being knocked down to make way for a 'Butlins-style' gipsy camp costing £3.2million . People living in the village have reacted with fury about the plans saying travellers could intimidate nearby pensioners . The mansion's Grade-II listed adjoining barn will be converted into 'washing and toilet' facilities and office accommodation for a resident warden will also be provided at the expense of taxpayers. The cost of the project, revealed through a Freedom of Information request, has left locals stunned, and they now fear their picturesque cottages will be left worthless as they contemplate selling up and leaving the area. Formerly Grade II-listed Cledford Hall, which dates back to 1822, was severely damaged by fire three years ago and its listing was cancelled. It will be fully demolished to make way for the site which will house gypsy families for a maximum of 28 days before they must move on. Around 100 letters of opposition were handed to the council alongside a petition comprising 500 signatures but they will continue with the plans - which also include a play area - in efforts to put a stop to ‘unauthorised encampments’. The £3.2million cost of the project was only revealed through a Freedom of Information request and got the go ahead yesterday by Cheshire East Council . Cledford Hall, which dates back to 1822, was severely damaged by fire three years ago and its Grade-II listing was cancelled . Builder Bob Moody, 66, bought a ‘dream’ retirement cottage with his wife Trisha, 61, and has spent £130,000 renovating it with original Victorian fittings. It now lies, almost finished, at the site’s entrance but he is refusing to move into it and fears he could lose £100,000 if it is put on the market. He said: 'We’re totally gutted. We’re not going to live there now. Can we sell it? It’s going to be so hard to sell. We honestly don’t know what to do. 'Most of my life savings have gone into this cottage. Do we chop the price to half of what it was worth or do we sit on it? Would anybody want to rent it from opposite a gypsy site? 'We were so confident we were going to get somewhere in that meeting because we had strong arguments especially in regards to fire safety, as the plans put the caravans too close together which flouts regulations. Builder Bob Moody at the gates to the site with local residents Ken Roden and George Beevers. He says he was only given three minutes to voice his concerns on behalf of residents at the planning meeting . Mr Moody beside the house he bought in Cledford as a retirement home. He is refusing to move into the property and fears he could lose £100,000 if it is put on the market . 'If they have to be three metres apart they may have to reduce the number of caravans. That means they could be spending up to £5million to accommodate six to eight families. It’s ludicrous. 'These types of transit families in Cheshire can be obstructive, they may fight with police, defecate in hedges, leave rubbish everywhere. These are not the sort of neighbours that OAPs want opposite them.' At the planning meeting, the strategic planning board of Cheshire East Council had eight votes in favour of the site, with one against. Three members abstained from voting. Residents also raised concerns that the new site would destroy local wildlife which had settled on the site of Cledford Hall, including grass snakes, hedgehogs and toads. A planning permission sign next to Cledford Hall. Cheshire East Council say the development is needed to house travellers in the area . Mr Moody added: 'None of us can understand why the council should think it necessary to spend such a large amount of money providing a luxury Butlin’s-style holiday camp for travellers in such lovely countryside. 'There could be a minimum of between 80 and 100 gypsies and travellers at any time. Some may be very pleasant and law abiding, but you will always get the few who aren’t. 'They are only allowed to stay for 28 days so you can’t form a relationship with these people. If we get the odd ones that fight and get drunk and cause trouble it will be very intimidating.' Mr Moody explained he was only given three minutes to voice his concerns on behalf of residents at the planning meeting. He added: 'I’m going to talk to a lawyer to see if there is any way we can get compensation. 'It is the direct action of Cheshire East Council that has lost me nearly £100,000 and I can’t recover that cost. 'This has totally ruined my retirement and retirement plans. I haven’t set a date for my retirement now because our dream was to go to our little idyllic comfortable country cottage in the fields of Cheshire and that’s been shattered now.' Building work on the site is due to go ahead in the near future since the passing of the final stage of the application. Councillor Don Stockton, head of housing and jobs for Cheshire East Council who lives in the nearby town of Alderley Edge and was part of the applying team, said: 'We need a site somewhere in Cheshire East as we have a lot of travellers in the area and have had a lot of unapproved sites where travellers have been and we have not been able to move them. 'This is an approved site which we have investigated and compared with many others across the borough. It is very difficult to get these things sited and there has been plenty of public opposition. 'I know there has been a lot of public angst and people haven’t liked it but I’m afraid that is going to be the case wherever you would wish to put a transit site. 'I do feel sorry for the nearby residents. I think if the site was on my doorstep it’s just a case if wherever these things are sited it is bound to have opposition. 'It wouldn’t matter whether it was next to my house or anyone’s house. With the best will in the world we have to try and pick the best site possible. 'It’s just inevitable there is opposition and I’m very sorry for those who have a problem with that. We are under a legal obligation to have site for travellers.” Middlewich, which borders Cledford, was named the UK’s fourth most desirable place to live in a Royal Mail study last year.","Plans for site for travellers has been approved by East Cheshire Council .

"Ever fancied driving the Batmobile straight from the big screen and into your street? Or perhaps you've always yearned to take the Ghostbusters' Cadillac for a spin? Well now it's possible to do both thanks to brothers Marc and Shanon Parker - who have designed and built a fantastic fleet of movie-inspired vehicles. Among their wonders on wheels are lifelike versions of Batman's Tumbler from the Dark Knight film trilogy and the much-loved Ghostbusters car - or Ecto-1 as the spook-hunting team call it. The brothers have even made an Optimus Prime truck, based on the most recent Transformers movie, as well as a Tron-inspired motorbike. Scroll down for video . Park your eyes on these beauties: The Parker brothers' Batman Tumbler and Ghostbusters Cadillac . Fuelling envy: Designer Shanon Parker fills up his Ecto-1 at a petrol station in Port Canaveral, Florida . Marc said: 'We get a lot of reactions in the street - a lot of times people will come up next to us and box us in, wanting to take pictures. 'We test-drove one of our motorcycles on the road and the police were called because we were causing a traffic jam. If you're doing something that's causing that kind of reaction, you know you're doing something right.' Take Bat! The brothers' impressive version of the Tumbler, Batman's car in the Dark Knight trilogy . Attention to detail: The number plate and interior are very similar to the original Batmobile . Real deal: The Tumbler in the 2005 movie Batman Begins, which was directed by Christopher Nolan . The car-crazy brothers from Port Canaveral, Florida, started  building versions of the vehicles they most loved for their own enjoyment four years ago. Marc, 45, said: 'We didn't have the money to pay people to customise vehicles for us, and what we needed didn't exist so we had to learn to build our parts. 'Every part of the Tumbler was made from scratch in our shop - the frame, chassis, wheels, glass, everything. 'I don't know what it cost to build - I'd probably cry if I looked into it - but as far as value, it's one of the most expensive vehicles we own.' Prime mover: A truck made to look like autobot Optimus Prime in last year's Transformers: Age of Extinction . Neat fleet: Marc (left) and Shanon show off their Tron-inspired bike and other vehicles at their workshop . He and Shanon, 44, have now turned their hobby into a business - called Parker Brothers Concepts - and they hire out their movie-inspired cars and motorbikes to fans. They also customise standard cars and bikes for clients, several of whom are famous. Shanon is in charge of design, while mechanic Marc brings the drawings to life in the brothers' workshop. He said: 'We mostly deal with a lot of celebrities and royalty since they have disposable income. 'We've had clients like 50 Cent, Flo Rida, Lil Wayne and John Cena, and have done work for Universal Pictures. 'The movie cars are used in promotions or premiers - clients want something that can be driven around rather than sit there like any other prop. 'Some of these cars can cost upwards of close to a million dollars, depending on what it is.' Classic car in a classic movie: The real Ecto-1 being driven in the 1984 blockbuster Ghostbusters . Almost identical: The Parker brothers' version makes a fuel stop - and puts the other cars in the shade . It hasn't always been an easy ride, however. Marc said: 'Shanon thinks if he can draw it, I can build it - but it's more difficult than that. 'He knows very little about mechanics so he's not limited like a lot of designers who have engineering degrees - there's nothing holding him back when it comes to design. 'In the beginning we fought because we come from different realms but now it's a back-and-forth process.' Made to order: The brothers in a Hummer SUV that they customised to look like an army tank for a customer . Rev-elations: Marc on one of his bikes, and the Green Machine that has won a world record . The brothers' ingenuity has earned them a place in the Guinness World Records, namely for their 'Green Machine', which was commissioned by the Huffy bike company for the re-release of the 1970s  toy of the same name. The Parkers' version has a 43-inch (109-cm) front wheel - the  largest ever wheel on a three-wheeled motorbike - and is powered by a Harley Davidson motor. Marc said: 'When someone says it can't be built, we gotta build it - we push ourselves and show people that you don't have to be limited to what's out on the market. 'We always want to get that wow factor. And when it's finished, it's like seeing a kid being born.'","Duo started out by making versions of famous vehicles they loved .

"Incumbent Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel celebrated Tuesday night a hard-fought victory in a tense run-off race against challenger Jesus 'Chuy' Garcia. Emanuel, a former White House chief of staff notorious for his brusque management style, was forced to campaign furiously across the city to beat Cook County Commissioner Garcia after failing to capture a majority against four other candidates in a February election. The mayoral runoff was the first since the city changed the way it conducts elections about 20 years ago. Scroll down for video . Four more years: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel celebrates a victorious election night at Plumbers Local 130 Union Hall, Tuesday, April 7 . Celebratory smooch: Mayor Emanuel exchanged a kiss with his wife, Amy Rule, as Chicago's first couple reveled in the runoff win . Second City's first family: Emanuel was joined on stage by his family, including (L to R), daughter Leah, wife Amy and son Zachariah . Rahm's entourage: Mayor Emanuel's brothers Ari, left, and Ezekiel Emanuel, smile as they celebrate his victory . ‘To all the voters I want to thank you for putting me through my paces,’ an elated Emanuel told supporters Tuesday night. ‘I will be a better mayor because of that. I will carry your voices, your concerns into ... the mayor's office.’ The 55-year-old mayor ascended the stage at Plumbers Local 130 Union Hall Tuesday night to the sounds of U2's Beautiful Day, accompanied by his wife, Amy Rule, their children and Emanuel's brothers, high-powered Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel and prominent bioethicist Ezekiel Emanuel. With nearly all voting precincts reporting results, Emanuel had about 56 per cent of the vote compared to around 44 per cent for his opponent. ‘To all the little boys and girls watching: We didn't lose today, we tried,’ Garcia told his supporters gathered at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ‘We fought hard for what we believed in. You don't succeed at this or anything else unless you try.’ Garcia said he had called Emanuel to concede. The incumbent highlighted tough decisions he's made since succeeding former Mayor Richard M. Daley in 2011, but admitted that his management approach too often rubbed city residents the wrong way. He portrayed Garcia as too inexperienced to handle the city's financial crunch. Gracious: An elated Emanuel thanked voter for putting him through his paces and said he will be a better mayor because of it . All smiles: Mayor Emanuel's supporters were out in full force Tuesday night to celebrate his victory in the runoff . Sizable victory: With nearly all voting precincts reporting results, Emanuel had about 56 per cent of the vote compared to around 44 percent for his opponent . Many of those heading to the polls Tuesday said the election should be a signal. ‘Hopefully he [Emanuel] takes heed of the runoff when he should have been a shoo-in,’ said Richard Rowe, a 50-year-old, who planned to vote for the incumbent. Jesus Fernandez, a 44-year-old window washer who voted for Garcia, had the same view. ‘If he [Garcia] gets close, we might push Rahm to do something,’ Fernandez said. ‘At least we push him a little bit.’ Emanuel raised far more money than Garcia, plastered the airwaves with ads and had support from his former boss, President Obama, who cast an early ballot for him from Washington. The mayor faces huge obstacles in his second term, from fixing the worst-funded pension systems of any big US city to stemming stubborn violence and confronting labor unions that just spent millions trying to defeat him. Chicago's four pension systems are about $20billion in debt, and the fund for Chicago Public Schools teachers is short about $7billion of what's needed to pay benefits as promised. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, Sr. waits backstage before Cook County Commissioner Jesus 'Chuy' Garcia gives his concession speech during an election night event at the University of Illinois . Failed bid: Chicago mayoral candidate Jesus 'Chuy' Garcia conceded the runoff election  at the UIC Forum . Garcia told his supporters: 'We didn't lose today, we tried. We fought hard for what we believed in' Garcia's support is seen wiping her eyes while listening to his concession speech Tuesday . If Emanuel can't work a deal with labor unions or get the Illinois Legislature to approve relief, the city is on the hook for an additional $550million payment to the retirement accounts, bringing the total payment to about $1billion. He's said that would be roughly equal to the annual cost of having 4,300 police officers on the street or raising property taxes by 150 percent. Emanuel also must deal with ongoing concerns about crime, one of the areas Garcia hit him on repeatedly during the election. After a spike in homicides early in his first term, the number fell to the lowest level in a half-century though the number of shootings has climbed 12 per cent. ‘I'm proud of what we've accomplished in these past four years, but I understand the challenges we face will require me to approach them differently and to work in a different fashion,’ Emanuel said. ‘The only way to meet these challenges is to bridge the gaps between the things that divide us and start focusing on the things that unite us and bring us together.’ Garcia, a former community organizer, alderman and state lawmaker, ran a campaign focused on the city's neighborhoods, with support from teachers and unions upset with Emanuel.

In this March, 31, 2015 file photo, Emanuel, left, and challenger, Cook County Commissioner Garcia, appear during a televised mayoral debate in Chicago . He accused the mayor of being out of touch with voters and blamed him for the fiscal problems, while playing up the mayor's push to close about 50 schools and a gang violence problem that spiked during Emanuel's first term. He also vowed to end Chicago's troubled red-light camera system, which some residents believe is discriminatory and focuses more on revenue than safety. Election officials said more than 142,300 Chicago voters cast early ballots for the runoff, far outpacing early voting turnout in February and four years ago.","With nearly all voting precincts reporting results, Emanuel had 55.5 per cent of the vote compared to 44.5 per cent for his opponent .

"A woman's life was saved after her doctor discovered she had stomach cancer during prep for gastric bypass surgery . Rachel Sandridge, 29, from Maryland, says she was shocked at the unexpected diagnosis but thankful to her diligent doctor. Sandridge was due to undergo the surgery after her weight reached 430lbs. Rachel Sandridge, 29, from Maryland, was due to undergo the surgery after her weight reached 430 pounds.. but durring the prep her doctor discovered she had cancer. Pictured: Sandridge (left) before surgery and after . She had to lose weight to qualify for the surgery and then underwent a routine endoscopy, to examine her digestive tract to ensure it was all healthy. But it was during the procedure her doctor was concerned at signs of inflammation and took a biopsy to sample. Sandridge was then told cancer had been found in her stomach. The cancer diagnosis was even more devastating as only two years earlier her father has died from cancer. Pictured, at his funeral in 2012 . Sandridge before the operation. She is now cancer-free and has dropped her weight from about 430lbs to about 288lbs, including about 50lbs before her gastric bypass . Stomach cancer is a relatively rare form of the disease, with fewer than 25,000 cases annually in the US. The early symptoms are vague and easy to mistake for other, less serious conditions. They include: persistent indigestion and heartburn, trapped wind and frequent burping, feeling very full or bloated after meals, persistent stomach pain . As the disease develops, more advanced symptoms include: blood in your stools, or black stools loss of appetite weight loss . In many cases, due to the face the early symptoms are so similar to other conditions, the disease is often advanced by the time it is detected. It is vital people suffering the early symptoms get checked by their doctor as soon as possible. There are different types of stomach cancer - 95 per cent of cases develop in the cells of the stomach lining - known as adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Less common forms of the disease include lymphoma of the stomach, which develops in the lymphatic tissue and gastrointestinal stromal tumours, which develop in the muscle of the stomach wall. Around 15 per cent of stomach cancer patients live at least five years after diagnosis, and around 11 per cent live for 10 years. Source: NHS Choices . Stomach cancer is a relatively rare form of the disease, with fewer than 25,000 cases annually in the US. The early symptoms are vague and easy to mistake for other, less serious conditions. 'It didn't fully click. I was scared and really nervous,' Sandridge told ABC. The news was even more devastating as only two years earlier her father has died from cancer. 'I know the toll it puts on you,' Sandridge said. She underwent a second during which the tumor itself and further cells were scrapped. The tumor was reviewed and Sandridge was told the cancer had been caught at an early state and it had not spread through the muscle wall. Sandridge did not need any chemotherapy or radiation and is now cancer-free. She has dropped her 10 dress sizes and weighs about 288lbs, and has more energy than before. Sandridge has had to adjust her diet following the operation as gastric bypass is a major surgical procedure, which changes eating and dietary habits dramatically. After surgery, the patients can no longer hold large quantities of food, but need to eat smaller amounts at regular intervals. The patients also need to eat in a different way as foods rich in fat, sugar and fibre may cause discomfort in the smaller stomach. 'If I'd not gone through with the [weight loss] surgery when I did, things would be 100 percent different,' she said to the Baltimore Sun. 'My cancer would have probably spread and it would have been too late to have had anything done about it.'","Rachel Sandridge, 29, from Maryland, says she was shocked at the unexpected diagnosis but thankful it was discovered .

"Kim Kardashian and husband Kanye West visited a centuries-old Armenian church in Jerusalem on Monday for the baptism of their daughter, North West. The Kardashians fended off swooning fans as they entered the Saint James Cathedral in Jerusalem's Old City. Archbishop Aris Shirvanian, an Armenian church official, said the family had arrived for a baptism ceremony. Scroll down for video . Surprise stop: Kim Kardashian, Kanye West and North West arrived in Jerusalem on Monday for North's baptism . Special visit: Kanye and North at the Armenian St. James Cathedral in Jerusalem's Old City . Sacrament: Archbishop Aris Shirvanian, an Armenian church official, confirmed North's baptism . VIP treatment: The family were escorted out of the church by a priest . Tight security: The group were surrounded by guards . No heels today: Kim wore sensible flat sandals for the ceremony . 'Kim Kardashian's daughter will be baptized and become a Christian officially and a member of the Armenian church,' Shirvanian said, slightly perplexed by all the commotion. 'All I know is that she's a famous personality. I don't know her in person. In any case she is welcome with her family.' A source tells E! that Khloe, who attended the ceremony wearing sneakers and ripped jeans, is North's godmother while the priest acted as her godfather (while uncommon, it is an option where there isn't one). The insider described the ceremony as 'so special'. The 22-month-old was dressed in a white gown and her father was wearing the same colour. Kim opted for a striped wrap-around dress and flat sandals. Afterwards, the family dined with Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat at Mona Restaurant. Members of reality TV's first family touched down Monday in the Holy Land for what was described as a private two-day visit. They family had earlier arrived in a private jet at Israel's international airport before being whisked away in a dark black SUV to a hotel in Jerusalem.

They are expected to shoot some footage for their reality show in Jerusalem before moving on to Jordan. Reality TV royalty: The star gave fans a regal wave . The family's Armenian tour certainly ended in spectacular fashion after Kanye gave a surprise free performance in the capital city, Yerevan, on Sunday night. He had to be rescued by security after being mobbed by fans in Swan Lake. Things got hectic when 'thousands' of fans followed his lead and waded into the water. Before striding into the shallow lake, he told the assembled crowd: 'Over there, can y'all see me over there? We're going to do something different right now, like, like, like we always do it this time!' Not too close! Kanye tried to keep the crowd at bay . As paparazzi scrambled to get a picture, security guards pulled Kanye out from the group of fans and police stopped the gig - which was being live streamed - from continuing. However, despite the abrupt ending to the set, which lasted just six songs, he and Kim appeared to have enjoyed the mayhem. His wife tweeted afterwards: 'Crazy night! Kanye wakes me up & says he's doing a free concert in Yerevan, Armenia! I throw on sweats & we go! Thousands of people were there! Kanye jumped in swan lake to be closer to the crowd on the other side & so many people jumped in too! Such an exciting crazy night!

Kim tweeted: 'I've learned on this trip how many talented Armenian musicians we have! What an incredible night!!!! Going to miss it here!!! Thank you to everyone who came out last night to see Kanye perform!' The reality TV star's Armenia trip had been very well-documented on the social media website, as she posted pictures of her, her sister Khloe, and cousins Kourtni and Kara, meeting the Armenian Prime Minister, as well as the two sisters having an 'emotional day' at the Genocide Museum - which they were visiting for a documentary they're filming about the Armenian Genocide. Kim tweeted: 'It was an honour to meet the Prime Minister of Armenia, Hovik Abrahamyan. He expressed how proud they are that we are proud Armenians and we have not forgotten our roots. #NeverForget'.

"Farmers in country Australia are renting their empty properties for $1 a week in an attempt to attract young families from the big smoke to invigorate their communities. Residents of rural towns like Cumnock, Errowanbang and Molong in NSW and Wicheproof in Victoria hope the bargain rentals will entice families with young children who can help populate their schools, save the local bus run and keep businesses open. Cumnock resident Christine Weston says the Rent-a-farmhouse initiative she set up in 2008 brought new life to her town of 280 people near Orange The town's population increased 30 per cent but those families are growing up and moving on. 'Country life still appeals to many families, but it doesn’t always make financial sense for them. We’re trying to change that,' Ms Westone told the Daily Telegraph. The Mercer family, who moved from Melbourne, at their country home in Cumnock. Theirs is one of the Rentafarmhouse properties which was put on the market for $1 a week to help regenerate the town's dwindling population . The view from the Mercer's Cumnock home, 'Barina', which is part of the Rent-a-farmhouse scheme . Scarlett Mercer enjoying country life in Cumnock. Scarlett's parents helped renovate the old 'Barina' homestead while renting the property for $1 a week . This farmhouse in Wycheproof, a wheat town  northwest of Melbourne, was leased for $1 a week in a bid to boost enrolments at the  local school and sports club . 'We offer $1 rent on the condition that the families who move in have kids, but can also contribute to bush communities with skills we’re short of,' Ms Weston said. Ms Weston says some farmhouses are being offered at  low rent because they need renovating. Others need a caretaker to look after the farm and some need skilled labour to help during busy harvest times and others need children to save the school bus run. Everyone is welcome to apply. The Mercer's country home called 'Barina' which is part of the Rentafarmhouse scheme . Cumnock was the first town to implement the Rentafarmhouse project but more than 20 rural communities from WA, Victoria, Tasmania and NSW have benefited from taking part in similar $1-a-week schemes. The sheep shearing town of Errowanbang, near Orange, saw its school enrolments increase 300 per cent after  residents started leasing properties to new families for next to nothing. In Rugby, 200kms south-west of Sydney, a school was saved. Its student  numbers had dwindled to two. Some of the $1-a-week farmhouses are rundown and in need of renovation, others need a caretaker for the farm or children in the community to keep local schools running . Soaring farming costs and droughts have seen the population of rural NSW towns like Cumnock, pictured here, dwindle. Residents are hoping to revive their communities by renting $1-a-week properties to young families . Cumnock farmer Robert Armstrong told the Telegraph he has decided to put his three-bedroom cottage on the market for $1-a-week as a way to keep the town he loves alive. 'The countryside desperately needs people to keep critical services going. If we don’t get more people coming here, things are going to keep shutting,' Mr Armstrong  said.

"The fiancee of fusilier Lee Rigby has found 'happiness' with an army major 27 years her senior. Aimee West, 24, is said to be in a relationship with Major Paul Draper – a former comrade of the murdered soldier. Just two years after Fusilier Rigby was hacked to death in Woolwich, south-east London, she is said to have formed a close bond with Major Draper, who was a mourner at her fiance's funeral. Scroll down for video . Lee Rigby's fiancée Aimee West (left) has found happiness with a friend of the murdered soldier, Major Paul Draper (right) Major Draper's ex-wife, Jane – whom he left for another woman in 2002 – said she was not surprised by his new relationship. Speaking from her home in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, yesterday, she said their three children were aware he was dating Miss West. 'He left me for a girl in the [Army] Cadets,' Mrs Draper said. 'He then was seeing another girl who he met in the Cadets, who he was with for around ten years.' It was this relationship, not his marriage, that Major Draper ended before spending time with Miss West. His ex-wife added: 'He's gone out with two other girls from the Cadets and one was 20 years younger.' Aimee West, 24, was devastated when her husband-to-be Fusilier Rigby (pictured) was hacked to death in the street in Woolwich, south east London, two years ago . According to reports, Miss West and Major Draper have been on several dates in the past few months. The 51-year-old, a decorated member of the Middlesex and North West Army Cadet Force, told the Sunday Mirror: 'I like to see Aimee. We are very good friends and we enjoy each other's company.' A source told the paper it was 'common knowledge they're dating', adding: 'If anyone deserves to be happy, it's Aimee. She's had a dreadful time. 'She'll never forget Lee – he was so important to her – but everyone wants her to be happy. Paul is a lot older than Aimee but he's been there for her since Lee died.' Major Draper separated from his latest partner, Priscilla, last November. He and Miss West have since attended a number of Cadet functions together and last month he comforted her at a St Paul's Cathedral service to honour fallen soldiers in Afghanistan. Miss West met Fusilier Rigby at an Army Cadets training camp in Wales in August 2012 and a year later they were engaged. Pictured from left, Aimee West, Lee Rigby's sister Sara McClure and his mother Lyn Rigby at the Old Bailey . Remembering him last year, she said: 'As soon as he turned up, everyone knew he was there because he was energetic and fast-paced, and like nobody else I ever met.' Miss West was 3,500 miles away at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan when she learned her fiance had been killed in front of horrified onlookers near Woolwich Barracks. British-born Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, mowed down Fusilier Rigby in a car as he was walking towards the barracks in a Help For Heroes hoodie, before hacking him to death with knives. They claimed the heinous act on May 22, 2013, was revenge for the killing of Muslims by British armed forces. They were both jailed for life. After the sentencing, Miss West said: 'I hope that this is the last we will hear from them both, so that I can focus on rebuilding my life and keeping Lee's memory alive.' Miss West met Fusilier Rigby at an Army Cadets training camp in Wales and became engaged in 2013 . Following Fusilier Rigby's death, Miss West quit the Army and has gone back to university, where she is studying to be a lawyer. She set up the Lee Rigby Fund as part of the Soldiers' Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association – and is set to run the London Marathon to raise money for the charity later this month. Last November, she spoke of her daily battle to block thoughts about the two Islamic extremists who murdered her fiance. In an interview, she said: 'I've mentally detached myself to be able to cope.' Miss West was not available for comment at her home in Feltham, west London, yesterday.

Blake Jerold Tucker, 19 (left) was one of five men who allegedly held down the unidentified victim while Brittany Leanne Parten, 23, filmed volunteer firefighters sexually assault a new recruit with a chorizo sausage . The board may vote to suspend the entire department at a meeting on Monday, according to NBC DFW. The victim came forward in late March to report the alleged attack, which he claims took place in January. In the recording, men can be heard 'yelling and laughing with excitement' while the victim is held down and bent over a couch. The group first tries to use a broomstick to sexually assault him and then decides upon the sausage. Satterfield and Getzendaner held a closed-door meeting with everyone after the incident where they told the victim and perpetrators to delete the video and not to tell anyone, according to an arrest warrant. They said that the victim could have taken legal action against the firefighters, but told him 'But you're not going to'. The chiefs said that they saw the video and Getzendaner said 'This is some funny s***', the affidavit claims. Preston Peyrot, 19 (left) and Keith Edward Wisakowsky, 26 (right), were arrested Monday and charged for the alleged assault which took place in January . Lieutenant Alec Chase Miller, 28 (left) and Casey Joe Stafford, 30 (right), were apparently trying to initiate a new recruit into their department . The recruit said that after the attack he crawled to the bathroom and vomited before showering off the smashed up sausage. His department colleagues then reportedly stole his clothes while he was bathing, forcing him to run naked to his car for shorts. Satterfield and Getzendaner face prison time of more than five years under Texas state law if convicted of tampering with a witness. They were released on $40,000 bail each, according to the Dallas Morning News. 'We are very, very saddened by the fact that people that we have relied, this board has relied on, the people of this county and this district have relied on have been accused of something so heinous as what has happened,' a spokesman for the Emergency Services District board said. Satterfield's attorney said that the affidavit does not show that his client committed any crimes. Satterfield and Getzendaner were released on $40,000 bail each. Above, the Emergency Services District No. 6 Volunteer Fire Department in Waxahachie, where the alleged assault took place . The five men thought to have taken part in the act, ranging in age from 19 to 30, were charged Monday with aggravated sexual assault. Twenty-six-year-old Keith Wisakowsky, 30-year-old Casey Stafford, 19-year-old Preston Peyrot, 28-year-old Alec Miller and 19-year-old Blake Tucker were all charged. Brittany Leanne Parten, 23, was charged with improper visual recording for using a cellphone to videotape the assault, an arrest warrant affidavit showed. Ellis County Judge Carol Bush said in a statement released to the Waxahachie Daily Light newspaper that Parten is not a firefighter with the department. At least one of the suspects is a lieutenant with the Emergency Services District No. 6 Volunteer Fire Department in Waxahachie. Alec Miller, 28, posted a $75,000 bond and was released on Tuesday from the Ellis County jail. According to the department's Facebook page, Miller was named the department's 2014 officer of the year. Neither the Texas Rangers, who are leading the investigation, nor the affidavit, give a motive for the assault. But Ellis County District Attorney Patrick Wilson said ""it was some sort of rite of initiation"" for a new recruit. The Ellis County's Emergency Services District No. 6 board voted to have the county fire marshal be placed in charge of services in the area, according to WFAA.","Man was allegedly bent over couch and sodomized during gruesome initiation ritual at Waxahachie, Texas, volunteer fire department .

"Tragedy: Dr. Frederic Brandt was battling with extreme depression before his suicide on Sunday a police report revealed on Tuesday . A friend insists Fredric Brandt was offended by a character on Tina Fey's new TV show that bore uncanny similarities to him - despite initial claims he 'laughed it off'. The cosmetologist killed himself on Easter Sunday, weeks after the March 6 launch of The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt on Netflix. In it, Martin Short plays a caricatured white-haired cosmetologist called Dr Franff with an inordinate amount of fillers in his face. Friends admit Brandt identified the resemblance - but most claim he jovially pointed it out and laughed. However, another friend, hair colorist Kyle White, told the New York Times his reaction was a front. 'He never thought it was fun,' White told the paper. 'He was about putting on a happy face in public.' The character has been targeted as a 'breaking point' for Brandt, who had allegedly started spending his Saturday nights at home injecting himself with fillers. One of his clients and friends Rosemary Hayt told the paper she spotted syringes for fillers in his bathroom at home in Chelsea, New York. She said: 'I thought, ""Oh, Fred, this isn't a good thing to be doing alone on a Saturday night."" 'It was disturbing thing, and I didn't want to think about it.' According to a growing body of voices, this worrying behavior was exacerbated by The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Sources close to Brandt said the doctor, who suffered from depression, told People magazine he was 'definitely hurt' by an apparent portrayal of himself on the Netflix show. The friend called the Kimmy Schmidt send up 'bullying,' but added that it did not cause his suicide. Sources were today opening up about how Brandt was wounded by the characterization - though they said that this suicide could not be pinned on one insulting TV show. A friend speaking to People said: 'It was making fun of him for the way he looked and it was mean and it was bullying. '...It wasn't the only thing troubling him, it was just one factor. It definitely hurt him. He was absolutely upset, who would want that? But that was not why he committed suicide. But it didn't help.' Another source, speaking to the New York Daily News, said that Brandt had become fixated on his appearance and cried in front of patients. The source said: 'He worked 15-hour days, his office was jam-packed, and I paid him a compliment. He was so sensitive he started to cry. He said how awful the public was, and how mean people are. He was really affected by negative feedback.' Scroll down for videos . Discovery: Dr. Brandt was found by a friend inside his home early on Sunday morning having taken his own life . Startling resemblance: Dr 'Franff' (played by Martin Short) – his name was Grant, but Franff is how he pronounced it due to all the surgery and injectables he'd presumably had - is lampooned in Tina Fey's Netflix show Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . Brandt worked with stars including Madonna, Stephanie Seymour and Jane Holzer. Left, the doctor is pictured with morning show host Kelly Ripa in 2011 at his Dr Fredric Brandt's SiriusXM launch and right, with comedian Joy Behar at the same event . Speaking out: Jeff Richmond, left in New York City today, spoke out on Monday over the death of Dr Fredric Brandt. The plastic surgeon was reportedly upset over his portrayal in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, which Richmond's wife Tina Fey, right with Martin Short, created and for which Richmond has producing credits . A police report into the tragic passing of the celebrity plastic surgeon revealed Brandt was suffering suicidal tendencies for just 10 days before he killed himself. Brandt was discovered hanged inside the garage of his Coconut Grove home by his friend, John Joseph Hupert, at around 9.15am on Easter Sunday morning. According to the police report, Hupert was concerned for his friend and was staying with the doctor because he was suicidal. The last time Hupert said he had seen Brandt alive was around 11.30pm on Saturday. The police report says that Brandt's psychiatrist Dr Saida Koita had become so worried for her patients state of mind that she ordered Hupert to stay with him to monitor him. She also revealed she had him on daily medication and was seeing him everyday for therapy sessions. When DailyMail.com asked Tina Fey's husband Jeff Richmond about Brandt's death near his home in New York City's Upper West Side, he said he hadn't been aware of it. Richmond is an executive producer and music composer on his wife's show. He said: 'That's very sad. I don't know anything about it. I just got home. Tina might know, I don't. She's not home.' Brandt was highly-regarded for his cosmetic work across the industry, with high-profile stars including Madonna, Stephanie Seymour and Kelly Ripa. The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami where he lived alone with his dogs.

Successful businessman: Dermatologist Dr. Frederic Brandt poses for a portrait with his newest additions to his skin-care line in 2013 . Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy. Franff's platinum blond hair and tight skin have a stark resemblance to that of cosmetic dermatologist Fredric Brandt . Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques. In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones. It was also widely known that Dr Brandt injected products including Botox, Restylane, Perlane, Juvéderm, Voluma, The Times reported, into his own face, erasing his wrinkles, leaving him with full lips and an ageless quality. The doctor told The Times that people often asked him if he was from Sweden. Brandt grew up in Weequahic neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey where his parents ran a candy store. His father died when he was a teenager and he lost his mother before he graduated from Rutgers University in 1971. He went on to attend Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia. He completed residencies at NYU's Department of Internal Medicine and then in Dermatology at the University of Miami. He set up a practice in Coral Cables, Miami in 1982 and began part-time work in New York in 1998 but quickly expanded to become one of the most in-demand cosmetic appointments.","Fredric Brandt had been suicidally depressed for 10 days before he took his own life .

"The sister of a missing woman who left a popular Spanish nightspot with two Brits who are now being probed over her disappearance has made a tearful video appeal for information on her whereabouts. Pretty Agnese Klavina, 30, vanished after being driven away from celebrity Puerto Banus haunt Aqwa Mist on September 6 last year. Older sister Gunta fought back tears as she described her sister as 'very beautiful' and spoke of her despair at the lack of news. Tearful: Older sister Gunta has made an emotional video appeal for information about Agnese's whereabouts . Blonde beauty: Agnese travelled to Marbella to start a summer job at the Ocean Club in Marbella, was wearing a multi-coloured halter neck dress and carrying a large white Louis Vuitton handbag when she left the club . Suspicion: Multi-millionaire property developer's son Westley Capper (left) and pal Craig Porter (right) were summoned to court on Monday in nearby Marbella . Looking pale-faced and drawn and speaking in a faltering voice, the 31-year-old said: 'It's been over seven months since she went missing and we don't know anything about her. 'I beg you. If anyone knows anything about her whereabouts or what happened to her that night, please provide us with this information and we will give this information to the police. 'We have heard that she left the nightclub with some English people. Please if you have heard, if you can imagine how I feel, how her mother feels, please give us some information about her.' Gunta's heartbreaking video appeal emerged hours after multi-millionaire property developer's son Westley Capper, 37, and pal Craig Porter, 33, were summoned to court on Monday in nearby Marbella. The pair, who are being investigated on suspicion of Agnese's illegal detention after a damning police report based on CCTV footage claimed she did not leave the club voluntarily, refused to answer questions about the case. A secrecy order imposed on the case was removed and a huge police file  released to the family's lawyer. Marbella-based judge Sergio Luis Martin indicated at Monday's hearing - which took place behind closed doors - that he would be happy to meet Agnese's family and brief them on his findings so far. Missing: Friends reported Agnese missing the week of her disappearance along with her mum and sister after they flew to Spain when she failed to respond to calls and messages . The judge is now expected to order new DNA tests on a human hair found inside the boot of the Mercedes privately-educated Capper has admitted to driving Latvian-born Agnese away from the club in. Samples taken from a motorboat belonging to Capper's family - which police fear may have been used to dispose of Agnese's body if she is dead - are also expected to be analysed using DNA from her mum. Overweight expat Capper - whose Essex-born dad John specialises in buying and selling luxury properties around the world - has had travel restrictions imposed on him while the investigation against him continues. He is claiming he dropped off Agnese, whose boyfriend Michael Millis is a former owner of west London club Westbourne Studios, near a flat she was staying at for the summer close to the home of former England manager Fabio Capello. Porter, from Liverpool, says he fell asleep on the back seat of the car they left the club in before the drop-off. Forensic experts were unable to discover who the hair in the boot of the car belonged to during during initial tests following a sweep of the vehicle. Agnese with British boyfriend Michael Millis, who travelled to Spain to help the search for the 30-year-old . The motorboat belonging to Capper's family was seized in a port in the province of Murcia, around 300 miles east of Marbella. It left a port in Fuengirola near Marbella days after Agnese vanished. A doorman at Aqwa Mist was initially arrested alongside the two current Brit suspects for allegedly obstructing police inquiries - but the case against him dropped after the trio took part in a police reconstruction of the last night Agnese was seen alive. The criminal inquiry is expected to become a homicide probe if new DNA tests show Agnese was in the boot of the car or on the motorboat. Neither suspect has yet been formally charged with any crime as is normal in Spain in the early stages of an investigation. Aqwa Mist is one of four Marbella venues owned by international restaurant brand La Sala, whose shareholders include ex-Tottenham Hotspurs winger David Bentley and defender Dean Austin.

Privately-educated Capper has admitted to driving Latvian-born Agnese away from the club . Footballer Ashley Cole is said to have spent £12,000 on champagne he then sprayed over his friends during a night out at the nightspot the summer before last. Hollywood star Eva Longoria, American actor and singer Terence Howard, and boxer Amir Khan have partied there since its opening in June 2012. The stars of BAFTA award-winning reality TV soap opera TOWIE are also summer regulars at the club, which bills itself as Marbella's number one party venue. Lawyers acting for the two Brits refused to comment as they left court. A court official confirmed: 'Both suspects declined to answer questions from the judge. 'The investigation is ongoing.' A source close to the case said: 'The judge has indicated he will order fresh DNA tests which may involve the use of Agnese's mum's DNA. 'He had important questions to ask the suspects and obviously would have preferred it if they had agreed to cooperate with his investigation.' Capper's dad, known to friends as Fred, has made a fortune from purchasing and selling luxury properties across the world. He has modernised and sold luxury villas in fortress estates like La Zagaleta near Marbella, home to some of the world's wealthiest people. One of his companies also boasts of assets including yachts and private jets. An acquaintance, who asked not to be named, described him as 'mega-rich' and said he owned his own private plane with his name on the tail plate. He is currently understood to be based in Gibraltar. The source said: 'Westley might not look like a multi-millionaire's son but he's never wanted for anything.' Agnese, a 5ft 7in blonde who had travelled to Marbella to start a summer job at the Ocean Club in Marbella, was wearing a multi-coloured halter neck dress and carrying a large white Louis Vuitton handbag when she left the club. Friends reported her missing the week of her disappearance, along with her mum and sister after they flew to Spain when she failed to respond to calls and messages and they discovered her clothes and bank cards were still at a nearby flat she was staying at. Her friends and relatives have put up missing posters around Marbella and the neighbouring resort of Puerto Banus in the hope of cracking the mystery. Agnese's friends and relatives have put up missing posters around Marbella and the neighbouring resort of Puerto Banus in the hope of cracking the mystery . Boyfriend Michael admitted at the time: 'The longer Agnese is missing the more pessimistic we are about ever seeing her alive again' They have also set up a Find Agnese Klavina Facebook page linked to a GoFundMe page to help raise funds for legal fees linked to the search. Agnese's mum Daiga, in an appeal for information about her daughter's whereabouts in February, said: 'We can't believe this is happening. 'It has now been nearly six months without our daughter - not knowing if she is still alive or where she may be. 'Please help us find our Agnese, our lives will never be the same if we don't see her again. 'If anyone has any information no matter how small, it could make a big difference to our efforts in finding her.' Boyfriend Michael admitted at the time: 'The longer Agnese is missing the more pessimistic we are about ever seeing her alive again. 'I think if she was going to be found safe and well she would have contacted someone close to her by now and she hasn't.'

"Single-serve coffee capsules in 2014 hit over $3 billion in US sales, it's been revealed. The finding was unveiled in a CBS News report by Susan Spencer on one such company that manufactures them, the Vermont-based Keurig Green Mountain. Speaking to Spencer, Keurig's chief technology officer Kevin Sullivan explained the appeal of his company's single-serve coffee machine is that users can 'Just close the handle and touch a button, and away it goes.' Scroll down for video . Success: Keurig's chief technology officer Kevin Sullivan has said that single-serve coffee has 'found the hidden need - the need that people didn't know they had' Keurig Green Mountain's single-serve capsules in 2014 hit over $3 billion in US sales . CBS News revealed that Keurig Green Mountain has proved highly successfully and made $4.7 billion in revenue. Among its many coffee flavors available, Keurig sells on its website Krispy Kreme, Starbucks, Folgers, Dunkin Donuts and Kahlua options. Prices vary, but 24-counts of single-serve coffee capsules - often simply referred to as K-Cups - usually have list prices between $15.49 and $17.99, with members paying slightly less. 'Single serve, I think, found the hidden need - the need that people didn't know they had,' Sullivan said during the interview. 1/3 of homes in the United States now feature single-serve coffee machines, CBS News reported. Spencer said in the interview 'A cup of coffee made this way is not necessarily cheap.' Sullivan answered 'It's less expensive than if you go to a coffee shop, but it's more expensive than if you bought a pound of coffee and did your drip grind.' Big hit: Keurig Green Mountain has also made $4.7 billion in revenue, and 1/3 of homes in the US reportedly feature single-serve coffee machines . Science: Keurig employees are seen with coffee equipment at the company's offices . At one point in the interview, Spencer posed the question 'So where is Keurig now in terms of making these things recyclable?' 'We've been hard at work to solve that problem,' Sullivan answered. 'We introduced a system called Vue that has cups that are, in fact, recyclable. 'We have a company objective that everything will be recyclable by the year 2020. We certainly aren't going to wait that long. I think we're going to start that much sooner, and hopefully convert sooner than that.' Keurig has said on its website that a new type of K-Cup is being created, and that 'we intend to move toward polypropylene (#5) plastic for the cup itself — a material often used in common household items, such as yogurt and butter containers.' The company said the material 'is [...] accepted by recyclers in approximately 60% of communities in the United States and 93% of communities in Canada.' According to Keurig, the company is 'working with the recycling community and other partners to develop a more robust recycling infrastructure that accepts #5 plastics in even more communities and that can consistently capture small items, such as our portion packs.'","Keurig Green Mountain's single-serve capsules in 2014 hit over $3 billion in US sales, it's been revealed .

"David Cameron will today warn English voters the SNP's new powers could impact their lives . David Cameron will today risk infuriating the SNP by vowing to conduct an annual review of the fairness of the Scottish government’s policies on the rest of the UK. A Conservative government would create a new principle to ensure decisions by Holyrood do not have an ‘unforeseen detrimental effect’ for people south of the border, he will say. The Prime Minister will tell voters in England that new powers for the Scottish Parliament mean it ‘can now have a big impact on your job, your income, and investment in your area’. Mr Cameron will call the idea the ‘Carlisle Principle’ – named to reflect the sort of border communities in the rest of the UK that could be particularly badly affected by decisions taken by the Scottish government. There has been growing resentment in England and Wales at the ‘apartheid’ between those living north and south of the border in areas such as healthcare and university fees. For instance, cancer drugs have been made available on the NHS in Scotland that are not prescribed elsewhere, meaning taxpayers in England and Wales are contributing to funding them, but not benefiting. The Scottish Parliament’s new powers to cut air passenger duty could lead to air travellers and airports in the north of England being unfairly disadvantaged – and require targeted tax cuts, Mr Cameron will say. However, Scottish Nationalists are likely to accuse Mr Cameron of wanting Westminster to ‘mark the Scottish Parliament’s homework’ every year. He will also be accused of seeking to stoke anti-Scottish sentiment in the rest of the UK – and throwing fuel on the fire of Scottish nationalism. The Tory manifesto promises to introduce a principle of ‘English votes for English laws’, meaning English MPs will be given a veto over legislation relating solely to England. Under Mr Cameron’s latest plan, a formal assessment would be made by the Treasury and Cabinet Office each year of the impact of Scottish policies, including tax rates, business levies, university tuition fees and healthcare. Mr Cameron risks the wrath of Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon (pictured above) with his announcement . The Chancellor will tell MPs ‘what action is needed to make sure there is no detriment to the rest of the country’. The Prime Minister, on a campaign visit to the North West, will insist the plan will not stop the Scottish government taking the decisions it wants. ‘In the Scottish referendum, we made a clear promise to devolve more powers to the Scottish Parliament,’ Mr Cameron will say. ‘After we won that referendum, we kept our promise, and agreement was reached – for the first time – between all five of Scotland’s major parties to give the Scottish Parliament extensive new powers. ‘But as we go further in devolving powers to Scotland, we need to make sure devolution works for all the other all parts of this country too. ‘Today I want to set out a new principle – you could call it the Carlisle Principle – that we will make sure that there are no unforeseen detrimental consequences to the rest of the country from Scottish devolution.’ Boris Johnson and Sir John Major will enter the election fray this week as the Tories try to bolster their campaign. Sir John will warn of the dangers of a Labour-SNP government. The ex-premier could be deployed to speak as early as tomorrow. Later in the week, David Cameron is due to make a first high-profile campaign appearance with Mr Johnson. There are growing calls from Tory MPs for the London mayor to be ‘weaponised’. David Cameron has revealed he is locked in a high stakes battle: over ear-piercing. While contesting a general election campaign, he is also in a 'fight' with eldest daughter Nancy about when she can have her ears pierced. The Prime Minister also admitted he does not want his children to follow wife Samantha in having tattoo. In an interview with the Sun, Mr Cameron said his children 'take the mickey out of me daily', including mocking his TV and music choices. 'To them I'm just a normal dad, who they think is a bit square and sometimes embarrassing. It's very sobering to come home to after a day in the office,' he said. 'They rib me about, you know, anything from my CD collection to what I watch on TV.' Nancy is due to start secondary school in September, and wants to have her ears pierced. Mr Cameron said: 'I'm in that fight with Nancy at the moment. We'll probably reach an agreement over what age she can have them done. We're in negotiations.' His wife Samantha has a small tattoo of a dolphin on her right ankle, which she had done while travelling as a student. She has said it would 'fine' if her children copied her. But Mr Cameron said: 'I'm not a big fan. I love Samantha's tattoo, it's very small, very discreet. But I'd be a square dad and tell the children to think very carefully about it.'","A Tory government would create a new principle to review SNP policies .

"With his arm around his little sister, both of them looking out at the blue water, it's an image that shows the unbreakable bond between a brother and sister. It is also an image that makes the fatal crash on a rain-soaked road all the more tragic - the devoted siblings died within hours of each other. Piper Kulk, 8, on the right of the family snap caption 'our babies', died on Sunday morning, hours after the accident on the NSW Central Coast, when the car being driven by their grandmother, Helen Boddy, 54, aqua-planed and swerved into the path of an oncoming ute. Piper's brother William, 9, on the left of the image, died in hospital on Sunday evening. Together with their older brother Daniel, 12, and mother Chantelle, 31, they had spent the day at the Royal Easter Show in Sydney and had just been picked up from a nearby train station by their grandmother. Daniel and Chantelle are still in hospital. Tributes have poured in for two siblings killed on their way home from the Royal Easter Show in Sydney . Nine-year-old William Kulk (left) and eight-year-old Piper Kulk (right) were both killed in the head-on crash . A relative posted the heartbreaking photo of William with has arm around Piper looking out at the water and more than $32,000 has already been raised online to help the devastated family after a Gofundme page was set up to cover the cost of their funerals. Both children attended Budgewoi Public School, where a floral memorial has been laid, and also played rugby league with the Budgewoi-Buff Point Bulldogs, the Daily Telegraph reports. It is believed Mrs Boddy's Holden Astra aqua-planed, spun out of control and ended up on the other side of the road when it collided with a ute. All three siblings were sitting in the back of the car when the accident occurred. A relative told The Daily Telegraph: ‘We’re just devastated.’ Piper Hulk, 8, died in the horrific accident near Doyalson in NSW Central Coast on Saturday . Warwick Milham got the call his wife and daughter had both been injured in the crash . Glenda Milham (left) suffered a fractured neck, while daughter, Michelle (right), had broken bones . The incident also left passengers in the ute involved in the accident on Wyee Road near Doyalson with severe injuries. Warwick Milham arrived at the scene after hearing his wife, Glenda, and daughter, Michelle, were involved. Glenda suffered a fractured neck while Michelle had broken bones. 'It was a horrendous scene. I wouldn't wish it upon anybody,' Mr Milham told 9News. The seven people involved in the crash were all trapped in the wreckage before being released from the two vehicles by emergency services. The two boys, Daniel and William, were airlifted to The Children's Hospital at Westmead and William later succumbed to his injuries. Daniel is now in a stable condition. Heavy rain caused a car containing two adults and three children to spin out of control, colliding with a ute . The seven people involved in the crash, which happened about 5.15pm on Saturday, were all trapped in the wreckage before being released from the two vehicles by emergency services . Wyee Road was closed for seven hours while Crash Investigation Unit police examined the scene. 'When you get behind the wheel you accept the risks that go with it and that includes the real possibility you will change your family's life or that of another family forever,' Assistant Commissioner John Hartley said at the weekend. 'As wet weather is expected to continue across the remainder of Easter – I am urging all road users to slow down, adjust to the conditions and leave more room than usual between your vehicle and the one in front of you.' Piper died on Sunday morning, while her brother William died later that night . All women sustained fractures in the crash and were taken to John Hunter Hospital. They are reported to be in stable conditions . The crash follows the death of a two-year-old girl on Friday when a ute rolled over in South Australia. A 33-year-old man died in another rollover incident in Western Australia the same day. A couple and their two young children also narrowly avoided an Easter tragedy after a head-on crash with an allegedly drunk driver in NSW's Hawkesbury region. A 29-year-old Stanhope Gardens man was travelling with his wife, two-year-old son and one-month-old daughter, when the crash happened in Webb's Creek on Friday afternoon. All four were uninjured, but all the airbags in the car deployed in the crash. The driver of the second car, a 54-year-old Lower Portland man who was also not hurt, returned a positive reading of 0.120. The man was later charged with mid-range drink-driving and driving an unregistered vehicle. He was issued a field court attendance notice to appear before Windsor Local Court on May 14.","Nine-year-old William Kulk died in hospital on Sunday night .

"Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia got off to a very dramatic start in Sydney on Sunday night, when the opening show was interrupted by a man who stormed the runway at the Ellery show. As designer Kym Ellery made her way down the catwalk to take her bow, a furious man understood to be a neighbour of the Carriageworks venue at Eveleigh made a very public complaint about the music. The local man was pictured covering his ears, wagging his finger, and shouting at a security guard who escorted him from the runway. Scroll down for video . Turn down that racket! A man stormed the runway  at Ellery's Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia show at Carriageworks in Sydney on Sunday night . Drama: The man, understood to be a neighbour of the Carriageworks venue, walked onto the runway while designer Kym Ellery was taking her bow . Disgruntled: The man was overheard to tell security that the music was a 'disgrace', and that show organisers had 'no respect for the local community' Angry: Eye witnesses tell Daily Mail Australia that 'dramatic' loud music boomed throughout the 15-minute show . Bass: Electronic music boomed throughout the space for the duration of the 15-minute show . Hardcore electronic music with a heavy bass line boomed throughout the space for the duration of the show, which lasted about 15 minutes. The man was reportedly overheard complaining that show organisers were showing little respect for the local community. 'The noise is way too loud, this is disgrace,' eye witnesses overheard him say, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. 'It was loud but it was all part of the dramatic vibe,' a guest at the Ellery show told Daily Mail Australia. The Australian designer wasn't fazed by the disruption, the eye-witness added. 'Kym ran out merrily at the end, aside from that it all went perfectly.' Escorted out: The man was removed from the venue by a security guard . Down in front! Ellery only walked down half the catwalk as the scuffle occurred at the other end . Unfazed: The Australian fashion designer threw her hands in the air and smiled widely, the room erupting into applause . Indeed the style-maker looked utterly triumphant as she ran onto the catwalk as the show came to an end. Appearing on the glitter-covered runway in an all-black ensemble of her own design, she threw her hands above her head and grinned as the room exploded into applause - doing nothing to reduce the noise levels. The room was packed with fashionistas on the opening night, many of them wearing looks from the beloved designer's latest collection. On a high: Kym made her entrance in one of her own ensembles . Return to the runway: The Ellery show was the first time Gemma Ward has walked at MBFWA since before her six-year hiatus from modelling .

"Jailed bigamist Andrew O'Clee, 36, may have been on the prowl for wife number three after a dating profile matching his description was discovered, pictured outside Chichester Crown Court . A bigamist caught out when his wife discovered on Facebook that he had secretly married his mistress may have been searching the internet for wife number three, it emerged yesterday. A web profile apparently matching that of ‘shameless liar’ Andrew O’Clee, 36, has been spotted on a dating site, where he claimed to be ‘looking for a relationship’. O’Clee led a double life, duping his first wife, Michelle, 39, into believing he needed to spend periods away from the family home in a ‘safe house’ because he was involved in a serious fraud trial. In reality, the former soldier was living a double life, romancing finance manager Philippa Campbell, 30, who he eventually married in a lavish wedding. His first wife uncovered his deception when she came across a Facebook video of the pair completing the ice bucket challenge – where people are filmed being drenched in cold water for charity. The post led her to photos of his second wedding, which she then reported to police. Michelle, who has been friends with singer Myleene Klass since the pair appeared in a production of Miss Saigon together in 1999, is currently seeking a divorce from O’Clee. She refused to comment yesterday, but friends said she felt ‘well and truly betrayed’ by her husband. And yesterday it emerged that the cheat may even have been looking for more women to romance after a dating profile for an ‘andrewoclee’ was uncovered on the Plenty of Fish website. Although it is unclear when the profile – which no longer includes a picture – was created, it matches his age and lists the user as living in London, where O’Clee and Michelle rented a flat. The profile, which no longer has a picture, describes a blue-eyed 'adventurer' who is 'looking for a relationship' O'Clee (middle) was jailed for eight months after his first wife Michelle (pictured left) exposed him as a cheat who was also married to Philippa Campbell (right) Mysteriously the profile, which also matches O’Clee’s 6ft 3in height and describes a blue-eyed ‘adventurer’ who is ‘looking for a relationship’, claims he has never had a relationship that lasted longer than a year. O’Clee, of Chiddingfold, Surrey, was jailed for eight months after admitting bigamy on Tuesday. A judge, sitting at Chichester Crown Court, told business services provider O’Clee that he had created an ‘absurd lie’ which had been ‘a selfish act’. Michelle, who married O’Clee in 2008, told the court she felt ‘stupid’ and ‘naive’ but had not doubted her husband. She even failed to worry when he turned up five hours late for the birth of their daughter, Amelia. By then he was already dating Miss Campbell, who he married in August 2013 at St John the Baptist church in Kirdford, West Sussex, near their detached £575,000 home. She has vowed to stay with him. He started the affair with Philippa (pictured together) after claiming his first marriage had ended after he caught shopworker Michelle being unfaithful .","Andrew O'Clee, 36, has been jailed after his second marriage was exposed .

"The 'coupon election' came in 1918, while critics branded the 1929 vote - when women first had full suffrage - the 'flapper election'. And, with just 23 days to go, the 2015 general election looks to be picking up a nickname of its own - the 'selfie election'. With less than four weeks until the ballot boxes open, politicians have been trying their best to get their faces in as many places as possible - literally - by posing relentlessly for the ubiquitous photos. Cheese: Keen to show he’s not out of touch, David Cameron poses for a selfie in Alnwick, Northumberland . Posing: Nick Clegg has also been getting in on the act with supporters in Maidstone, Kent . Grinning: Labour leader Ed Miliband poses for a selfie with staff during a campaign visit to Airedale Hospital maternity ward in Keighley, Yorkshire, on Saturday . Natural pose: Ukip leader Nigel Farage joins in with the craze on the campaign trail in South Ockenden, Essex . Conservative MPs were told at the start of the campaign to pose for 'selfies' as often as possible, to increase the party's exposure on social media websites, such as Facebook and Twitter. Since then, David Cameron has been seen donning cheesy grins on numerous occasions, as he poses beside voters during his country-wide visits. The PM, keen to show he is not out of touch, was seen posing for selfies during his visit to Alnwick, Northumberland, yesterday. But, as these images suggest, it appears the photo-taking craze has left no party untouched, with Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage  also getting in on the action at every opportunity. This week, Clegg and Farage were both spotted posing with fans on the streets of Maidstone, Kent, and South Ockendon, Essex, respectively. Meanwhile, the grinning Labour leader took took charge of his own selfie shot, as he posed with staff during a campaign visit to Airedale Hospital maternity ward in Keighley, Yorkshire, on Saturday. At it again: Farage also joined three girls for a selfie during a visit to Himley Hall, near Dudley, last week . Snap: Clegg poses with local Lib Dem candidate Tom Brake (right) for a selfie in Carshalton, London, today . Game face: Cameron agrees to pose beside a local man on the campaign trail. PR tsars have reportedly told the Tory party to try and pose for as many selfies as possible during the election campaign . Thumbs up: Farage gestures happily to the camera as he poses with a group in the Thanet South constituency . And, so far, the tactic appears to have worked. A quick search of 'selfie election' on Twitter brings up thousands of tweets, most of which feature the grinning face of one of the party leaders. Last month, a senior Tory source admitted the 2015 General Election could become known as 'the selfie election', as party leaders find themselves mobbed by voters on the campaign trail. The source added: 'It is actually more powerful because obviously they will show their friends, post on Facebook.' He said MPs were also being told to 'use social media as the means to deliver a message'. Taking the lead: Clegg is the one to press the button during this selfie with Lib Dem candidate for Montgomeryshire Jane Dodds and the family of Jackie Glynn during a visit to Newtown . Beer grin: Farage poses with a fan at the Thanet Beer Festival in Margate, Kent, earlier this month . In demand: He was asked several times to pose for a selfie during the packed-out beer festival . The technique was employed to perfection during the Scottish Referendum, with Alex Salmond often seen stopping to pose for selfies with Yes campaign supporters. At the time, Facebook revealed figures detailing more than 10 million interactions surrounding the referendum in a five-week period. A senior strategist for the Yes campaign said the social media site was the most effective campaigning tool available because it offers access to nearly every voter and allows individuals to spread the messages they want to hear. Do you need a hand? Cameron offers his advice to a supporter as he poses up for a selfie, while campaigning alonside local Conservative candidate Anne-Marie Trevelyan in Alnwick . Eddie Izzard takes a selfie with a man as he campaigns in support of Labour candidate for Finchley and Golders Green, Sarah Sackman, in Finchley, north London, last week . He's done this before: London Mayor Boris Johnson stops for a selfie in a shop in Brent Cross, north London .","Politicians have posed for as many selfies as possible on campaign trail .

"It was an idea that was never in danger of being poo-pooed. A Game Of Thrones ‘super-fan’ had a fully functional toilet built for him that’s an almost-identical replica of the Iron Throne that features in the hit TV show. While the throne on the show was forged from 200 swords melted by dragon breath at the order of Aegon the Conqueror, the first of the Targaryen Kings, the loo version was made using plywood by a team of top Hollywood prop makers for YouTube show Super Fan Builds. Scroll down for video . A loo version of the Iron Throne was built by a team of Hollywood prop makers . The Super Fan Builds team, led by master designer Tim Baker (pictured), used jigsaws, grinders and special paint that gives wood a metallic effect . Work in progress: Baker and his team pictured assembling their toilet Iron Throne . Baker gives viewers an update on progress. It took several days for the loo to be completed . Once finished it was presented to self-confessed Game Of Thrones geek John Giovanazzi and installed in the toilet of the bar he runs in Glendale, California. The show, hosted by actress Trisha Hershberger, specialises in building one-of-a-kind items for super-fans of comics, movies and games, according to its YouTube description, and in this instance the commission was requested by Giovanazzi’s friend Chloe Dykstra. She told the show: ‘He’s [Giovanazzi] a huge Game Of Thrones fan. He loves everything Game Of Thrones. He’s read all the books and marathoned the TV shows. He owns a bar called Complex, which is known for its nerd events. He’s thrown a bunch of Game Of Throne-themed parties. The recipient was self-confessed Game Of Thrones geek John Giovanazzi, who is pictured on his new loo at his bar in Glendale, California . Actor Sean Bean as Lord Eddard Stark in Game Of Thrones . ‘He even has Game Of Thrones beer on tap. You guys have to do something. Something epic. Maybe an Iron Throne as a toilet.’ The Super Fan Builds team, led by master designer Tim Baker, got to work using jigsaws, grinders and special paint that gives wood a metallic effect. The result drew an appreciative ‘wow’ from Giovanazzi. The creation came just as the much-anticipated fifth season of the show hit television screens.

"The will of Princess Diana is among 41 million available to order at the click of a button. Diana’s final wishes for the disposal of her £21.4 million estate are among a vast archive of wills dating back to 1858 now available to view online. Those of Winston Churchill and George Orwell can also be seen. In her will, Diana’s butler Paul Burrell was bequeathed the sum of £50,000, free of inheritance tax. Scroll down for video . The will of Princess Diana is among 41 million available to order at the click of a button thanks to a new service . Possessions including paintings and a clock were distributed among her 17 godchildren, while the rest went to her sons William and Harry. Qadir Ahmed runs the secure Iron Mountain facility in a leafy suburb of Birmingham where row upon row of the documents are kept in temperature-controlled storage, under tight security. He said the wills are a fascinating snapshot into the personalities and characters of people from every walk of life. For some, having a copy of a will is a matter of sentimentality, whereas others - particularly in the case of celebrities - are ordered out of 'pure curiosity', he said. 'We have 41 million in storage and there are so many fascinating and emotional stories,' said Mr Ahmed. One such is that of the late Paul Hunter, the champion snooker player, who died of cancer in 2006 aged just 27. Paul Burrell was given £50,000 by Diana when she died . The Yorkshireman fathered a daughter who, at the time he penned his will, was not yet born but she is remembered in the passages of his will, as Mr Ahmed describes. 'There are some really touching stories inside these files - people like Paul Hunter, who in his will says 'To my unborn child, I leave ...' and that is genuinely touching. 'He believed at the time he was writing this will, that he wouldn't survive the birth of his child.' 'You feel the emotion of that moment, through reading the record.' The first disbursement of Diana's will reads: 'I bequeath to my butler Paul Burrell the sum of £50,000, free of inheritance tax.' It also provides for specified keepsakes including watercolour paintings and a carriage clock to be distributed among her 17 godchildren, while to Princes William and Harry she left everything else. In the event of her death she makes express provision the Prince of Wales 'will consult with my mother [Frances Shand Kydd] with regard to the upbringing, education and welfare of our children'. She also makes clear her wish to be buried. Mr Ahmed said the new system, which has been in place since the end of last year, means people no longer have to order wills by post, or by heading to their local Registry Office. 'A lot of the public are not aware these are public records,' he said. 'Once someone goes through probate, that's it. It's a simple process, through the gov.uk website. 'You can pay a small fee of £10 and order a record of anyone who's gone through probate, searching by the person's name and year of death.' Among the other celebrity wills, are those of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill, creator of Winnie the Pooh AA Milne and George Orwell - under his real name Eric Blair - who penned 1984. Data centre manager Qadir Ahmed inspects one of the more than 41 million public wills held in secure storage at the Iron Mountain facility in Birmingham . Churchill, who died in 1965, left an estate worth £266,054 which he asked to be divided between his wife and children. He gave his country home Chartwell, in Kent, to the National Trust to be a museum after his death. As well as other bequests of cash to his wife, children, family and friends, he also left money to his employees, including £100 for his gardener. His son-in-law, Arthur Christopher John Soames, was given 'such of my brood mares, followers and fillies' from Churchill's stable, but with the caveat his choices were ""not exceeding three in number, nor £7,500 in total value'. Also stored away is the will of wartime code-breaker Alan Turing, recently played in Hollywood movie The Imitation Game by Benedict Cumberbatch. Turing's brief final testament directs his possessions be left to close friends and his mother. Meanwhile, Orwell - listed under his birth name Blair - left instructions 'no biography be written' and 'no memorial service be held for me after my death'.","Diana's will is among those stored in an archive which is to be put online .

"A council has been slammed for ripping up more than 12,000 cobbles from a historic road so it can relay them to make it a smoother surface for cyclists. Cobbles on the road, which runs alongside the Bristol Floating Harbour and dates back to the 19th century, will be lifted from their current place and cut in half before being relaid again. The council tested the technique on a small patch of paving and said the reaction had been 'overwhelmingly' in support for the scheme from cyclists, pedestrians and wheelchair users. The cobbles will be lifted from their current place, cut in half and then relaid again to make the surface smoother for cyclists . The history of the area dates back to May 1809 when 83 acres of the tidal River Avon was impounded to keep ships in the port of Bristol afloat at all times. Maggie Shapland, a member of the Bristol Industrial Archaeological Society, has questioned what the work will do to the appearance of the historic harbourside. She said: '12,000 cobbles have been lifted. They are being cut in half and re-laid so that there is a flat surface. The history of the area dates back to the 19th century when Bristol Floating Harbour was built . 'It has apparently been requested by the cyclists despite the fact that it is a harbourside walk and not a designated cyclist route. 'This is a massive job, must have cost a fortune since the cobbles are hard to cut and will totally change the appearance of the area.' The work is part of the council's and the Cycling Ambition Fund's overall vision of making the city more attractive for users. Ms Shapland added that the area is Grade II listed, and she did not believe the council had obtained the proper permission before starting the work. She said: 'They have not applied for listed building consent, so there has been no consultation.' A spokesperson for Bristol City Council said: 'The changes do not require planning consent or other permissions. 'Before starting the work, we tested a small area of cobbles behind the Olive Shed and received overwhelming support from people in favour of the technique. The spokesperson added that the work was being carried out to improve the surface of the road for pedestrians and wheelchair users as well as cyclists. She said: 'We are making some adjustments to the cobbles in these streets to improve the surface for pedestrians, cyclists, wheelchair users, people suffering from arthritis and many others. 'The work is part of the Cycling Ambition Fund and the council's vision to improve road surfaces across the city in order to make Bristol more attractive to walk and cycle in.'

"The Post Office failed to properly investigate why money had gone missing from branches before launching court proceedings against subpostmasters, a report revealed yesterday. Many were sacked, stripped of their savings and even jailed after cash shortfalls were recorded at some branches – despite claims that a faulty IT system was to blame. The Post Office asked forensic accountants Second Sight to investigate the Horizon IT system in 2012, following complaints from dozens of subpostmasters who said they had been wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting when cash shortfalls were discovered. The Post Office failed to properly investigate why money had gone missing from branches before launching court proceedings against subpostmasters, a report has revealed (file picture) Now a leaked copy of the accountants’ independent report has suggested that the discrepancies could have been caused by computer failures, cyber criminals or human error. It also accused the Post Office of failing ‘in many cases’ to identify ‘the root cause of shortfalls’ before starting civil or criminal proceedings. The review said some criminal cases brought by the Post Office were ‘motivated primarily’ by a desire to recover the money and did not appear to be supported by sufficient evidence. It went on to claim that the Post Office had failed to provide the accountancy firm with the documentation they required, and had ‘terminated’ their contract before they finished their research. The report has sparked fresh calls for a full independent inquiry into the computer system used by postmasters after the report reported concerns that ‘in some circumstances Horizon can be systemically flawed’. Former Conservative MP James Arbuthnot said some subpostmasters had been 'dragged through the mud' Former Conservative MP James Arbuthnot, who led an MPs’ campaign to support the subpostmasters, said: ‘These people have been pillars of the community who had their reputations dragged through the mud – some have been sent to prison, they’ve been made bankrupt, they’ve had contracts terminated, I understand at least one has committed suicide. And the way they have been treated is an utter disgrace. I think there needs to be an independent inquiry.’ Responding to the report, the Post Office said the review had repeated ‘complaints made by a very small number of former postmasters, as well as a number of assertions and opinions’ – but had not offered any new evidence to support the claims. They pointed out that they have received 150 complaints about the IT system since it opened a complaints system two years ago, a number they said represents a ‘tiny fraction’ of the 500,000 people who had used the system ‘effectively’. A spokesman said: ‘In none of Post Office’s own work, nor through any of Second Sight’s work, has any information emerged to suggest that a conviction is unsafe.’ But Andy Furey, of the Communication Workers Union, said: ‘This is another damning report which reiterates the serious concerns of many postmasters. Part of the problem throughout has been the bullish behaviour of the Post Office towards postmasters who feel that they are helpless victims of a computer system gone wrong.’ Sacked: Subpostmaster Michael Rudkin, 57 . A subpostmaster was pursued to the brink of ruin and his wife left contemplating suicide after being prosecuted by the Post Office. Michael Rudkin, 57, believes action was taken against him after he allegedly discovered that data in branches could be altered remotely – potentially explaining mystery cash shortfalls. The day after Mr Rudkin expressed concern at the revelation, a Post Office auditor turned up at his shop in Ibstock, Leicestershire, to tell him £44,000 was unaccounted for. ‘My world was turned upside down,’ he said, adding: ‘I became like a drowning man with no life raft.’ Despite insisting he never saw a penny of the ‘missing’ funds, Mr Rudkin was forced to repay the money and his wife Susan, 60, who did most of the day-to-day running of the branch, was prosecuted and given a suspended prison sentence. Mr Rudkin had his contract terminated while his wife was left ‘contemplating suicide’ after her conviction.","The Post Office failed to properly investigate why money went missing .

"A recent college graduate diagnosed with genital herpes is stepping into the limelight in attempt to destigmatize STIs. Ella Dawson, a recent graduate of Wesleyan University who resides in New York City, was diagnosed with herpes two years ago and says she's been dropping the 'herpes bomb' about six months after she had her first outbreak. In her essay for Women's Health Mag, Dawson recalls meeting a boy at a party who offered her a sip of his beer. I have herpes: Ella Dawson has genital herpes and she is sharing her story so that less people with the virus can feel the guilt and shame that sometimes accompanies the common skin condition . 'Don’t worry,' she remembers him saying. 'I don’t have herpes or anything.' His words hit a sore spot for her and she felt compelled to share her sexual health status. '""That’s funny,’ I said, with as warm a smile as I could manage. ‘Yeah, that’s really funny. Because I have genital herpes.’ His face crumbled. Not because I grossed him out — I could practically see the wheels turning in his brain as he realized he’d made an ignorant joke at someone else’s expense. The guy started apologizing profusely,""' she wrote in her essay. Dawson said that even though herpes is often the bud of the joke in popular culture, it's a real issue affecting at least one in six Americans. Dawson said that she felt empowered after telling someone she had herpes because it humanized the STI in a way that made it less of a stigma. 'I had seen in the flesh what a simple ""I have herpes"" could do when said fearlessly, without shame,' she wrote. 'Because when a real person — a woman you know and respect — casually mentions having herpes, it stops being a punchline and starts being someone's reality.' Don't strain: Dawson says that people who have herpes should not feel 'dirty or wrong' and should be aware that the virus is manageable and more common than people would expect . According to the CDC about 17 per cent of people ages 14-19 have genital herpes caused by HSV2. That percentage is only of people who choose to get tested and the actual number of people who have the virus is likely much higher. Even having sex with a condom does not protect someone from the highly contagious virus that only needs skin to skin contact to spread, even if there are no sores present. The Washington Post reports that according to an advocacy group called Project Accept Herpes didn't become a stigma until after the 1970s. '[Herpes] was merely a cold sore in an unusual place until the 1970s,' the group says on their web site. Dr. Peter Anthony Leone, medical director of the North Carolina HIV/STD Prevention and Control Branch told The Washington Post that the stigmatization of the virus was fueled by conservatives after the 'free love era.' Courage: Ella Dawson has the courage to tell people about  her virus because it will humanize the problem for sufferers worldwide . 'Herpes was seen as this marker of being promiscuous or bad or evil,' he said. 'But unless you’re in a mutually monogamous relationship with someone who has never had sex, you’re at risk.' Leone said that the sex scare campaign was both emotionally traumatizing and also gave false information about the virus. A study in the Journal of Health Psychology conducted in 2011 found several survey respondents with STIs reported feelings like 'less of a person.' Leone said that safe sex is very important but that herpes is not merely a sexual condition but it primarily a skin condition. 'The way you remove stigma is by bringing something to light,' he said. 'We need a push coming at the federal level to talk about sex in terms of health and move away from the disease model. Sex should be seen as part of being an adult, a healthy thing you can do and just part of your routine healthcare.' Dawson told the Washington Post that she will continue to blog about the virus and her dealings with it. She said that ever since her article on herpes was published she has received several emails from people around the world sharing their own story. Don't sit in the dark: Ellas Dawson says that people should communicate openly about herpes since so many people have it .","Ella Dawson, 22, a recent graduate of Wesleyan is revealing her genital herpes status in an attempt to destigmatize the STI .

"A bizarre tale of torture and amnesia is set to unfold in a Queensland court on Monday. The case involves a man from central Queensland who has been charged with torture, after another man went to hospital suffering fractures, head injuries and burns. Officers arrested a 32-year-old man from suburban Kepnock who will appear at Bundaberg Magistrates Court on Monday on charges including grievous bodily harm, deprivation of liberty and torture. On Saturday a 29-year-old man was admitted to Bundaberg Hospital (pictured) suffering from fractures, head injuries and burns . An investigation was launched on Saturday when a 29-year-old man went to Bundaberg Hospital. Initial police inquiries were to do with the theft of the man’s car. However, after observing his injuries at the hospital, police started their own investigation despite the victim claiming to have amnesia and that he could not remember what happened to him. Police claim that the offences took place between March 20 to March 27. The victim was taken to hospital on March 28, with burns to 15 per cent of his body. The 32-year-old accused from suburban Kepnock is due to appear at Bundaberg Magistrates Court (pictured) on Monday . ‘The man reported to police on Saturday that his vehicle had been stolen,’ a Queensland police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia. ‘Police then went to the hospital to make inquiries about that when they saw his injuries and commenced further investigations. ‘The victim is claiming to have amnesia. That’s what he told police, but they were able to charge the other man because they had solid evidence. While in Bundaberg Hospital (pictured) the victim claimed to be suffering from amnesia .

The video, uploaded by his mother Erin to Facebook in the wake of the announcement, sees the would-be candidate repeatedly state his ambition to ascend to the nation's highest office so he could 'play... with toys'. He eventually concedes that playtime is not the top priority of a Commander-in-Chief, but is still adamant that he is up to the task. Unfortunately, Zeke appears not to have realized that the U.S. Constitution prohibits anybody from holding the presidency until they are 35. However, unperturbed, he eventually takes his mother's advice and decides to run for presidency anyway. Zeke admittedly lacks the campaigning experience of Clinton, who already has to her name a period as Secretary of State, a spell in the U.S. Senate and eight years as First Lady. But he does have the advantage of youth over 67-year-old Clinton, and, unlike his more experienced rival, will not be perceived as a political insider. Accepting Ms Celello's campaign advice, he repeats: 'I'm Zeke and I'm running for president.' While he has yet to articulate a policy platform, the youngster is clearly not short on ambition.","Zeke Celello was devastated by Clinton campaign and burst into tears .

"A former Florida State University student has filed a lawsuit against top NFL prospect Jameis Winston, claiming he assaulted and raped her at an off-campus apartment in 2012. The lawsuit by Erica Kinsman, which seeks damages from the former Seminoles quarterback, was filed two weeks before the April 30 NFL draft. Winston could be selected as the first overall pick. Winston has denied the allegations and prosecutors declined to file charges against him in late 2013. He also was cleared by the university following a two-day student conduct hearing last year. The hearing was held to determine whether Winston violated four sections of the code of conduct - two for sexual misconduct and two for endangerment. Scroll down for video . Former Florida State University student Erica Kinsman filed a civil lawsuit against top NFL prospect Jameis Winston, saying he assaulted and raped her at an off-campus apartment in 2012 . Former FSU quarterback and Heisman winner Winston has denied the allegations and prosecutors declined to file charges against him in late 2013 . But John Clune, a lawyer for Kinsman, said in a statement there are consequences for Winston's behavior 'and since others have refused to hold him accountable, our client will.' 'Erica hopes to show other survivors the strength and empowerment that can come from refusing to stay silent no matter what forces are against you,' Clune said. December 7, 2012 - Erica Kinsman files a police report claiming she was raped, though she can not identify the attacker. January 10, 2013 - She tells Tallahassee police she recognizes Winston as the assailant in a class and hears a professor call his name. November 13, 2013 - Prosecutor Willie Meggs is notified of the allegations and pushes police on an investigation, during which key witnesses are interviewed and evidence is sought. November 2013 - Kinsman drops out of FSU, later claiming she received death threats for claiming she was raped by Winston. December 5, 2013 - Meggs decides against pursuing criminal charges, saying that evidence is insufficient. December 14, 2013 - Winston wins the Heisman Trophy, becoming the youngest player, at 19, to do so. January 6, 2014 - Winston and the Seminoles win the BCS championship against Auburn. December 21, 2014 - FSU clears Winston of any code of conduct violations after hearing presided over by retired Florida Supreme Court Justice Major Harding. He added: 'Jameis Winston in contrast has proven time and time again to be an entitled athlete who believes he can take what he wants. 'He took something here that he was not entitled to and he hurt someone. Kinsman told her alleged sexual assault story publicly in a documentary titled The Hunting Ground, which casts a critical eye on the role that fraternities, athletic departments and schools play in rape investigations on campus. Kinsman fights tears as she details her account of the December 2012 night, when as a freshman, she remembers running into a man at a Tallahassee Potbelly's, according to the Daily Beast. She says someone was creepily following her around the bar throughout the night and only stopped when a second man put his arm around her and told the pursuer he was her boyfriend. Kinsman claims that man then bought her a shot, after which she began to feel dizzy, although she faintly recalls taking a cab to an apartment. She says the next thing she remembers is coming to while the man on top of her, penetrating her, and claims that she asked him to stop. The man allegedly ignored both her and his roommate, who Kinsman says entered the room, when they told him to stop. He then took her into the bathroom, Kinsman said. There, she says, he raped her while he held her head against the tiles, and when he was finished told her, 'You can leave now.' Not knowing where the apartment was, Kinsman says she took an offer for a ride on the man's scooter back to a location she recognized, fearing what would happen if he knew where she lived. Kinsman's lawsuit, which goes into detail about the 2012 incident, accuses Winston of rape, assault, false imprisonment and emotional distress . Winston has avoided criminal charges, and a Florida State University conduct code hearing found there was not enough evidence to determine whether he was guilty . According to a New York Times investigation of the ensuing police investigation, Kinsman reported the assault in the early morning immediately after it happened, but did not identify the assailant. Tallahassee Police Officer Scott Angulo wrote he 'had no real leads' until Kinsman contacted police a month later, saying she saw the man in class and heard his name called, identifying him as Winston. The lawsuit, which goes into detail about the 2012 incident, accuses Winston of rape, assault, false imprisonment and emotional distress. Because the burden of proof is much lower in a civil lawsuit than in a criminal case, Kinsman could have a better chance of winning a jury verdict if it goes to trial. David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in Miami, said in a civil case the standard amounts to the 'greater weight' of the evidence, or 'merely tipping the scales in favor of the plaintiff.' In a criminal case, prosecutors must prove a person's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, meaning jurors must be entirely convinced of guilt. Kinsman dropped out of FSU after the incident, later claiming she received death threats for claiming she was raped by Winston . A month after prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence to pursue criminal charges, Winston led the Seminoles to a comeback victory against Auburn in the BCS title game . 'The scales have to be tipped all the way over to the side of the prosecution,' said Weinstein, who is not involved in the case. Weinstein also said that he thought Kinsman's chances of prevailing were good, based on the detailed allegations and multiple witness statements in the lawsuit. But that doesn't mean it will be easy. 'The defense will drag her character through the mud, so this is going to be an unpleasant process for her,' he said. 'However, Winston has a lot to lose, so I foresee a settlement and not a trial.' Kinsman has also filed a lawsuit against FSU's trustees, asserting that university officials had knowledge of her alleged sexual harassment and discrimination by the star quarterback and this created a hostile educational environment for her. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, including reimbursement for tuition, damages for emotional pain and suffering and loss of past and present earning and earning capacity. Lawyers for the university's board of trustees contend the lawsuit should be dismissed because it does not show that FSU was responsible for her harassment, but they also maintain that they offered her assistance. Kinsman's story was featured in the documentary film The Hunting Ground, which is an expose on the way fraternities, athletic departments and universities affect rape investigations .","Erica Kinsman filed lawsuit seeking damages from the former quarterback .

"Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Thursday demanded that all sanctions on Iran be lifted at the same time as any final agreement with world powers on curbing Tehran's nuclear program is reached. Khamenei, the Islamic Republic's most powerful figure and who has the last say on all state matters, was making his first comments on the interim deal reached last week in the Swiss city of Lausanne. In remarks apparently meant to keep hardline loyalists in line, he warned about 'deceptive' intentions of the United States. Reuters reported that the crowd chanted 'Death to America!' during the speech. 'Instant annulment of all sanction is one of the demands of our officials,' Khamenei said in a speech broadcast live on state television,' according to translations published by Reuters and the nonprofit Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But he hedged on whether there will be a deal in place at all by the June 30 deadline. 'I neither support nor oppose the deal, since nothing has happened yet,' he said. 'All the trouble arises when the details will be discussed; it may be that the deceptive other side wants to restrict us in the details.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . NO DEAL: Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Thursday that nothing is final and Iran will continue to insist on a complete withdrawal of sanctions . Khamenei tweeted his dismissal of what the White House claimed Tehran had agreed to . His stand on the lifting of sanctions matched earlier comments by President Hassan Rouhani, who said 'we will not sign any agreement, unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal.' These include nuclear-related United Nations resolutions as well as U.S. and EU nuclear-related economic sanctions. 'All #sanctions should be removed just when the deal is reached,' Khamenei tweeted later. 'If sanctions removal depends on another process then why [have] we started to talk?' A senior Israeli defense official said in a radio interview after the speech that Iran could still obtain a nuclear weapon if sanctions were lifted immediately, and would have more money to spend on arming regional proxies. 'The moment the sanctions are removed, tens of billions [of dollars] will flow to their coffers,' Amos Gilad predicted. 'They will get rich. They will have the power to support the entire network of missiles and rockets.' The U.S. State Department on Thursday repeated its position that sanctions against Iran would be removed gradually. 'Under the agreed-upon parameters, sanctions will be suspended in a phased manner upon verification that Iran has met specific commitments,' State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said during a daily press briefing. 'We're not going to respond to every public statement made by Iranian officials,' Rathke said, 'or negotiate in public.' State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke held firm, saying 'sanctions will be suspended in a phased manner upon verification that Iran has met specific commitments' One of those statements, from Khamenei, accused the White House of misleading the world with its claims of what was in the framework agreed to in Switzerland. 'Americans put out a statement just a few hours after our negotiators finished their talks ... this statement, which they called a ""fact sheet,"" was wrong on most of the issues,' Khamenei said during his speech. 'In most regards,' he claimed, it 'was faulty, incorrect and contrary to the substance of the negotiations.' In the U.S., Omri Ceren, press director at The Israel Project, told Daily Mail Online that Tehran has a good chance of winning a tug-of-war over what Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif actually agreed to. 'The Iranians have a 100 per cent record of forcing the Americans to bow to their interpretation whenever there's a dispute over Iranian concessions publicly declared by the Obama administration, including and specifically on fact sheets,' Ceren said Thurdsay. 'There's a good reason why Congress is increasingly worried, even as American negotiators assure them that they're telling the truth.' Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Daily Mail Online that up-front lifting of sanctions is a bad idea that might be put into practice anyway. 'A gradual lifting of sanctions in return for each step taken by Tehran is the only way to secure Tehran's cooperation in the future,' Alfoneh said. 'We are also concerned the Obama administration is so desperate for a nuclear deal, that Washington will give more concessions to Tehran,' he added.' Secretary of State John Kerry played a major role in nuclear negotiations that some observers now say are unraveling quickly . Khamenei claimed Thursday that the White House had lied about the substance of talks in Switzerland . Another area in which the parties seem to disagree is the question of monitoring and access to Iran's nuclear sites. While Kerry and Obama have emphasized expectations that Iran will let International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors tour and inspect their facilities at any time, Khamenei threw cold water on the idea. 'Any unconventional inspection or monitoring which would make Iran into a special case,' he said Thursday, 'would not be acceptable.' 'Foreign monitoring on #Iran's security isn’t allowed,' he added on Twitter. Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehqan also told the state-run FARS news agency on Thursday that Iran had not agreed to let international inspectors enter its nuclear facilities, which are typically enclosed on military installations. Ali Alfoneh of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said his group is 'concerned the Obama administration is so desperate for a nuclear deal, that Washington will give more concessions to Tehran' 'No such agreement has been made,' Dehquan said. 'Principally speaking, visit to military centers is among our redlines and no such visit will be accepted.' Khamenei and Rouhani spoke during a ceremony on Thursday marking Iran's National Day of Nuclear Technology. 'Our goal in the talks is to preserve our nation's nuclear rights,' Rouhani said. 'The Iranian nation has been and will be the victor in the negotiations.' The U.S. and EU sanctions have choked off nearly 1.5 million barrels of Iranian exports per day since early 2012, reducing its daily oil exports by 60 percent to around 1 million barrels. The tentative accord was a step towards a settlement that would allay Western fears that Iran could build an atomic bomb, with economic sanctions on Tehran being lifted in return. Negotiators from Iran, the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China will resume negotiations in the coming days to pave the way for a final deal. Since relations with Washington collapsed after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, enmity towards the United States has always been a rallying point for Iranian hardliners. 'I was never optimistic about negotiating with America... nonetheless I agreed to the negotiations and supported, and still support, the negotiators,' Khamenei said, . 'I support a deal that preserves the interests and honor of Iran.' The United States and its Western allies say it is vital that Iran fully cooperate with a U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) investigation into past nuclear activities that could be related to making weapons. Israeli defense official Amos Gilad predicted that when Iranian sanctions are dropped, 'they will get rich' and 'will have the power to support the entire network of missiles and rockets' Khamenei is now saying no foreign inspectors, including those from the IAEA, will be allowed to tour the military facilities where Iran's nuclear operations are housed . Khamenei ruled out any 'extraordinary supervision measures' over Iran's nuclear activities. 'Iran's military sites cannot be inspected under the excuse of nuclear supervision,' he said. A final deal would require a vigorous monitoring framework to ensure Iranian compliance. The negotiators have been working out a monitoring mechanism that would involve the IAEA. This has not been considered a sticking point in the nuclear talks. France, which has demanded more stringent conditions on Iran, said the comments by the Iranian leadership showed that reaching a final deal would be difficult and that in any case there would need to be a mechanism in place to restore sanctions if Tehran violated its commitments. 'Subjects still remain that we aren't agreed on, notably on economic sanctions, and the Supreme Leader has made statements that show there is still a lot of work to be done,' Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told lawmakers. 'We are going to keep the position we have held from the beginning, which is constructive but extremely demanding,' Fabius said. Khamenei also said the tentative deal did not guarantee reaching a comprehensive deal by a June 30 deadline. 'What has been achieved so far does not guarantee a deal or even that the negotiations will continue to the end,' Khamenei said, adding that an extension of the deadline should not be a problem. He then reiterated Iranian denials that Tehran was seeking to build a nuclear weapon.","Iran's president Hassan Rouhani assured the crowd that 'the Iranian nation has been and will be the victor in the negotiations'

"On trial: Former Ukip MEP Ashley Mote (pictured arriving at London's Southwark Crown Court today) is accused of a string of fraud-related offences . A former Ukip MEP fraudulently claimed almost £500,000 in European Parliament expenses - using some of it to fund his domestic court battles, a court heard today. Ashley Mote, 79, of Binsted, Hampshire, is accused of a string of fraud-related offences including acquiring criminal property and obtaining a money transfer by deception. Some of the money he allegedly made from the fraud went towards funding various legal costs he had built up as a result of being prosecuted in the UK for benefit fraud offences, a jury at London's Southwark Crown Court was told. He denies 11 offences alleged to have taken place between November 2004 and July 2010. Jonathan Davies, prosecuting, said that as an MEP, Mote could claim expenses, including a Parliamentary Assistance Allowance, or Secretarial Allowance, to help fund his work. Mr Davies said: ‘What the prosecution say happened between 2004 and 2009, when Mr Mote ceased to be an MEP, is that he abused that allowance by submitting false claims for payment for work which he said to the European Parliament had been done by organisations working on his behalf.’ Jurors heard that two of the organisations had previously campaigned against UK membership of the European Union. They were the Better Off Out Fund (Boof), and Direct Action Resistance To Tyranny (Dartt). However, it is alleged that neither of these companies conducted any work for Mote, who made claims of £16,000 against Boof, and £54,000 to Dartt. ‘They were simply used as a front to perpetrate, carry out fraud and to receive monies from the European Parliament,’ said Mr Davies. European Parliament in Brussels: Prosecutors claim Mote was 'using European Parliament money to fund his defence and various appeals in connection with being prosecuted for benefit fraud' Mote is also said to have falsely claimed £5,000 a month for work he claimed had been carried out by Estonia based company Icos (Information Centrum Owned State). It is alleged that he even set up a Danish bank account under the similar name of ‘Information Centrim OS’ for funds from the European Parliament to be paid into, ‘dishonestly obtaining’ approximately €355,000. Giving details of Mote carrying out fraud to fund his rising legal bills, Mr Davies said: ‘He asked for payments to be made to the firm of solicitors on the basis that they were providing him with advice in relation to his duties as an MEP. ‘In fact the money was being used to fund a number of criminal and civil proceedings related to Mr Mote's prosecution for benefit fraud offences, and indeed some unrelated civil proceedings. ‘Basically we say he was using European Parliament money to fund his defence and various appeals in connection with being prosecuted for benefit fraud.’ Mr Davies continued: ‘This was a sophisticated fraud committed over several years during which Mr Mote made a number of false representations and produced a number of false documents in order to deceive the European Parliament into believing that significant amounts of work were being done on his behalf, relating to his work as an MEP. Pleading not guilty: Mote (pictured again today) allegedly fraudulently claimed almost £500,000 in expenses . ‘In total he dishonestly obtained approximately €355,000 and £184,000 of allowances to which he was not entitled. It's not quite half a million pounds, but it's not far short.’ Jurors heard that while MEPs were allowed to make certain legitimate claims for expenses from the European Parliament, they were not supposed to use this money to enrich themselves. Between 2004, when he was elected MEP and 2009, Mote claimed a total of £750,000 in Parliamentary Assistance Allowance, taking into account his legitimate claims and any alleged fraudulent activity. Mote was elected a Ukip MEP for South East England in 2004, but shortly before he actually took up his seat was thrown out of Nigel Farage's party because he was being prosecuted by the Department for Work and Pensions for benefit fraud. However, he sat as an independent MEP until 2009, when he decided not to stand for election. The court heard that in April 2004 Mote's case for alleged income support, council tax and housing benefit fraud was sent to crown court to be dealt with, and he was elected as an MEP two months later. Elected as MEP: Mote (pictured in 2006) was thrown out of Ukip because he was being prosecuted by the Department for Work and Pensions for benefit fraud . But he made an application to the court saying that the criminal proceedings against him were a breach of his rights to free movement, as his bail conditions meant he could not travel freely to Europe. The courts agreed with this and proceedings against Mote were stayed, prompting the prosecution to make an application to the Attorney General to review the matter. Jurors heard that in light of this, Mote wrote to the manager of European Parliament allowances asking for expenses to allow him to fight this. He wrote: ‘I have to fund myself in the legal affairs committee against an attempt by the British government to unseat me as an MEP. This is going to incur legal costs.’ However, Mr Davies told the court that Mote did not disclose that he was being prosecuted for fraud. He said: ‘What Mr Mote doesn't say is something along the lines of “I am being prosecuted for fraud arising out of events prior to being elected as an MEP”.’ Jurors heard that the Attorney General overturned the decision and Mote was prosecuted and convicted of benefit fraud in August 2007. Mote denies four counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, three of false accounting, two of fraud, and one each of acquiring criminal property and concealing criminal property. The trial resumes at 10am tomorrow when the opening will continue.

"Teachers can judge the behaviour of black students more harshly than while pupils, new research has suggested. A study by researchers at Stanford University examined the reaction of secondary and primary school teachers in the United States to student race. They found that the teachers were more likely to view youngsters who they thought were black as troublemakers than those they thought were white. Teachers tend to see black pupils as more likely to cause trouble in the future if they have misbehaved in the past, according to new research that attempted to examine the impact of racial stereotypes in US schools . The researchers say this may go someway towards explaining why black children are often disciplined more at schools compared to other pupils. Professor Jennifer Eberhardt, a psychologist at Stanford University, said: 'The fact that black children are disproportionately disciplined in school is behind dispute. 'What is less clear is why. We see that stereotypes not only can be used to allow people to interpret a specific behavior in isolation, but also stereotypes can heighten our sensitivity to behavioral patterns across time. Some of the world’s most troubling times, which have included periods of intense racism, have occurred during economic downturns. And now a new study has found that people really do have a tendency to become more racist during a recession. Researchers found that faces seem ‘blacker’ and have stronger racial features during an economic downturn, and this in turn increases the likelihood of discrimination. The study by New York University claims that conditions of ‘resource scarcity’ alter people’s perception of race. Their work follows a study last year, which suggested racism is on the rise in the UK, fuelled by financial strife. In four experiments, involving 285 non-black Americans, scientists David Amodio and Amy Krosch found people see faces different during an economic downturn. 'This pattern sensitivity is especially relevant in the schooling context.' In their study, which is published in the journal Psychological Science, Professor Eberhardt and her colleagues presented teachers with fictional school records. These records described two instances of misbehaviour by a student. The teachers were asked about their perception of the severity, how irritated that misbehaviour would make them and how the student should be punished. They were also asked whether they saw the student as a troublemaker and if they could imagine themselves suspending that pupil in the future. The researchers randomly assigned names to the student records, in some cases suggesting the student was black with names like Deshawn or Darnell and in others suggesting they were white with names like Greg or Jake. The researchers found that racial stereotypes had little impact on the teachers' views of the pupils after one infraction. However, the second piece of misbehaviour was seen as 'more troubling' when committed by a black student rather than a white one. The researchers examined the views of both primary and secondary school teachers to see if their opinions of fictional pupils were altered by racial stereotypes and found they tended to judge black students more harshly . In the US black students are disproportionately punished for misbehaviour compared to white students . The teachers also tended to want to discipline black students more harshly as they were more likely to see the misbehaviour as part of a pattern. The race of the teachers who took part in the study was not immediately clear, but Mail Online has contacted the researchers for more information. Jason Okonofua, who also took part in the study, said the findings had implications beyond the school system. He said: 'Most social relationships entail repeated encounters. 'Interactions between police officers and civilians, between employers and employees, between prison guards and prisoners all may be subject to the sort of stereotype escalation effect we have identified in our research.' The researchers suggest that psychological interventions could be used to help change the stereotypes of black students influencing the way teachers treat pupils. In 2005 Trevor Phillips, then the chairman of the Commission For Racial Equality in the UK, suggested that black boys should be taught in separate classes in order to improve their educational achievements as a group. His controversial idea was met with opposition from some who said ghetto culture was to blame for the poor classroom performance of black boys, not just racism.","Study found US teachers judge black pupils more harshly after they have misbehaved than white students who have committed similar infractions .

"A group of eight-year-old children in New Jersey have written letters to convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, wishing that he will 'get better soon' while recovering in hospital from a mystery illness after being encouraged by their teacher. The cards have caused outrage and alarm among political commentators, many of whom claim the 60-year-old's illness is a fraud and clamor for attention. Abu-Jamal, who shot Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in cold blood in 1981, was taken to hospital on April 2 after collapsing in the bathroom of the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy. But this week he was delivered two batches of letters - one from a third grade class in Orange, New Jersey and another from high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union. 'Get well soon': Third graders in Orange, New Jersey, and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union have sent Mumia Abu-Jamal letters wishing him well after he was hospitalized last week . Delivery: Johanna Fernandez (right), a professor of history at Baruch College, delivered Mumia Abu-Jamal a batch of letters from two different schools in hospital. He is pictured here also with (from left) Abdu Jon and Pam Africa . Ill: Mumia's supporters say photos of the prison journalist released this week by his wife show how ill and frail he is. Untreated diabetes is said to be the reason for Abu-Jama's hospitalization last week . The letters were delivered by Johanna Fernandez, a professor of history at Baruch College, according to Education Action Group News. 'We shared a touching moment with Mumia in an effort to raise his spirits,' Fernandez reported. 'Two teachers delivered letters to us that their students had written to Mumia.' 'It had been a long time since we had seen Mumia smile. 'He chuckled as he read excerpts from these touching letters.' The letters themselves or what they said were not released. However the fact they were written and then sent has infuriated many. Richard Costello, political coordinator for the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, said the letters set a dangerous example. 'I think its both alarming and outrageous that any teacher would use a group of innocent seven-year-olds to promote a twisted agenda glorifying murder, glorifying hatred and glorifying violence,' Costello told Fox News. 'He shot (the officer) in the back and then as the officer lay slumped against a wall helpless he leaned over and shot him between the eyes. 'When he was in the hospital he actually bragged about it.' Controversial: Marylin Zunig, a teacher at Forest Street School in Orange, New Jersey, had her third graders wrote letters to Mumia Abu-Jamal. The letters have subsequently sparked outrage . Costello said all the teachers involved in the letter writing campaign should be fired. 'Furthermore all the parents who have children in that school system need to reevaluate that involvement, because these children are now placed in danger by the very people charged with their education,' Costello said. 'They are being used as tools in someone's twisted agenda.' Costello has previously described Abu-Jamal as 'the devil'. The official reason the convicted killer was hospitalized has not been released. However reports say he was suffering high blood sugar levels. Attorney Bret Grote with the Pittsburgh-based Abolitionist Law Center said last week that his client was placed in the critical care unit of Schuylkill Medical Center in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Grote says neither he nor Abu-Jamal's brother, Keith Cook, had been allowed in to see him. 'We're concerned, about as concerned as it gets, about Mumia's health,' Grote told the Philadelphia Inquirer. Hospitalized: Convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal was placed in the critical care unit of a Pennsylvania hospital last week after collapsing in prison . A Pennsylvania Department of Corrections official also declined to provide details. A spokesman for Pottsville's Schuylkill Medical Center says he had no information about Abu-Jamal. 'We never discuss an inmate's medical condition,' deputy press secretary Susan Bensinger told the Inquirer. Mumia's hospitalization was revealed Monday when a group of his friends arrived to the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy for a visit and were informed by prison staff that he wasn't there. While Grote and others had permission with the prison to visit Mumia, the hospital had not yet cleared them. Grote said he hoped the matter would be cleared up by Tuesday. Abu-Jamal is a former Black Panther serving life in prison for the 1981 murder of white Philadelphia police Officer Daniel Faulkner. Treated: Lawyers with Pittsburgh-based Abolitionist Law Center say prison officials told them their client was being treated at Pottsville's Schuylkill Medical Center . His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he's the victim of a racist justice system. Mumia's death sentence was overturned in 2012. Abu-Jamal supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary. Abu-Jamal has written several books, hosted his own radio show and even has a street named after him in France.

About a month ago, when her grandfather was over for dinner, Joy asked if he would be her date and he agreed. 'She said ""I would love that! You’re the one I wanted! Hey, will you come to the prom with me and be my beau?"" And I said I sure will!' Drain told WHNT about the sweet promposal. Like most prom nights, the festivities kicked off at Joy's house where she pinned a boutonniere on her Poppa and he wrapped a corsage around her wrist. They then took pictures in front of the house in their evening wear, marking another first for Drain who has never worn a tuxedo. Getting ready: On Saturday night, Drain came over to his granddaughter's house and the two swapped a boutonniere and corsage for the event . Prom pictures: Then, like typical prom dates, the two posted for pictures outside Joy's house in their evening wear . Family photo: After having a pre-prom dinner, Joy and her grandfather went on a horse and carriage ride around town . Drain then escorted his granddaughter to Mater's restaurant for prom dinner, where he had a special surprise waiting for the granddaughter he calls 'Princess'. After finishing their meal, the two took a horse and carriage ride around the town before dropping them off at the school for the dance. 'We were the first ones on the dance floor because my poppa loves to dance,' Joy said. Joy says her grandfather and grandmother used to go dancing all the time, but that they had to stop a few years ago when her grandmother got sick. Her grandmother died two years ago on Thanksgiving, and Joy says her grandfather now commutes to a senior center in a nearby town ever Friday night to dance. 'He inspires us to keep living no matter what happens,' Joy said. Drain was apparently the life of the party at the prom, with Joy's friends coming over to say high to and dance with the man they so often see at show choir and band concerts. Life of the party: Joy says her friends were excited when they learned that she would be bringing her 'Poppa' to prom. Pictured Joy pictured above with friends in pictures posted to Facebook (center in left image, right in right image) 'All my friends know him and everybody just loves him. When they found out that I was bringing him they were all like ""Yes, I love your Poppa!"" 'It was a great night. Once everyone else kind of left, we were literally the only people left and they started playing Elvis and 'The Twist' and we kept on dancing until they finally turned the lights on. 'It was just a fabulous night.' Joy says her grandfather had a great time and even asked if they could go again together next year. 'And I was like ""Of course we are!""'","Albertville, Alabama high school junior Joy Webb, 17, took her grandfather James Drain, 80, as her date to prom last Saturday .

"There's no in-flight service but these pooches don't mind - just the fact they're still alive is a miracle. Each year thousands of homeless pooches facing euthanasia - some hours away from death - get loaded on planes and flown to new homes in places where shelters are experiencing shortages. Groups such as California-based Wings of Rescue or South Carolina-based Pilots N Paws recruit pilots to volunteer their planes, fuel and time. The two non-profits say their concept has been a roaring success with the numbers increasing year-on-year. It's estimated that more than 4 million U.S. pets are euthanized every year. Scroll down for video . Pilot pooch, do you read me? Each year thousands of homeless dogs facing euthanasia - some hours from death - get loaded on planes and flown to new homes in places where shelters are experiencing shortages . Both pilot groups encourage spaying and neutering as a solution but know that airlifts will increase every year as they become more visible and the number of needy dogs grows. States such as California, Georgia and South Carolina typically have too many dogs in shelters, while places such as Washington, Oregon, New York, New Jersey and Florida need more pets to satisfy demand. To solve the location conundrum, pilots fire up their engines. In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, retirees want smaller dogs, which are easier to take care of but a tough find in the area with the high demand. So, the Kootenai Humane Society orders a planeload of dogs under 16 pounds every month, or more than 1,000 animals in the last 16 months, executive director Debbie Jeffrey said. Window seat: Groups such as California-based Wings of Rescue or South Carolina-based Pilots N Paws, recruit pilots to volunteer their planes, fuel and time . In safe hands: In this December 2014 photo provided courtesy of ShelterMe, pilot Jim Nista delivers Finn, a rescued dog, in Everett, Washington . Saved from peril: It's estimated that more than 4 million U.S. pets are euthanized every year . 'It's just been a real success. As fast as they come in, they are adopted,' she said. The successes increase as more pilots sign up to help. 'We have seen the number of animals rescued go up every year since we started in 2008,' said Kate Quinn, executive director of Pilots N Paws. The group's 5,000-plus pilots have flown more than 15,000 dogs to new homes each of the past two years, relocating more than 75,000 animals over the last seven years, she said. And the numbers keep rising. Growing trend: Wings of Rescue and Pilots N Paws encourage spaying and neutering as a solution but know that airlifts will increase every year as they become more visible and the number of needy dogs grows . Snuggled up: It's reported that most pooches sleep in the air and don't get sick . 'Pilots love a reason to fly. They love making these flights,' Quinn said, adding that all dogs have to be spayed or neutered, microchipped and vaccinated before they take off. Yehuda Netanel, founder and president of Wings of Rescue, says business has doubled each of the past four-and-a-half years. He started as the lone pilot who rescued 300 dogs, and now the group expects to fly 7,000 pets in 2015, he said. The pilot of 27 years will charter planes to move dogs if there aren't enough private planes, meaning flights cost about $80 per dog. Netanel and his 28 pilots are preparing to take flight this weekend with 250 dogs from San Bernardino, 150 from Bakersfield and smaller numbers from other locations. Packing them in: Kootenai Humane Society orders a planeload of dogs under 16 pounds every month, or more than 1,000 animals in the last 16 months . Puppy-dog eyes: 'We have seen the number of animals rescued go up every year since we started in 2008,' said Kate Quinn, executive director of Pilots N Paws . Pilots Kale and Anj Garcia of Seattle will be in San Bernardino to bring as many as 50 dogs back to Washington state in their seven-passenger Cessna 414. The couple have flown 16 missions for Wings of Rescue. Most dogs sleep during the flight, and only a few have had air sickness, said Anj Garcia, who will take each one out of its crate and cuddle it during the journey. The flights allowed Cathy Parker of Coeur d'Alene to find her dogs: Bella, a poodle-Chihuahua mix, and Sidney, a poodle-Pomeranian mix, who Wings of Rescue delivered from different shelters about nine months apart. 'They've been a real good match for each other and me,' she said.

"A French bus driver has proposed putting on a separate service for Roma passengers - because the 'unbearable' smell is a health risk to everyone on board. Dominique Granier sparked outrage after he suggested putting on a service specifically for people travelling from a Roma encampment next to a cemetery into the centre of Montpellier, in the south of France. But while his comments were immediately met with horror by some, the bus company TAM has taken his comments seriously and is said to have 'outsourced' part of the route. Odour: The smell on route 9 in Montpellier is said to be 'unbearable' and caused by Roma using the service . Bus driver Mr Granier said the smell which accompanied the Roma was a 'sanitation risk' in an interview last week. Speaking to the Gazette de Montpelier Mr Granier said: 'It is a true infection.' His claims were backed up by other drivers, one of whom claimed the buses were now specially cleaned because of the odour. Bernard Gotis, a local union representative, was disgusted by the comments. 'We should not tackle the poor, but poverty... We do not want to recreate apartheid in Montpellier,' he said. Apartheid: Some have said the problem is poverty of those living in the camp. Pictured: Roma in Montpellier . However, Mr Gotis revealed the bus company had taken on the suggestion, and apparently outsourced part of the route so drivers no longer had to contend with the smell. He told French newspaper Libération: 'Our management decided to follow the union by removing a piece of this bus line which is very popular with Roma and to outsource this portion of line.' The MailOnline has contacted Montpellier's bus service for a comment.","Montpellier bus driver sparks outrage with comment over the 'odour'

Loren Mathieson filmed her pet Boston Terrier, Gizmo, performing the gravity-defying stunt one day at home after he tried on a set of new booties. Footage shows him taking a few steps forwards before planting down his front feet and launching his back legs vertically in the air. He then proceeds to walk forwards, performing some graceful sidesteps as he goes. Mathieson can be heard laughing while she watches Gizmo in action. When he reaches her on the floor, he eventually steps back down to four paws. Mathieson said Gizmo performed the trick because he was unsure how to walk in his new black boots. To date the video of his circus-like trick has been watched more than 80,000 times. Like Mathieson, many viewers were left with smiles planted on their faces.

"This is the shocking moment a young Kurdish girl fires a machine gun at ISIS, before boasting she has killed 400 of the Islamic militants - as she is egged on with cries of 'kill, kill'. The little girl, who appears to be around six or seven, is shown sitting on a ridge in her bright pink jumper and trainers, just behind the large machine gun. She chats away to a man behind the camera, telling him she is 'shooting at Daesh' in Kurdish - before firing several rounds into the desert. Shocking: The little girl claims she is firing the machine gun at 'Daesh', the Arabic name for ISIS . Kill: She tells the man she has killed 400 of the extremists so far, as he encourages her to kill more . Target: However, it is unclear exactly what the girl is shooting at in the minute-long video . The man asks her how many ISIS fighters she has killed so far, and she holds up four fingers while boasting '400'. As she fires the gun, and, according to Vocativ.com, he says: 'Kill, kill.' However, whether she has actually hit anything is unclear. The video - entitled Young YPG Girl Shoots PK Machine Gun - was posted in January, but has only recently emerged on social networks. YPG is the acronym for the People's Protection Unit, which has been battling ISIS since the extremists rise to power last year. But while ISIS are known for using young recruits to carry out executions, fight and even become suicide bombers, the Kurds have so far kept their children out of the battle. Propaganda: ISIS are known to use children in videos like this one, where they are being trained as fighters . Sickening: In more horrific videos, ISIS have claimed to be using children as executioners . Feared: The Kurdish are famous for their female fighters, who have been key to driving ISIS out . Rumours: ISIS fighters believe if they are killed by a woman they won't get their virgins in the afterlife . One of the most horrifying videos released by the Islamists showed a young boy seeming to execute a so-called spy. They have also released a video of dozens of 'child soldiers' from Kazakhstan, apparently being trained to fight against ISIS enemies. Instead, they are famous for their female recruits: it has proved to be one of their strengths against the militants, as they appear to believe if they are killed by a woman they will not be rewarded with 72 virgins in the afterlife. As a result ISIS fighters have been reluctant to enter battles with the Women's Protection Units, or YPJ, reportedly leading to descent within the ranks of the terrorists and hastening their retreat from battles in places like Kobane.","Video of little girl firing several rounds 'towards ISIS' has gone viral .

"A biological father and daughter in an incestuous relationship have lost custody of their second baby after the first son, plagued with genetic problems, was also taken away. The baby boy was removed from their care four days after he was born in Oregon last year, . Eric Lee Gates and his adult daughter, Chalena Mae Moody, had asked the appeals court to overturn a decision for the baby to be put in foster care, but their case was rejected, reports the Register Guard. The baby boy was taken away just four days after he was born in Oregon and Eric Lee Gates (right) and his adult daughter, Chalena Mae Moody, (left) had asked the appeals court to overturn a decision for the baby to be put in foster care . In March, Moody, 25, was sentenced to 10 days in jail on the incest charge, but got credit for time already served and did not have to serve any additional days behind bars . Authorities say Moody and her father were living as a couple in Springfield, before moving to Klamath Falls and have had two children under two years of age. In March, Moody, 25, was sentenced to 10 days in jail on the incest charge, but got credit for time already served and did not have to serve any additional days behind bars. She also received 18 months probation. Gates, 49, is currently serving a six-month jail sentence for violating his probation by moving back in with Moody after he was originally convicted of incest in January. Gates was also ordered to pay restitution to the State of Oregon for the medical expenses of the two children. Gates and Moody are prohibited from contacting each other while on probation. Incest, even when both participants are adults, is a felony crime in Oregon. The pair have two children together - born in 2013 and 2014 -  a third died in utero. Moody was married to another man at the time of the second child's birth. The pair have two children together - born in 2013 and 2014 - a third died in utero. Moody (pictured) was married to another man at the time of the second child's birth with her father . Genetic sexual attraction is a seldom-talked about phenomenon that frequently occurs between children and their long-lost parents. It describes feelings of intense intimacy between two relatives who have been separated during the critical years of development and bonding, and then meet for the first time as adults. Essentially strangers, when an adult-child and their biological parent finally meet, the brain struggles to associate each other as family. Instead, they become captivated with one another, sharing similar physical features, likes and dislikes, which is coupled with complex feelings of intimacy. This can lead both parties to express their emotions sexually. The phenomenon was first identified by Barbara Gonyo in the Eighties, after she a wrote book called I'm His Mother, But He's Not My Son, which recounted her personal story of reuniting with the son she placed for adoption at 16. A sexual relationship with her son ensued, and Ms Gonyo says she fell in love - a byproduct of delayed bonding that normally takes place in infancy between new parents and their child, according to psychologists. Researchers believe that when family members grow up in close proximity, a inherent taboo is created through reverse sexual imprinting, which desensitises them to later sexual attraction. Called the Westermarck effect, researchers hypothesize it evolved so biological relatives would not inbreed. But according to DHS, both she and her father admitted that the two boys were their offspring. The appeals court opinion states the child born in 2013 has 'significant medical issues, including medical issues that are likely due to the close genetic relationship of his biological parents' and there is a chance these are present in the newborn. According to the appeals court’s opinion, Moody previously gave birth to three other children, all of whom have been adopted. The pair had argued that the appeals court failed to establish that their relationship posed a risk to their child who is now four months. But the appeals court opinion states the reasons that the child was taken include the mother's substance abuse and 'chaotic lifestyle' the pair both led as well as Gates' criminal past. Authorities say Gates was not Moody's custodial parent during her childhood, as he served several stints in prison while she was growing up. According to authorities, neither Gates nor Moody knew they were related when a mutual friend introduced them and the pair began a relationship. Springfield police Detective Dave Lewis said Gates and Moody openly admitted to their consensual relationship, to being father-daughter and also conceiving children together. DNA tests were performed on the family, and it was determined that Gates and Moody were related and had children from an incestuous relationship, Lewis said. Oregon State law defines incest as when a person marries or engages in sexual intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse with another whom the person knows to be related to them, either legitimately or illegitimately, as an ancestor, descendant, brother or sister of either whole or half-blood. Incest is a Class C felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and $125,000 in fines.","The baby boy was taken away four days after he was born in Oregon to Chalena Mae Moody, 25, and her father, Eric Lee Gates, 49 .

"The pups came from as far away as New Jersey and Tennessee in hopes of landing a new nickname: 'Beautiful Bulldog.' They were all defeated by a native who likes eating snow and watching turtles.

He will appear before more than 16,000 fans -- or, royal subjects -- at the university's Drake Relays to be honored as mascot of the event, which will be held from Thursday through Saturday, according to the contest's website. The tongue-in-cheek beauty pageant, which featured 50 dogs, is the kickoff event for the Drake Relays track meet. 'He's funny,' said Tank's owner, Duane Smith. 'He's a real good one.' Pageant organizers narrowed a pool of more than 100 hopeful pups by a lottery held last month. Owner: Here, Tank enjoys a rub from his owner, Duane Smith, after winning the 36th annual contest .

Should Tank be unable to fulfill his duties as the Drake Relays mascot, fellow Des Moines pup Steve will step in. Steve was second even though he was initially so shy about the makeshift catwalk set up on Drake's basketball court that his owner had to pick him up and plunk him down, much to the delight of the few thousand spectators on hand.

"She might be celebrating her 75th birthday today, but an overjoyed Queen Margrethe of Denmark looked far younger as she waved to excited crowds from the balcony at the Amalienborg Palace. The Danish monarch was joined for the balcony appearance by her son and heir, Crown Prince Frederik, 46, his wife Crown Princess Mary, 43, and their four children. Waiting below was an enormous flag-waving crowd who went into raptures as the royals appeared, watched by members of other European royal dynasties, among them Sweden's and Norway's.

The French-born royal also missed the carriage procession down Copenhagen shopping street Strøget to the Rådhus and was replaced for the day by his son Frederik. Despite being without Prince Henrik, the appearance proved a cheerful affair - largely thanks to the antics of four-year-old Prince Vincent, who did his best to scale the railings of the balcony.

"The BBC filled more than half its election TV debate audience with left-leaning voters, some of whom were brought in from Scotland and Wales, it emerged last night. The audience at the filming of Thursday night’s debate in Westminster repeatedly cheered calls for more public spending and strong defences of immigration. When Ukip leader Nigel Farage interjected and said they were prejudiced, ‘even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC’, the audience only booed him further. Scroll down for video . Bias: When Ukip leader Nigel Farage (right) said the audience was prejudiced, they only booed him further . David Dimbleby, who hosted Thursday night’s debate between the Labour, Ukip, Green, SNP and Plaid Cymru leaders, pointed out that the audience had not been selected by the BBC, but by a ‘reputable polling organisation’, later to be revealed to be ICM. The BBC initially refused to disclose the political make-up of the audience but eventually released figures late yesterday. Of the 200-strong audience, about 58 were Conservative or Ukip supporters while about 102 backed left-leaning parties – Labour, the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru or the SNP. The rest – 40 – described themselves as undecided. The figures mean just 36 per cent of the audience members with a declared political allegiance were supporters of the Tories or Ukip. But the latest ICM poll for the Guardian put the Tories on 39 per cent and Ukip on 7 per cent – a total of 46 per cent overall. Last night Mr Farage said: ‘If the audience make-up didn’t reflect that then it’s wrong.’ Out in the cold: Ukip leader Nigel Farage cuts a isolated figure at the end of the BBC TV debate on Thursday . The BBC told ICM to make sure a fifth were so-called floating voters, and for every five Labour supporters in the room, it made sure there were five for the Conservatives, four for the Lib Dems, two for the Scottish National Party, two for the Green Party and one for Plaid Cymru. The figures suggest supporters of the Tories and Ukip were significantly under-represented. ICM admitted that it recruited almost all of its audience members London. The company said in a statement that it identified ‘30 small geographical areas’ within a 20-mile radius of the Westminster debate hall and found at least eight people from each one. It also selected a ‘small number’ of SNP and Plaid Cymru from Scotland and Wales using an undisclosed method ‘reasonably decided upon by ICM’. The company refused to answer any other questions about the matter. Yesterday the BBC refused to disclose how many people had complained about its broadcast. ‘Our data shows the number of audience contacts were heavily influenced by the issue being raised during the debate and therefore we won’t be giving out figures,’ a BBC spokesman said. Conservative MP Andrew Percy said: ‘The audience should reflect the opinion polls and the fact is that nearly half of the country say they would vote Conservative of Ukip,’ ‘You have to ask yourself what would have happened if the audience had been right of centre. The left would have had a field day. They would have been so holier-than-thou.’ John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley, said the BBC’s behaviour was ‘ludicrous’ and its refusal to publish the number of complaints ‘added insult to injury’. The contest saw Labour's Ed Miliband, SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, Ukip's Nigel Farage, Green's Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood go head-to-head .","They cheered calls for more public spending and defences of immigration .

"Michael Shepard, 35, allegedly molested at least seven children within 18 months of his release . A serial pedophile in Florida has been arrested for molesting at least seven young children in his apartment complex just 18 months after he was released from prison by officials who voted to give him a second chance. Michael Shepard, 35, conned parents into letting him babysit their kids and was frequently seen riding around the neighborhood with children on his scooter, authorities say. When asked about the sex offender notification he gave to his neighbors, he claimed that he had been in prison for a 'Romeo and Juliet romance' with a preacher's daughter. Police now say he did everything he could to win the confidence of the parents at Cedar Hollow apartments in Pinellas Park so that he could prey on their children. He is accused of horrific sexual attacks on seven children, both boys and girls. His youngest alleged victim is five years old. All of them were age 12 or younger. Detectives say he tempted them with video games, candy and trips to McDonald's. He also drove young children to his 'hideout' in the woods where he allegedly forced them to perform sexual acts on him and raped them. Parents even let their children sleep over at his apartment. The Tampa Bay Times reports that Shepard, who has a history of molesting children dating back 20 years, served 15 years in prison for molesting two boys, age six and nine, at a roller rink in 1998. As his term in prison neared its end, authorities filed petitions to keep him locked up under the Jimmy Ryce Act, a Florida law that allows sex offenders to be kept behind bars past their sentences if they're likely to re-offend. Shepard posted these sex offender notifications around his apartment complex, but told parents he was convicted of sleeping with a preacher's teenage daughter . Parents soon began to trust Shepard and even let him babysit their kids, authorities say . Two psychologists examined Shepard and found that he wasn't likely molest children again after his release, the Times reports. Dr Karen C. Parker testified on behalf of Shepard at a hearing. Dr Martin Falb, the state's expert, diagnosed him with pedophilia, depressive disorder and adult antisocial behavior. He said Shepard was likely to re-offend. But at a hearing, he said he was 'straddling the fence' on whether Shepard should be kept locked up or be released, according to the Times. According to the newspaper, Shepard had been caught having sex with other inmates in prison and had a confrontation with his live-in lover, his step-brother, after his release. When he  moved into Cedar Hollow, he was required to post flyers to his neighbors informing him that he was a convicted sex offender. He still managed to win the trust of parents in the neighborhood. Within a month, a young boy was allowed to spend the night with him. The child says that when he woke up the next morning, Shepard raped him.","Michael Shepard, 35, conned parents into believing he wasn't dangerous and even convinced them to let him babysit, police say .

"Fresh testimonies from a small island community in the Maldives has reignited reports that missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 could have crashed  over 5000 kilometres away from the official search led by Australian authorities. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo, located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll in the Maldives, reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year, when the flight disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. The reports come as acoustic scientists from Curtin University refuse to rule out the possibility that 'distinctive' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the Indian Ocean. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo in the Maldives reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year when MH370 disappeared . Kudahuvadhoo is located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll, in the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean . Despite an exhaustive search that is underway along a 600 square kilometre arc approximately 1800 kilometres southwest of Perth, locals from the island believe they identified red and blue markings, similar to those of the missing plane, on a large passenger jet which flew over the island on the morning of the MH370's disappearance, reported The Weekend Australian. Villagers from the community of 3500 claim that many on the island saw the passenger plane, and were interviewed by police and testified with signed statements to what they witnessed. 'I'm very sure of what I saw on a very clear and bright day, and what I saw was not normal- the plane was very big, and low. I did not know until later that other people saw it too. I don't know if it's the Malaysia plane', said Ahmed Shiyaam, 34, an IT manager. Abdu Rasheed Ibrahim said he saw the plane flying towards him over the water, and did not know at the time that it could be the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. 'I didn't know that a plane was missing. I went straight home and told my wife about it. I told my family, ""I saw this strange plane"". This is the biggest plane I have ever seen from this island...I have seen pictures of the missing plane- I believe I saw the plane...I strongly felt those people who were searching should come here,' Mr Ibrahim said. The Maldvies National Defence Force released a statement in March last year which denied that there had been any aircrafts in the area at the time of the disappearance, which locals have branded as an attempt to hide the limitations of their radar facilities. A local media outlet reported that witnesses claimed the plane was travelling north to southeast, and that the plane was travelling so low it's doors could be seen. 'I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly,' an eyewitness told the website. Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board . The search for the missing plane has been headed up by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre . The search has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia . 'It's not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing. Some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too.' The plane dropped off the civilian radar after its transponder and other equipment were switched off shortly after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur. It was then tracked by Malaysia’s military radar heading towards the Indian Ocean. Over the past year, the search for the missing plane by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre, headed by Australia, has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia. The location of the search was primarily calculated by sophisticated satellite technology which recorded 'pings' or 'electronic handshakes' sent between MH370 and a satellite for the final hours of it's journey. The flight made a number of unexplained deviations, and flew for several hours in radio silence after it lost contact with Air Traffic Control while flying between Malaysia and Vietnam. As of early March 40 per cent of the area had been scrutinised, but there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far. 'Based on all available data as well as circumstances ... survivability in the defined area is highly unlikely. It is therefore with the heaviest heart and deepest sorrow that we officially declare Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 an accident,' said Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman. Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman declared the crash an accident . Dr Alec Duncan (left) from Curtin University's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal . The signal was recorded west of Rottnest Island using acoustic recorders (above) at 1:30 am on March 8 . The reports from Kudahuvadhoo follow information released from Curtin University  that a 'clear acoustic signal' was recorded at a time reasonably consistent with the timeline of the plane's disappearance. Dr Alec Duncan and his associates from the university's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of Rottnest Island just after 1:30 am UTC on March 8. The Centre, along with United Nations’ Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) and Geoscience Australia were involved in investigating data that might prove helpful to the search, and originally determined that the noise's source was close to the Maldives and Kudahuvadhoo. 'Data from one of the IMOS (Integrated Marine Observing System) recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of MH370,' Dr Duncan said in a statement released by Curtin University. An Indian sand artist created a message of prayer for the missing crew and passengers of the flight . Relatives of the missing passengers of flight MH370 visit a temple in China to pray for their family members . Relatives of passengers of the flight are told the news that MH370 plunged into the sea on March 24, 2014 . 'The crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds.' Dr Duncan said that the noise may have been due to a geological event, including a small earth tremor, but the timing piqued the interest of his research team. 'It would be more correct to say that our team has identified an approximate possible location for the origin of a noise that is probably of geological origin, but cannot be ruled out as being connected with the loss of MH370,' he told The Weekend Australian. In early March, Malaysia's transport minister, Liow Tiong Lai, said that data will be re-examined and a new plan formulated if the plane is not found by the end of May. It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events over the last 12 months. 2014 . 2015 .","Locals from the Maldives island of Kudahuvadhoo claim they saw a low-flying jet on the morning MH370 disappeared .

"A mother has released images of her teenage son who suffered serious injuries after he was assaulted at an Adelaide train station on Saturday night. Kat Lee's desperate plea on Facebook has gone viral as she appealed for witnesses to come forward following her son's surgery for his broken jaw in two places and a fractured cheekbone. She told The Advertiser a group of five, including four teenagers and an adult, attacked her son over money owed for a hot dog. A mother has released images of her teenage son who suffered serious injuries after he was assaulted at an Adelaide train station on Saturday night . On Sunday, Ms Lee wrote on her Facebook page that she had spent three hours at the hospital with Jaidyn. Later on she urged for any witnesses into the incident at Alberton train station, north-western Adelaide, to come forward. 'My son has been in surgery today and had plates and screws inserted into his face to hold his jaw together after they broke it in two places,' she wrote on Sunday. 'They also smashed his glasses into his face fracturing his cheek bone. He pulled through surgery but has a long recovery ahead.' Ms Lee's Facebook post has gained more than 7,500 shares. Police told Daily Mail Australia the assault took place at about 5.30pm on Saturday night after a dispute. Kat Lee's desperate plea on Facebook has gone viral as she shared images of her son following surgery for his broken jaw in two places and fractured cheekbone . Ms Lee told The Advertiser that one of the attackers had offered to buy her son and his friends a hot dog before the assault occurred. 'They never even asked for [the hot dog] and he just told them to pay him back when they had the money,' Ms Lee said. But when her son later alighted from the train, his attackers were waiting for him at the platform. 'The guy asked for his money and Jaidyn went to give him $5, but he said he now owed him $15 for interest,' Ms Lee said. 'Jaidyn said, 'No, [$5] is all I owe you'. Ms Lee also says her son's phone was stolen and was left with a black eye. She further believes another young man was also assaulted by the same group of people in the early hours of Sunday morning. Police were unable to provide further information but are still investigating the matter, despite Jaidyn requesting no further action to be taken. No arrests have been made. Anyone with information should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.","The teenager suffered a broken jaw in 2 places and a fractured cheek bone .

"Waiting times to be seen in A&E have soared to their worst level in more than 10 years, official figures revealed this morning. In the first three months of the year, 434,775 people waited longer than four hours in hospital emergency wards - some 4,830 patients every day. Over the past year, more than 1.4 million people were forced to wait longer than the target time – compared to just 353,000 in 2009/10 – the worst on record since 2004. Over the past year, more than 1.4 million people were forced to wait longer than the target time – compared to just 353,000 in 2009/10 . The figures also show that 113,648 waited longer than four-hours on trolleys in A&E, and 983 over 12 hours. It is now 89 weeks since hospital A&Es met their waiting targets. NHS England figures show that 92 per cent of patients spent less than four hours in the week ending March 29. This was down on the previous week when 93.2 per cent were seen within the time limit. It comes after the Department of Health last week confirmed the NHS has failed to meet its target every week of the winter, meaning the average for the whole year has not been met. Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said the Government was the blame for the NHS's failure. David Cameron has overseen a record hump in waiting times to be seen in A&E, official figures revealed this morning . Labour leader Ed Miliband, arriving at an election campaign event in Bristol this morning, has promised to bin the Government's NHS reforms . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has promised to give NHS chiefs 'whatever they need' after the election. Mr Hunt claimed a Conservative government would find whatever money the health service said it needed to cope with the growing pressure on hospitals and GP surgeries. The NHS's chief executive Simon Stevens has said the health service needs an extra £8billion a year by 2020 just to keep standards as they are. Mr Hunt today vowed to find the cash – but went further by claiming that the Government would find even more cash if they health service needed it. He told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'We will back the NHS's own plan in full, so we agree with the £30 billion gap, and we agree with the NHS when they say that if they can make £22 billion of efficiency savings the NHS would need £8 billion. 'But they also said in that plan very clearly that they might need less than £8 billion if they can make more efficiency savings, or they might need more than £8 billion if they can't make those efficiency savings.' He added: 'We will give whatever they need, it might be more than £8 billion, it might be less, but the point is you can only have this discussion if you have a strong and growing economy.' 'Over the course of this parliament, on the back of a strong and growing economy, we have actually increased funding for the NHS by £5 billion in real terms every year.' He said: 'After five years of David Cameron, A&E waits are at their worst level for a decade and patients are finding it harder and harder to see a GP. 'There's only one person to blame for the A&E crisis and that's David Cameron. He has made it harder to get a GP appointment, cut council social care budgets and wasted £3billion on a reorganisation that nobody wanted and nobody voted for.' Labour leader Ed Miliband, campaigning in Bristol this morning, said one of the reasons behind the problems in A&E was that the coalition policy has led to 600 fewer GP surgeries staying open at evenings and weekends. He said: 'We've just seen figures today published for waiting times in England's A&E departments which show that the first three months of this year was the worst period since the four-hour A&E target was introduced over a decade ago. 'One of the reasons for that is it's got a lot harder to see a GP. Across England there are some 600 fewer GP surgeries open in the evenings and at weekends than there were at the last general election. One in four people can't get a GP appointment within a week. 'The NHS cannot go forward if queues to see your GP are stretching backwards and I believe that Britain can do a lot better than people waiting day after day for basic healthcare. That's what our plan will do.' But a Conservative spokesperson said NHS A&Es were struggling because more and more patients were turning up at hospital to be treated. He said: 'A&E units across the UK faced unprecedented demand this winter, but English A&Es see 3,000 more patients a day within four hours than in 2009, and perform better than Scotland, Northern Ireland and Labour-run Wales, so it is completely wrong for Labour to try to turn this into a political football. 'Thanks to a strong and growing economy we are investing £2 billion in the frontline next year to transform care in the community and take the pressure off hospitals.' Labour has been accused of ‘hypocrisy’ and using out-of-date figures after claiming the Coalition has made it harder to get a GP appointment. Ed Miliband said there were now 600 fewer GP surgeries staying open at evenings and weekends than before the next election. He said this was a direct contributor to problems in England’s A&E departments, which has seen the NHS breach the target to see 95 per cent of within four hours of arrival for the 26th week in a row. The Labour Party has put the NHS at the centre of its campaign for re-election, releasing a poster today dubbed 'The doctor can't see you now', as Labour claim almost 600 fewer GP surgeries are offering extended opening hours to patients . But the Tories pointed out that the GP figures dated from 2013/14 – and did not include improvements in GP access since David Cameron pumped more money into the NHS last year. Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, pointed out that Tony Blair’s botched GP contract of 2004 has allowed GPs to opt out of responsibility for their patients out of hours. And Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said it was a ‘bit rich’ of Labour to complain of funding cuts when they wasted so much NHS money in power. A string of medical leaders came out to say Labour’s claims on GP surgeries were simply wrong. Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham wants to re-introduce a target to ensure everyone can see their GP within 48 hours of trying to get an appointment. But in an embarrassment for the party, the Labour-run Welsh government said it had no plans to introduce such a target in the principality. It came after the party launched a poster declaring the ‘Tories have made it harder to see a GP’. The poster reworks the Conservatives’ 1979 ‘Labour isn't working’ image by depicting a huge queue outside a waiting room with the title: ‘The doctor can't see you now.’ But Mr Hunt said the claim there are 590 fewer surgeries was ‘wrong’, saying that the figures quoted only go up to 2013/14. He said the Prime Minister's Challenge Fund – announced last year – covered 1,100 practices and helped 7.5 million patients see GPs in the evenings and at weekends.","In the first three months of the year, 434,775 waited longer than four hours .

"This is the shocking dashcam footage which shows a Halford's mechanic taking a customer's car for a joyride at almost double the speed limit when he took it in for an MOT. Shaun Ingram booked his Ford Focus ST in for a major service and MOT at Halfords Autocentre in Plymouth last month, costing £255. But when he went to collect his car, he was shocked to discover that a mechanic had taken it for a spin after his dashcam recorded footage of it being driven at 57mph in a 30 mph zone. Scroll down for video . Footage taken by a dashcam fitted by Shaun Ingram to his Ford Focus ST, which showed a mechanic taking a customer's car for a joyride at 57mph in a 30mph zone . Shaun Ingram, from Saltash in Cornwall, who discovered the footage, says it shows it was a pre-planned thing, not spur of the moment . Mr Ingram, 50, of Saltash in Cornwall, said that his camera recorded almost seven hours of footage, which included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car. He explained: 'When I saw the footage I was left open-mouthed. The mechanic was abusing my car and my trust. 'As a nationwide company I thought I had nothing to worry about. But I feel very let down. 'From now on I will always wait by the car whilst it is being serviced.' Mr Ingram, who is a married father-of three and works as a large goods vehicle assessor for Dairy Crest, said that the dashboard camera was not switched but was on standby mode on a motion sensor. He said: 'I was not trying to catch anybody out. I bought the camera- ironically - from a Halfords store in Plymouth last year. The dashcam captured seven hours worth of footage after Mr Ingram left his car at the Plymouth branch of Halfords . Footage showing the car being taken out on a test drive captured by the dashcam. It also showed included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car . 'I have it in for road safety purposes because of the way some people drive. 'I did not look at the footage on the Friday afternoon when I picked the car up. 'I saw it the next day and I almost choked on my pasty. The biggest file on there was the road test where the mechanic was doing nearly twice the speed limit. 'I then decided to look at all the footage. There was one clip of him reversing the car off the MOT bay and leaning over to tell a colleague ‘you wait til I road test this later.’ 'That shows that it was something that was pre-planned and not a spur of the moment thing when he was driving my car. Mr Ingram says the dashcam had been switched to standby mode and came on due to its motion sensor . 'There is another clip of him constantly swearing when he can’t find the key sensor. 'I have not been given his name and I don’t need to know unless I get a speeding ticket. 'There is no point getting really angry about it. But it is fair to say I was open-mouthed when I saw the footage. 'I took the laptop in on the Monday morning and the manager was very non-plussed when I showed him the footage. 'Had he apologised then I would have left it. But I have now spoken with the head office and the regional manager and still not received an apology. At least they have started to take it more seriously though. 'I look after my car - it is my biggest asset and cost me nearly £10,000 and it is disgusting that someone like him treats it like this. 'I would never have known about it if I did not have the camera. I did not know it would pick it up but it has proved to be well worth the money.' Halfords have explained that the mechanic who drove the car was a temporary employee at the branch in Plymouth, who has since been removed from this role. The company described his behaviour as “appalling” and offered to refund the cost for the MOT and service. The regional manager for Halfords Autocentres, Darren Stone, also told Mr Stone in an email that the mechanic’s behaviour was unacceptable. He said: 'He drove your car in what I can only describe as an appalling manner. 'I do not and will never condone that level of pure neglect which is why the mechanic in question has been removed from working within the Halfords Autocentre Group.' Meanwhile a spokesperson for Halfords head office said: 'We were really disappointed to find out that this had happened and that we have let the customer down. 'We are treating this isolated incident as a priority and can confirm that the mechanic no longer works at Halfords. 'Please rest assured that we take issues like this very seriously ensuring that our 300 Halfords Autocentres always adhere to all road test procedures.'","Shaun Ingram booked his Ford Focus ST for an MOT at Halfords, Plymouth .

"When keen runner Julie Creffield was training for a marathon when she was a size 18, she was often heckled with taunts of 'Oi, fatty!' as she ran. Even her doctor told her she was too big to contemplate running 26.2 miles and should give up on her goal. With stories like this, it is perhaps no surprise that a new survey has found two thirds of women believe they can't run - despite being desperate to be fitter and healthier. Scroll down for video . When she was a size 18, Julie was told she was too fat to run but she completed a marathon, left, and has done numerous races since, including one at the London 2012 Olympic park, right . Julie, 37, from Stratford in East London, didn't let her critics stop her from running. She completed a marathon in 2012 - and has done numerous other races since. Now through her website, The Fat Girl's Guide To Running, she's encouraging other women to take up the sport regardless of their size and ability. She appeared on today's This Morning with sub-three hour marathoner Nell McAndrew to launch the ITV show's Run For Your Life campaign. Julie said: 'Two million more men than women in the UK play sport because women are often too worried about what they look like and fear they will be judged by others, this has to stop. 'Run For Your Life will show that anyone can find success with running, and show that women of all shapes and sizes that running can be fun and can be a great way of improving physical and mental health. And if enough women get involved and give it a go, we can really start tackling negative perceptions in our own communities. 'I was told by a doctor I was too fat to run, and just three weeks later I proved him wrong by running the Brighton Marathon, but you don't have to be able to run far or even fast to benefit from the joys of running, its all about taking part and being inspired…even if you are still a little bit rubbish at it.' Julie, back right, appeared on today's This Morning with Nell McAndrew, back left, to encourage women to take up running. Front row from left: Francesca, Kerrie and Shirley are taking up the challenge . Marathon runner Nell McAndrew encouraged the women to believe in themselves . Nell, whose Guide To Running book was published by Bloomsbury this month, added: 'Break down that barrier of being embarrassed and you will meet like-minded people in the running community. 'There's lots of support on Twitter with groups such as UK Run Chat. 'When you start running, your confidence will soon grow. I just used to go to local park and could only manage short distances but I gradually built it up. Doing races is real confidence booster so believe in yourself as you can do it.' A This Morning poll of 1000 women found that 60 per cent think they can't run yet 88 per cent would like to be fitter than they are. Seventy per cent haven't been for a run in the last year but more than 75 per cent plan on getting fitter this year. Many women are put off running because they fear they are not fit enough and are self-conscious about being seen sweating and panting while out on a jog. Julie loves running and has never let her size hold her back. She encourages other women to do the same . Others believe their size is holding them back so they don't bother - even though by taking up the sport they could lose weight. The This Morning project, like the recently launched 'This Girl Can' Sport England campaign, aims to show women they can run - even if they are currently unfit and overweight. The show will follow three novice runners - Shirley Hargan-Kennedy, 38, from Glasgow, Francesca Kennedy, 23, from Redditch, and Kerrie Jones, 37, from Cannock, Staffs - as they train for five weeks to run 5K. The show is encouraging viewers to join them on the journey by taking up running themselves. The three women revealed they currently fall into the camp of not believing they can run but want to give it a go to improve their health and wellbeing. Phillip Schofield hands out new trainers to the three woman sat on the sofa who believe they can't run but have agreed to try a five week programme culminating in a 5k race . Francesca said: 'I've tried running up and down my close and I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.' Shirley said she wants to become like the runners she sees out training enjoying the exercise and taking in the scenic countryside when they run off-road. Overweight Kerry explained that her motivation is to partly aid weightloss, as well as to set a good example to her children. She said: 'I know I have always been fat but finding out I'm now classed as clinically obese is scary. 'I need to do this for my children, it's not about dress size anymore it's about health. Society is more accepting of big woman now but for health that's not good. 'What I hope to get from this is a new me so I'm not the fat mum at the school gates.' Julie knows how Kerry feels as she weighed 20st when she first started running in 2003. Now she is slimmer and fitter but she explains women have so much more to gain from taking up running than just weightloss. Nell looked the part as she arrived at the ITV studios in her running leggings and trainers . She said: 'I'm not a size 8 and if I can do it, so can you. Woman who take up running will come to realise it's fun and then they will want to do it more. We often hate running as it hurts but you can find ways to enjoy it. 'You have to build up gradually stop letting excuses like having bad knees or a bad back or no sports bra stopping you getting out the door. Get out and start walking then build up to running and you will see the health improvements.' Julia advised anyone who is concerned about taking up running to speak to their doctor first. To avoid injury, she also recommends wearing supportive trainers, starting slowly and stretching after running. One of the reasons many people avoid running is a fear that it's bad for their knees. But a study of 75,000 runners, which was published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise last year, found that 'running significantly reduced osteoarthritis and hip replacement risk due to, in part, running's association with lower BMI (Body Mass Index)'. Nell McAndrew finishing the 2012 London Marathon . 1. Invest in a good pair of trainers and some seam-free running socks. You are best going to a specialist shop for this as they will assess your running gait (or style) to find the appropriate pair. It's the only big investment you have to make and it's so important that your feet are comfortable. 2. Buy a good sports bra. Aside from running shoes, this is the other essential for women. 3. Team up with a friend so that you can support and motivate each other. If you have arranged to meet someone you'll be less likely to back out. Running with someone else also helps the minutes tick by as you have a good gossip. Alternatively look for a beginner's group or couch to 5km scheme in your area (runengland.org is a great place to start). 4. Make steady progress. If you haven't run before, download a couch to 5km programme or app (there are plenty available for free) as they advocate lots of walking and running to start with. Build up gradually, increasing your running duration by no more than 10 per cent every week. 5. Have a plan. We women are all so busy and I find it helps to sit down at the start of the week and think about what I have on each day so that I can plan when to fit in a run. It's amazing how it slots into your routine - I've jogged to school to pick up my son with my daughter in the pushchair and then jogged back as he scoots or cycles along with us. Make it work for you. 6. Log your progress. Psychologists have proven that keeping a record of your running achievements helps to spur you on. So write everything down in a diary and flick back through it when you need a boost. 7. Enter a race. OK, this is not as daunting as it sounds, I recommend everyone tries a parkrun (parkrun.org.uk) after about 5-6 weeks of running regularly. These free 5km events are held weekly at around 300 parks in the UK. 8. Be competitive. This doesn't mean you are aiming to win Olympic medals or set a record for your age group. But making targets for yourself can keep you going. It might be that you set a goal of running 5km after 6 weeks or finishing ahead of a certain person in training. It all helps hugely with motivation. 9. Eat well. One of the things I love about running regularly is that I can stay in shape without having to stick to a strict diet that forbids the eating of certain food groups. In my modelling days, the girls who were on no-carb, or no-fat diets always seemed so miserable. And sports scientists all agree that a moderate amount of carbs are essential for running. 10. Remember why you run. Maybe it's to lose weight, to raise money for charity or to de-stress. Whatever the reason, don't lose sight of it. That way when that little voice inside your head tries to stop you from heading out on a run to stay on the sofa with chocolate instead, you will overcome it. Running will empower you in a million ways. Run first and eat your chocolate afterwards (chocolate milk is proven to be a great recovery drink).

"Yingying Dou ran the essay writing site MyMaster . One of Australia's most prestigious universities will review its methods of plagiarism detection after it was claimed dozens of students who paid to have assignments written will not be punished because the university cannot identify them. Chinese-born Yingying Dou, 30, reportedly ran the MyMaster website which charged up to $1000 per assignment and was used by hundreds of students across 12 NSW universities. The University of Sydney was provided with evidence that its students had ordered 40 assignments from the MyMaster website  after an investigation by Fairfax Media. But internal emails show just five students have been found guilty of cheating, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. In an email to the university's deputy vice-chancellor, Head of Student Affairs Idena Rex said the uni was able to identify 'a maximum of five students' who used MyMaster. Ms Rex said the students were identified using plagiarism prevention software Turnitin, but the software is not used in all University of Sydney subjects meaning other students guilty of cheating could not be identified. A University of Sydney spokeswoman said 'substantially more than the reported five students' are currently under investigation after the university was provided with 40 unnamed assignments. Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website MyMaster website which has now been taken down . Two students from the University of Newcastle have been expelled and eight have been suspended . 'Upon completion of the investigation, the University will pursue disciplinary pathways as appropriate across its student and alumni bodies,' the spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. 'Failure to adhere to the University's high standards of academic merit, intellectual rigour and ethical behaviour could constitute misconduct, resulting in serious penalties such as failure or exclusion. She added that a review of the policy and procedures surrounding plagiarism  is currently underway. Another institution - the University of Technology, Sydney - said it had identified 15 university students guilty of using the MyMaster website after being provided with 94 examples. 'In 21 of the cases there was no evidence that any piece of work was carried out and these have been discarded,' UTS's Deputy Vice-Chancellor Shirley Alexander told Daily Mail Australia. 'The remainder, involving the use of false names (49) or where only receipts exist (nine), are still under investigation to determine if the students involved can be identified.' Students (a stock photo is shown) reportedly paid up to $1000 for their essays to be written for them . Professor Alexander said potential penalties range from a minimum of a zero mark for the subject to permanent exclusion from the university. 'The most common penalty would be suspension from the university for a semester, which is noted the student's record,' she said. This comes after another institution - the University of Newcastle -  last month said it had expelled two students, suspended eight students and found 21 others guilty of misconduct. The majority of students found guilty were given fail grades for 2014 subjects. It was claimed that MyMaster had an annual turnover of $160,000 thanks to Chinese international students desperate to pass their courses or too lazy to do the work themselves. Ms Dou reportedly had 100 employees working from a Chinatown office on George Street in Sydney before the website was shut down. Up to 70 students face expulsion from Australia's leading universities after being found guilty of cheating by paying the company to write their assignments . The four other worst-hit universities last month told the Herald they were still conducting investigations with accused students –  11 at University of Technology Sydney, 19 at University of NSW, and 43 at Macquarie University. The maximum penalty for academic misconduct is expulsion at all institutions except UNSW, where it is suspension. Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website. The company's Facebook page has also been removed but a holding page shows 605 previously people 'liked' it. She reportedly also runs Yingcredible Tutoring, a page which she has endorsed from her own personal Facebook account. 'We provide commerce subjects tutoring service to university students to help them pass the course,' a description on the page reads.","Yingying Dou, 30, reportedly ran the website called MyMaster .

"One in five Chinese restaurants are believed to be serving shark fin soup exploiting a legal loophole allowing people to bring the meat to this country if it is for personal consumption, a charity claims. The loophole came to light after trading standards officers raided restaurant The Royal China Club, on Baker Street in central London, and confiscated illegally imported fins. Charity Bite-Back, which campaigns to protect sharks, reported the eatery after Jason Chan, its marketing manager, boasted that it sold the soup and another dish made with ground shark teeth. Scroll down for video . The revelations come after the Royal China Club, a restaurant in central London, was raided by inspectors after boasting of selling shark fin soup and another dish made from ground shark teeth . Charity workers say that restaurants are either disguising the soup (pictured) on their menus as 'fish fin soup', or are offering it to Mandarin speaking customers if they ask . More than 70 million sharks are killed each year for their fins, often dying slow, painful deaths after being dumped back into the sea once their most valuable parts have been cut off. Graham Buckingham, campaign director at Bite-Back, told The Times he was disappointed that The Royal China Club was not fined for their breach. He added: 'There's never any big penalty for this type of discovery and even if trading standards had chosen to prosecute, the fines are described as minimal.' Charity Bite-Back believes as many as one in five Chinese restaurants are selling the soup after exploiting a loophole which allows people to bring 20kg of fins into the country if they are for personal consumption . While conducting research for a recent report, Mr Buckingham's charity discovered a legal loophole allowing for 20kg of shark fin to be brought into this country if it is for personal consumption. Just one kilogram of shark fin can fetch up to £180 through wholesale markets. He said as many as one in five Chinese restaurants could be offering the dish, but many disguised it as 'fish fin soup' or did not put it on the menu, but offered it to Mandarin speaking patrons.","Up to one in five Chinese eateries could be selling soup using illegal meat .

"Landlord: Despite attacking right to buy, Emily Thornberry has three homes . A senior Labour politician was under fire last night for attacking right to buy – while renting out a property she bought from a housing association. Emily Thornberry has come out against David Cameron’s pledge to extend the right to buy policy from council tenants to those in housing association homes. But eight years ago she and her husband bought at auction a housing association property now worth almost £1million. Tories said Miss Thornberry, who lost her frontbench job after tweeting a sneering picture of a house covered in England flags and with a white van outside, opposed right to buy but not ‘right to buy to let’. ‘This hypocrisy goes right to the heart of Ed Miliband’s Islington-based, out-of-touch Labour Party,’ said Henry Smith, who is seeking re-election as Conservative MP for Crawley. ‘They speak out against plans that help the aspirations of hardworking people on days when it’s politically useful.’ Housing association chiefs have also been accused of hypocrisy for drawing huge salaries and living in mansions while wishing to deny tenants a foot on the property ladder. Ruth Davison, of the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, has a£1million home in fashionable Islington, north London. Miss Thornberry yesterday retweeted an article from the federation attacking right to buy. And, in a question-and-answer session last week, the Labour candidate for Islington South and Finsbury criticised the policy directly. She said: ‘I don’t have a problem per se with people being able to buy their council flat or council house, so long as it is replaced like for like. 'And that’s what the problem has been. There has been a massive sell-off but they have not been replaced.’ Council house tenants in England can already buy their home at a discount of up to £103,900. The Tories would extend this to 800,000 housing association tenants who now have limited purchase rights and to 500,000 who have no rights at all. Around 2.7million people live in these properties. The subsidies would be funded by making councils sell their more costly properties when they become vacant. Each would be replaced on a one-for-one basis. The picture that cost Miss Thornberry her job as shadow attorney general was taken during the Rochester by-election, which was won by Ukip. The case highlighted just how much high-value property Miss Thornberry owned. Costly tweet: Emily Thornberry lost her frontbench job after tweeting this picture, with the sneering caption 'Image from #Rochester' while on the campaign trail in Medway, Kent . She lives with her husband, high court judge Sir Christopher Nugee, in a four-storey Victorian townhouse on an exclusive crescent in Barnsbury, north London, worth almost £3million. Emily Thornberry was forced to resign from the shadow cabinet in November after sneering at a home with St George’s flags hung outside and a white van on the drive. She said she had ‘never seen anything like it’ after tweeting a photo of the terraced home while on the campaign trail for the Rochester and Strood by-election in Kent. The then-shadow attorney general, who lives in a £3million north London house, wrote mockingly alongside the photo: ‘Image from Rochester.’ At first she tried to defend her remarks but was told to quit within hours of the tweet. The home’s owner, cage fighter Dan Ware, 37, branded her a ‘snob’. Speaking at the time, leader Ed Miliband said: ‘Respect is a basic rule of politics and I’m afraid her tweet conveyed a sense of disrespect.’ Miss Thornberry also owns a £600,000 flat in Guildford, Surrey, which she bought for her mother in 2000. In March 2007, her husband bought the housing association property in Finsbury at auction for £572,000. The three-storey townhouse was bought from Ujima, a housing association catering largely for ethnic minority tenants, which went bust just months later. It is now let. The fact a housing association sells a property does not necessarily mean social housing stock has fallen. They could use the cash to build in a cheaper area. During part of her childhood, Miss Thornberry lived in a council house. At the age of seven, her parents divorced and she and her two younger brothers moved into social housing with their mother. Labour politicians continued to attack the right to buy extension yesterday. David Lammy, a potential London mayoral candidate, tweeted: ‘Extending right to buy is one of the most senseless and irresponsible pledges ever made by a British political party.’ Last night a YouGov poll for the Policy Exchange think-tank suggested 50 per cent back extended right to buy. Housing fat cat who hates right to buy is a Labour supporter with £1m home . Hypocrite? Ruth Davison, leading critic of David Cameron's plan to extent the right to buy scheme is a Labour party member and the owner of a £1million house in Islington, London . The leading critic of Conservative Party plans to give housing association tenants a right to buy herself lives in a £1million house. As director of policy and external affairs at the National Housing Federation, Ruth Davison has been leading the campaign to prevent millions of people getting a real chance of owning their own homes. But just as she did not advertise the fact that she is a member of her local Labour party in Islington, North London, neither has she revealed just how comfortable her own house is. In reality she has been one of the country’s biggest gainers from the private property boom. She also earned hefty salaries in public bodies for years when Labour was in power. Miss Davison, 44, and husband Chris Bailey, 47, who describes himself as an ‘urban regenerator, non-profit board member and social entrepreneur’, bought a large terrace house in Islington for £440,000 ten years ago. It has now rocketed to more than £1million in value. Yet on behalf of the fat-cat housing association bosses she speaks for, Miss Davison has been across the newspapers and broadcasters this week fighting to stop the Conservative election campaign proposal to extend ‘right to buy’ legislation from council house tenants to the 2.7million people living in housing association properties. Under the scheme, housing association tenants would receive discounts of tens of thousands of pounds on the market value of their homes. Miss Davison told the BBC in response to the Tory right-to-buy plans on Tuesday that it was wrong to effectively give money to ‘some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents’. She added: ‘We are independent organisations and charities – you can no more force a housing association to sell their assets at less than they’re worth than you can force Tesco, or even Cancer Research. So housing associations would have to be fully recompensed for any sale. There will be a cost to the taxpayer.’ Miss Davison’s first major taxpayer-funded role under Labour was at the Audit Commission, with other senior roles at Bedford and Hertfordshire Strategic Health Authority and the National Patient Safety Agency. Last night Miss Davison said: ‘The price of a family house is now beyond the reach of many – I couldn’t afford to buy my home now. ‘We need to build more homes of all types to make housing more affordable for everyone, not just give money away to the lucky few.’","Emily Thornberry has criticised Conservative 'right-to-buy' policy .

"An engineer, who was sentenced to six months jail and 75 lashes after he was found with homemade alcohol in Saudi Arabia, has spoken of his frustration with the lack of help he received from the Australian embassy. Grandfather Peter Mutty, from Roseberry in Sydney's inner-west, was caught with two cartons of beer, one box of red wine and one box of white wine in his car on August 31 last year while driving home in Riyadh. The possession of alcohol is illegal in Saudi Arabia. Sydney grandfather Peter Mutty (pictured with his wife, Debbie, and grandchildren) has had a travel ban placed on him after he served time for alcohol possession, which is illegal in Saudi Arabia . While other expats who had committed the same crime in the past were deported, Mutty was ordered to serve jail time according to the Islamic calendar and received 28 of the 75 lashes he was sentenced to have. He said it was not unusual for a reduction in penalty as the point of it was to 'humiliate' a person. The 57-year-old was sent to Thoqba prison in the Al Khobar Eastern Province on October 19 and was released on March 19. He shared the same cell with two murderers, a rapist and thieves. But since he walked free, Mutty has been unable to leave Saudi Arabia or work as he has been banned from travelling out of the country without any explanation as to why this is happening . Mutty's situation has turned so desperate that he and his wife, Debbie, have reached out to family to help them by donating money. He was jailed for six months and 75 lashes, but only received 28. Mutty says he received little assistance from the Australian embassy in Saudi Arabia . The Sydney grandfather does not deny he committed the crime, but he has grown increasingly frustrated with the Australian embassy who he claims have not been taking his case seriously. 'The Australian embassy, who made contact late in the piece with the [Saudi Arabia's] Foreign Ministry, said I would not receive lashes but I did. The whole thing is a complete stuff-up,' Mutty told Daily Mail Australia. 'We don't care what the politics are, [we want them to] take this seriously. An Australian citizen is not being treated fairly.' Mutty said the embassy should have helped him try and find out which department had placed the travel ban on him. 'We don't know who put the travel ban in place. [It could have been] the police, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the office of public prosecution,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'And we can't focus on the right person to lift this travel ban. 'That’s what we're expecting the Australian embassy in Riyadh to do for us. They have to be much more proactive.' Mutty has grown so frustrated with the situation that he has gone public to drum up awareness. 'My own embassy didn't stand up for me and finally we went to Australian media and the embassy has now decided to do something,' he said. After speaking out about his situation to the Australia media, Mutty was now receiving assistance from the embassy . When asked why he had run the risk of getting caught, Mutty answered frankly: 'Because you get complacent. I never thought I would get caught. 'The way life works here for expats is all of us live on compounds and those compounds are secure,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'If you know someone on other compounds, you go to their compound in your car. '[After a barbecue], you take some food and some nibbles and some alcohol [back home], and every time you run the risk. 'It's very unusual expats get stopped by the police here... [but] on this particular day, we got stopped.' Despite his brush with the law in Saudi Arabia, Mutty said he would be willing to return and work in the country. 'I would have no problem coming back to Saudi Arabia to work,' he said. 'I knew the laws of the country. I signed a document that I understood the laws and alcohol ban was listed, so in other words I knew what I was doing and getting myself into.' A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told Daily Mail Australia tey had been providing Mr Mutty with consular assistance. 'The Australian Embassy in Riyadh has been providing Mr Mutty with consular assistance in line with the Consular Services Charter from the time he first made contact seeking assistance on 10 September 2014. 'That assistance, which continues, has included visits to him in prison, to ensure his health and welfare were being appropriately safeguarded, and official representations on his case to senior Saudi authorities,' the spokesperson said. 'The Embassy is in contact with Mr Mutty and his legal representative about having the current travel ban lifted so that he can depart Saudi Arabia.'","Grandfather Peter Mutty was caught with alcohol on August 31 last year .

"A man  who fled to South Africa in the hope of a better life has been brutally murdered by a mob who are believed to have attacked him purely because he came from Mozambique. Shocking images capture the moment the armed gang surround Emmanuel Sithole and repeatedly stab him with knives and bludgeon him with a wrench in Alexandra township near Johannesburg. In a chilling twist the victim was left bleeding to death in a gutter because a medical centre just 300 feet away was closed for the day because the doctor who worked there was also a foreigner and feared becoming a victim of a xenophobic attack himself. Doctors tried in vain to save Mr Sithole's life. His cause of death was later established as a direct stab wound to the heart and his identity established from a mobile phone found in his pocket . Attack: Shocking images capture the moment the armed gang surround Emmanuel Sithole and repeatedly stab him with knives and bludgeon him with a wrench in Alexandra township near Johannesburg . Sick: As Emmanuel Sithole lay injured in the gutter another thug saw what was going on and joined in the attack using a knife to stab him repeatedly while the first attacked continued to beat him with the wrench . The brutal attack was captured on camera on Saturday morning by a journalist from South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper who was in the neighbourhood to interview a number of foreign-born shopkeepers who'd had their businesses looted overnight. But as children played in the streets and onlookers stopped to inspect the damage from the previous evening, the Mozambique-born passer-by was brutally attacked without warning by a man carrying a metal wrench. As Mr Sithole sat injured in the gutter another thug saw what was going on and joined in the attack using a knife to stab him repeatedly while the first attacked continued to beat him with the wrench. A third attacker - wearing a grey hoodie - then reportedly entered the fray, running over and kicking Mr Sithole in the head as he pulled out a large butcher's knife. Before he had the chance to use the knife a witness intervened and the three men fled the scene. It was too late for Mr Sithole, however, who managed to stumble along the road pleading for help for his fatal injuries before collapsing fatally injured in a rubbish-strewn gutter. Under siege: The brutal attack was captured on camera on Saturday morning by a journalist from South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper who was in the neighbourhood to interview a number of foreign-born shopkeepers who'd had their businesses looted overnight . Beaten: As children played in the streets and onlookers stopped to inspect the damage from the previous evening, the Mozambique-born passer-by was brutally attacked without warning by a man carrying a metal wrench . Savage: Another thug saw what was going on and joined in the attack using a knife to stab Emmanuel Sithole repeatedly . Witnesses, including the  journalist, took Mr Sithole in the back of a car to a nearby medical centre but found it was closed because the foreign-born duty doctor had failed to turn up for his shift because he feared being attacked by the xenophobic hordes rampaging through the township. During the subsequent journey to a hospital, Mr Sithole's condition deteriorated as he screamed and winced in agony before he eventually fell unconscious. Porters initially refused to take the man into the hospital as he appeared to be dead but, after spotting him choking he was rushed inside the building where doctors tried in vain to save his life. The cause of death was later established as a direct stab wound to the heart and his identity established from a mobile phone found in his pocket. Following the attack, fearful immigrants in South Africa revealed they had been targeted  by longtime neighbors and people who warned they would assault anyone carrying a foreign passport. The immigrants spoke at a tent camp where they are now living having fled Alexandra when the mobs began attacking shops owned by those from other African countries. Harrowing: A third attacker  then entered the fray, running over and kicking Mr Sithole in the head as he pulled out a large butcher's knife . Brave: Before the man had the chance to use the large knife, a witness intervened and the three attackers fled the scene . The violence in Alexandra township followed anti-immigrant riots in and around the coastal city of Durban that killed at least six people, recalling a bout of similar unrest in South Africa in 2008 in which about 60 people died. The message from the mobs in Alexandra was, 'We don't want to see people with passports. We only want to see people with South African IDs,' said Veronica Lechaea, who comes from the southern African country of Lesotho and has lived in South Africa since 2008. Lechaea, who works as an office cleaner in Johannesburg, left her home in Alexandra and sought refuge in a camp set up on the grounds of an Anglican church by the charity Gift of the Givers. She said she makes about $250 a month and sends half of the money home to Lesotho to support her 12-year-old son, who is living there with his grandparents. The attacks stem from a perception that immigrants are taking jobs at the expense of South Africans in a country with high unemployment. Many people from other countries have entered South Africa illegally, though the government has said a large number are working legally and contributing to economic development. Some African countries are arranging to repatriate their fearful citizens, and there have been protests and calls in Malawi, Zimbabwe and other regional nations for a boycott of South African goods. Dying: Witnesses took Mr Sithole in the back of a car to a nearby medical centre but found it was closed because the foreign-born duty doctor had failed to turn up for his shift because he feared being attacked by the xenophobic hordes rampaging through the township . Fatally wounded: In a chilling twist the victim was left bleeding to death in a gutter because the a medical centre just 300 feet away was closed for the day because the doctor who worked there was also a foreigner and feared becoming a victim of a xenophobic attack himself . During the subsequent journey to hospital, Mr Sithole's condition deteriorated as he screamed in agony before eventually falling unconscious . South Africa has one of the biggest economies in Africa and it is unclear whether any boycott would have a significant impact. Immigrants from Asia and the Middle East have also been affected by the violence in South Africa. Sandra Ngwanya, a chicken seller from Zimbabwe who also left her Alexandra home for the Gift of the Givers camp, said her neighbors told her: ''We are going to go door to door, taking your stuff and beating you. So we want you to go back to your country.'' Ngwanya, who has lived in South Africa since 2006 and married a South African, said she left her two young children with cousins and hoped to go home soon. 'They are saying it's quiet. The police are all over the place. I want to go and check on our stuff,' said Ngwanya, whose husband works in a mine outside Johannesburg and planned to return to check on his family. However, some people at the camp said the situation remained volatile.","Emmanuel Sithole was attacked by a mob who repeatedly stabbed him and beat him using a metal wrench .

"Labour leader Harold Wilson secretly lobbied the BBC to change the time of popular comedy Steptoe and Son on the night of the 1964 election because he feared working class voters would stay at home and watch the show instead of supporting his candidates. According to new archive footage held by the BBC, Mr Wilson went to the home of BBC Director General Sir Hugh Greene and told him the show could cost him 20 seats. Mr Wilson was leader of the opposition and was seeking to oust the Conservative Prime Minister Alec Douglas Home. The Labour leader thought the planned repeat of the sit-com starring Harry H Corbett and Wilfrid Brambell would hit them badly. Scroll down for video . The Labour Party was afraid that its supporters would stay at home and watch a repeat of Steptoe and Son featuring Harry H Corbett, left, and Wilfrid Brambell, right, instead of coming out to vote in 1964 . Labour leader Harold Wilson, centre, approached the BBC directly to delay the show's repeat broadcast . So he approached Sir Hugh at his home to express his concerns over the broadcast. The BBC is releasing an archive interview with Sir Hugh recorded in 1982 as well as a 1981 interview with the former Prime Minister. The joint project between the BBC and the University of Sussex, which is being published today, shows the corporation's involvement in elections since 1922. According to Sir Hugh's 1982 interview: 'He came around to have a drink. He had been very much upset because the BBC had planned the beginning of a series of repeats of a very popular light entertainment programme, Steptoe and Son, on the evening of polling day. He thought that would keep away particularly Labour supporters from the polls.' At the peak of the show's popularity, some 28 million people tuned in. Sir Hugh continued: 'Harold Wilson that evening began by accusing the BBC of plotting against him. I told him that he must really know in his heart of hearts that that was untrue, and unless he withdrew that remark there was no point in our discussing anything. We could just have a drink and that could be that. 'He did withdraw and we talked about the Steptoe and Son problem. The next day I discussed the matter further with the controller of BBC One and we thought a good idea would be to shift it from early in the evening until nine o'clock, when at that time the polls closed. 'I rang up Harold Wilson and told him about this decision and he said to me he was very grateful - it might make a difference of about 20 seats to him. 'He won, I think, by four, and I've sometimes wondered what effect my decision had on British political history.' Former BBC Director General Sir Hugh Greene, pictured, said Mr Wilson feared broadcasting Steptoe and Son on the 1964 election night could end up costing the Labour Party 20 seats - they won the election by four . Mr Wilson also gave an interview on the subject which has been published as part of the archive. He said: 'Polling then ended at nine o'clock and a lot of our people - my people, working in Liverpool, long journey out, perhaps then a high tea and so on, it was getting late, especially if they wanted to have a pint first. 'I said I didn't want a popular programme between eight to nine o'clock. It was the equivalent of bringing Morecambe and Wise back. Hugh didn't think much of this argument. He said: ""What would you prefer to put on between eight o'clock and nine o'clock?"" 'I said: ""Greek drama, preferably in the original.""'","Harold Wilson feared the popular sit-com would cost him 20 seats in 1964 .

"Fed up of your neighbor's dog barking? It seems you could be in for a windfall. A couple in Oregon have been awarded $240,000 compensation for more than a decade of disquiet. Dale and Debra Krein of Rogue River filed a suit in 2012 against their neighbors and their giant Tibetan mastiffs. Winners! Debra and Dale Krein (pictured) have been awarded $240,000 after complaining that their neighbors' Tibetan mastiffs have caused them more than a decade of disquiet by barking until 5am . Overruled: John Updegraff and Karen Szewc (above)  tried to argue they needed the dogs for their livestock . Finally, after three years of proceedings, a jury has ruled in favor of the disgruntled Oregonians, ordering for the canines to be debarked within 60 days. Debarking is a surgical operation that reduces tissue in the vocal chords. The procedure lowers the volume of a dog's bark. The Kreins claimed their lives have been plagued by the noise since the defendants, John Updegraff and Karen Szewc, started breeding dogs in 2002. According to the Mail Tribune, the canines would routinely bark until 5am and throughout the day outside the property just 300 feet from the Kreins. The jury ruled that the Tibetan mastiffs (stock image), born in 2002, should have their vocal chords removed . Irritation: The Kreins' property (right) is less than 300 meters from Updegraff and Szewc (center), who claim to keep livestock on their sprawling land. The jury ruled their dogs were unsuited to protecting livestock . This continued, they told the court, despite the fact that Updegraff and Szewc were cited by Jackson County Animal Control in 2002 and 2004 for violating public nuisance codes.

"Tina Fey's husband has spoken over the suicide of a celebrity dermatologist who killed himself in the wake of a 'bullying' TV series which apparently parodied him for laughs. Jeff Richmond, who is an executive producer and the music composer on his wife's show Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, described the death of Fredric Brandt, 65, on Sunday as 'very sad', speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Online. It came as sources close to Brandt said the doctor, who suffered from depression, told People magazine he was 'definitely hurt' by an apparent portrayal of himself on the Netflix show. The friend called the Kimmy Schmidt send up 'bullying,' but added that it did not cause his suicide. Brandt was found hanged in the garage of his Miami mansion on Sunday morning. He was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the police report. The character in question, Dr Franff, had a high-pitched laugh, a speech impediment and absurd habits like drinking from a surgical bag. His face appears to be a grotesque exaggeration of Brandt's own appearance. Scroll down for videos . Speaking out: Jeff Richmond, left in New York City today, spoke out today over the death of Dr Fredric Brandt. The plastic surgeon was reportedly upset over his portrayal in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, which Richmond's wife Tina Fey, right, created and for which Richmond has producing credits . Dr Fredric Brandt (left) has a striking resemblance to Dr Franff (right), a character on Tina Fey's Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He was reportedly devastated by the portrayal . Sources were today opening up about how Brandt was wounded by the characterization - though they said that this suicide could not be pinned on one insulting TV show. A friend speaking People said: 'It was making fun of him for the way he looked and it was mean and it was bullying. '...It wasn't the only thing troubling him, it was just one factor. It definitely hurt him. He was absolutely upset, who would want that? But that was not why he committed suicide. But it didn't help. Another source, speaking to the New York Daily News, said that Brandt had become fixated on his appearance and cried in front of patients. The source said: 'He worked 15-hour days, his office was jam-packed, and I paid him a compliment. He was so sensitive he started to cry. He said how awful the public was, and how mean people are. He was really affected by negative feedback.' When DailyMail.com asked Richmond about Brandt's death near his home in New York City's Upper West Side, he said he hadn't been aware of it. He said: 'That's very sad. I don't know anything about it. I just got home. Tina might know, I don't. She's not home.' Brandt was highly-regarded for his cosmetic work across the industry, with high-profile stars including Madonna, Stephanie Seymour and Kelly Ripa. The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami where he lived alone with his dogs. A male friend who was staying at the home out of concern for the doctor called 911 at 9.17am, according to a police statement. He had last seen Brandt on the Saturday night. The police report stated that the victim was suffering from depression and was currently taking medication for it. He had also been seeking daily treatment from a psychiatrist. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department confirmed that an autopsy will be conducted on Monday. Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques.

Marc Jacobs and Dr Brandt pictured after lunching at Pastis restaurant in The Meatpacking District of New York City in June 2009 . In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones. It was also widely known that Dr Brandt injected products including Botox, Restylane, Perlane, Juvéderm, Voluma, The Times reported, into his own face, erasing his wrinkles, leaving him with full lips and an ageless quality.

Involvement: Richmond, pictured above on the Upper West Side, has a producing credit on the episode involving the apparent Brandt parody character . Don't know: Richmond said he didn't know anything about the death, and suggested questions be directed to his wife Tina Fey . The doctor told The Times that people often asked him if he was from Sweden. Brandt grew up in Weequahic neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey where his parents ran a candy store. His father died when he was a teenager and he lost his mother before he graduated from Rutgers University in 1971. He went on to attend Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia. He completed residencies at NYU's Department of Internal Medicine and then in Dermatology at the University of Miami. He set up a practice in Coral Cables, Miami in 1982 and began part-time work in New York in 1998 but quickly expanded to become one of the most in-demand cosmetic appointments. Security was tight in the gated entrance to Dr Brandt's  Miami home on Sunday. His publicist declined to comment on the circumstances or cause of death . He would sometimes see around 30 patients a day at his midtown Manhattan offices, which is filled with expensive art works, for appointments costing thousands of dollars. Brandt was considered as the number one injector of Botox and Restylane filler in the world. The doctor was regarded by his peers as a pioneer in the field and often gave lectures on the use of products. Dr Brandt also has a range of high-end dermatological products. A 1.35 oz 'Do Not Age with Dr. Brandt' Transforming Pearl Serum costs $150. He wrote two books about his work, '10 Minutes/10 Years: Your Definitive Guide to a Beautiful and Youthful Appearance' and 'Age-less: The Definitive Guide to Botox, Collagen, Lasers, Peels, and Other Solutions for Flawless Skin'. Along with his Miami mansion, Dr Brandt had a luxury apartment on the West Side of Manhattan with sweeping views of the Hudson River and filled with the esteemed art collection. Representatives for Dr Brandt and Fey have yet to responded DailyMail.com's request for comments. A Netflix spokesman declined to comment. Dr Brandt had famed practices (pictured) in Miami and Manhattan. In a 2014 profile, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony' Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy. Franff's platinum blond hair and tight skin have a stark resemblance to that of cosmetic dermatologist Fredric Brandt .","Surgeon to the stars Fredric Brandt, 65, hanged himself in his Miami mansion on Sunday .

"A fugitive Iraqi militant leader and the former right-hand man of Saddam Hussein has reportedly been killed in a skirmish. Iraqi officials said Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri had died in fighting with government troops in Salahuddin province, north of Baghdad. Al-Douri, 72, headed the Naqshbandi Order insurgent group, an important faction behind the recent rise of ISIS. Scroll down for video . Al-Douri was an Iraqi military commander and was Vice Chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council, until the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq . Al-Douri was the King of Clubs in the famous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse . He was one of Saddam's most trusted henchmen, helping to lead his 1968 bloodless coup. Both Al-Douri and Saddam came from the same Tikriti tribal background. He was then deputy to Saddam when he was deposed following the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Following the execution of Saddam Hussein on 30 December, 2006, Al-Douri was confirmed as the new leader of the banned Ba'ath Party. Al-Douri was deemed the most high-profile official of Saddam's Ba'ath Party to evade capture after the invasion. He was ranked sixth on the US military's list of the 55 most-wanted Iraqis after offensive to overthrow Saddam and had a $10m bounty on his head. He was the King of Clubs in the infamous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse. His dead body was pictured on social media today with his teeth missing, an unkempt orange beard and a bloody head wound. Salahuddin governor Raed al-Jabouri said soldiers and allied Shia militiamen killed him in an operation east of Tikrit - a city that was recaptured by the government two weeks ago. He said: 'This is a major victory for those involved in the operation. He is considered a mastermind for this terrorist group. 'For sure this will have an impact on them...there will be a break among them.' ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq. However, in recent months Iraqi forces, supported by US-led air strikes, have captured large areas from the terrorist group. But today, a car bomb killed three people outside the U.S. consulate in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region that is allied with Washington in a war against Islamic State, which claimed the attack. No U.S. personnel were hurt in the blast, according to the State Department which said a 'vehicle-borne improvised explosive device' exploded right outside the entrance to the heavily fortified compound. Islamic State also claimed responsibility for two car . bombings in Baghdad that killed at least 27 people on . Friday. 'The fighters of the Islamic State detonated two car bombs . in the heart of the Iraqi capital this evening and a third in . Erbil,' the group said via its news agency.

Kurdish security forces respond to an explosion at the pedestrian entrance to the U.S. Consulate complex . In the invasion of Iraq by a US-led coalition, the military developed a set of playing cards to help troops identify the most-wanted members of Saddam's regime. This was mostly high-ranking members of the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party or members of the Revolutionary Command Council. The cards were officially named the 'personality identification playing cards'. Each card contained the wanted person's address and, if available, the job they carried out. The highest-ranking cards, starting with the aces and kings, were used for the people at the top of the most-wanted list.

"A laser could be mounted on the International Space Station and used to shoot down pieces of space debris in Earth orbit, says a new paper. The system would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up. Tokyo researchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS. It would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown). The system would have a range of 62 miles (100km) and could target things less than 0.4 inches (1cm) in size . The paper, by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, was published in Acta Astronautica. Their system would use the Extreme Universe Space Observatory’s (EUSO) super-wide-field telescope on Japan’s Kibo Experiment Module on the ISS. The laser, meanwhile, use bundles of optical fibres to produce powerful laser pulses - capable of both high power and high frequency, although exact figures were not given. Since the first object, Sputnik 1, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of hundreds of thousands of items of debris. The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel. There are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and valuable satellites. One major source of debris in the past was a Chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007 that left an estimated 150,000 pieces of junk in the atmosphere. Accidental events have also contributed to the problem. In 2009 for instance there was a major crash between a U.S. communications satellite and a defunct Russian military probe over Siberia. Combining these two instruments would create a system that could deorbit space debris down to the size of 0.4 inches (one centimetre). The impact of the laser beam on debris would create a force that reduced its velocity, causing it to fall into Earth’s atmosphere and burn up. The group plans to deploy a small proof-of-concept experiment on the ISS, with a small, eight-inch (20-centimetre) version of the EUSO telescope and a laser with 100 fibres. ‘If that goes well, we plan to install a full-scale version on the ISS, incorporating a three-meter [10ft] telescope and a laser with 10,000 fibres, giving it the ability to deorbit debris with a range of approximately 100 kilometers [62 miles],’ said lead researcher Dr Toshikazu Ebisuzaki. Looking further into the future, the team said they could have a ‘free-flyer’ mission not attached to ISS in another orbit to shoot down debris. For example, such a system could be deployed in polar orbit at an altitude of about 500 miles (800km), ‘where the greatest concentration of debris is found,’ according to Dr Ebisuzaki. Without going into specifics, the team says their proposal could remove ‘most’ of the centimetre-sized debris in Earth orbit within five years of operation. MailOnline has asked the researchers to explain how often the laser would fire, and what its maximum capacity in terms of debris-size to deorbit would be. The technology bears some similarities to the Death Star - shown - used to devastating effect in the original Star Wars trilogy. Without going into specifics, the team says their proposal could remove ‘most’ of the centimetre-sized debris in Earth orbit within five years of operation . The paper, by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, was published in Acta Astronautica. Their system would use the Extreme Universe Space Observatory’s (EUSO) super-wide-field telescope on Japan’s Kibo Experiment Module on the ISS (shown) The EUSO telescope was originally planned to detect ultraviolet light from air showers produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays. But the researchers realised they could put it to another use - the removal of space debris. The fibre-powered laser, meanwhile, was originally developed to power particle accelerators - but again another use for it was found. Space debris, which is continuously accumulating as a result of human space activities, consists of artificial objects orbiting the earth. The number of objects nearly doubled from 2000 to 2014 and they have become a major obstacle to space development. The total mass of space debris is calculated to be about 3,000 tons. It consists of derelict satellites, rocket bodies and parts, and small fragments produced by collisions between debris. ‘We may finally have a way to stop the headache of rapidly growing space debris that endangers space activities,’ added Dr Ebisuzaki.","Tokyo researchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS .

"It may have been invented for students to use. But youngsters appear to be deserting Facebook in droves because it is now so popular with their parents – and grandparents. Almost a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’. The trend comes as increasing numbers of older users turn to the social network to stay in touch and share family pictures. Nearly 60 per cent of Britons aged over 55 now have a Facebook account, according to research. Facebook has even started running television adverts to entice the so-called ‘silver surfers’ to join. Now a survey of around 2,000 Britons has revealed that it is having the opposite effect on youngsters. ‘As parents are signing up, their children are logging off to maintain privacy,’ said Lord Jim Knight, chairman of online lobby group the Tinder Foundation. In the poll, a third of Facebook users are said to have blocked a family member so they can no longer see their account or do not receive automatic updates. The survey did not take account of the number of youngsters who have effectively blocked their family members by refusing to add them as a ‘Facebook friend’ in the first place. One in ten people aged 16 to 34 signed up to other platforms so they could remain ‘under the radar of their parents’. But whilst youngsters may be leaving Facebook, they are not giving up on social media altogether. More than half said they had joined Twitter, where only 13 per cent of ‘silver surfers’ said they have accounts. Meanwhile, about 40 per cent of youngsters use the picture-sharing website Instagram, according to the study commissioned by Halifax and carried out by Opinium Research. Logging off: Nearly a third of people aged 16-to-34 have deleted their facebook accounts because they no longer see it as ‘cool’ Around the same proportion use Snapchat, a social media platform which automatically deletes messages shortly after they are sent. The picture was very different among the over-55s. Just three percent have an Instagram account and even fewer – around one percent – use Snapchat. The way people use these different social platforms is also changing. Around a fifth of those aged 16 to 34 use their smartphones at family dinners, posing a threat to the precious mealtimes that used to be the cornerstone on family life. By comparison, just one percent of silver surfers use their smartphones during a meal with their offspring.","Parents and grandparents flocking to social media site .

"Controversial payday lender Wonga could change its name in a desperate attempt to regain credibility after a string of scandals caused the firm to lose £37.3million. The firm has been hit by new rules on payday lending, as well as being forced to pay compensation to customers who were sent fake legal letters. Wonga's revenues fell by nearly £100million last year to a total of £217.2million, it was announced today - months after the company wrote off the debts of 300,000 customers. Controversial: Wonga, whose puppet advert is shown here, has reported a loss of £37.3million . Now chairman Andy Haste says that the company might ditch its controversial brand in a bid to repair the company's reputation. 'We are not ruling it out or in,' he told Reuters today. 'The question comes down to whether it remains the only brand or one of many brands, and ultimately does it stay as a brand for the overall company?' Wonga's financial woes are expected to continue thanks to a new cap on the interest rates it can charge which was introduced at the start of this year. Announcing the firm's latest set of results today, Mr Haste said: 'We said Wonga would be smaller and less profitable in the near term as we focus on creating a sustainable business that lends responsibly and transparently to customers who can afford to borrow from us. Desperate measures: Chairman Andy Haste says that Wonga might change its name . 'We know it will take time to repair our reputation and gain an accepted place in the financial services industry, but we're determined to deliver on our plans and serve our customers in the right way.' He said that all credit providers have to 'put their customers first and lend responsibly', admitting: 'Regrettably, that has not always been the case at Wonga.' The firm's chairman insisted that Wonga would no longer lend to customers who cannot afford to repay their loans, and said that the company had 'grown too quickly' without putting in place the necessary management structure. The number of Wonga's customers in the UK fell by nearly half, to 575,000, with the company making 2.5million loans in the course of 2014 compared to 3.7million the year before. The total amount of money lent fell from £1.1billion to £732million - but the company said that just 6.6 per cent of loans were defaulted on, down from 6.9 per cent in 2013. Wonga has cut the proportion of loan application it accepts from 80 per cent to just half after toughening up the criteria which potential lenders must meet. However, Mr Haste admitted that it is likely to take another year to turn the company around, saying that 2016 would be when 'we will start to come back'. Last year, Wonga took a £35million hit from writing off 300,000 personal loans, and also faces a £20million bill over the bogus legal letters scandal. The company was ordered to compensate 45,000 customers who were sent official-looking letters demanding repayment from law firms which were actually just a front for Wonga itself. Wonga also courted controversy with its cheerful adverts featuring puppets, which critics claimed were designed to appeal to children and which have now been pulled from the airwaves. Row: The company now faces new restrictions on the amount of interest it can charge on loans . New rules introduced this year are designed to clamp down on the costs of payday loans offered by companies like Wonga. Interest rates have been capped at 0.8 per cent a day - meaning that Wonga has had to cut its annual rate from 5,853 per cent to 1,509 per cent. Experts have warned that up to 99 per cent of payday lenders could be driven out of business by the rates cap, although Wonga is considered likely to survive because of its high profile. However, earlier this year Wonga announced that it was sacking 325 staff - a third of its workforce - in the wake of the new rules. Among those who have led the criticism of Wonga is the Archbishop of Canterbury, who announced plans to set up a Church-backed credit network which can compete with payday lenders. Clampdown: Payday lenders are now significantly restricted in the interest rates they can charge . March 2013: The UK's biggest payday lenders are threatened with being put out of business after a damning report by the Office of Fair Trading uncovers evidence of 'widespread irresponsible lending'. June 2013: The OFT refers payday lenders to the Competition Commission for a full-scale inquiry, saying it has found 'deep-rooted' problems. It finds some firms' business models appear to be based around customers taking out loans which they are forced to roll over because they cannot afford them. March 2014: Payday lenders face a new inquiry to see how sympathetic they are when customers struggle to pay back their debts, the Financial Conduct Authority announces. April 2014: Supervision of the whole payday lending industry passes from the OFT to the FCA. The FCA immediately starts putting tough new rules into action, including forcing payday firms to provide financial health warnings in emails, online and in texts and signpost people to free debt help. June 2014: The Competition and Markets Authority releases provisional findings from its competition investigation and says that payday loan borrowers are paying around £60 a year over the odds because of problems shopping around. It suggests setting up an independent price comparison website for payday customers. The FCA announces that Wonga is to pay £2.6million in compensation after chasing struggling customers with fake legal letters in order to pressurise them into paying up. Between October 2008 and November 2010, the firm sent correspondence to about 45,000 customers in arrears from non-existent law firms threatening legal action. July 2014: The payday industry comes under more new rules overseen by the FCA. From July 1, payday firms have to include risk warnings in television advertising. They are also banned from rolling over a loan more than twice. The FCA proposes a cap on payday lending, meaning that from January interest and fees on new loans, including those rolled over, must not exceed 0.8 per cent for each day of the amount borrowed. October 2014: The CMA announces plans that will force payday lenders to sell their products through impartial comparison websites as part of a new clampdown by the watchdog . January 2015: The FCA's new cap on interest rates comes into force. It is predicted to squeeze up to 99 per cent of lenders out of the market. February 2015: The Competition and Markets Authority says payday lenders will have to put their deals on comparisons sites, as Wonga reveals plans to sack one third of its workforce. April 2015: Wonga reports a pre-tax loss of £37.3million in the wake of its high-profile struggles.","The firm lost £37.3million after revenues fell by a third over the past year .

"Students have fallen out of love with the Green party, after a dramatic slump in support for their leader Natalie Bennett, a new poll shows. On the day the party launches its Youth Manifesto, a survey reveals only 15 per cent of people at university now say they plan to vote to vote Green, down from 28 per cent in February. After a series of faltering media performances by Ms Bennett, the proportion of students who dislike her has doubled since September to 24 per cent. Scroll down for video . A new survey of students reveals a dramatic fall in support for the Green party, down to 15 per cent from 28 per cent in February . Since September, the proportion of students who dislike Green leader Natalie Bennett has doubled to 24 per cent, although Ukip's Nigel Farage remains the most unpopular . There was a time when the Lib Dems could bank on the support of students, but Nick Clegg reneging on his promise to scrap tuition fees saw his supporters desert him in their droves. Labour has been the main beneficiary, with 35 per cent now saying they will vote for Ed Miliband, although this has fallen from 46 per cent in September 2013, according to YouthSight. Support for the Greens rose steadily over two years, and peaked at 28 per cent in February. But since then it has dropped sharply to only 15 per cent, meaning they have now been overtaken by the Conservatives who are on 25 per cent. YouthSight interviews around 1,000 undergraduates across the UK for its surveys. Ms Bennett's profile has soared in recent months, buoyed by rising poll ratings and Green party membership in England passing 60,000 for the first time. But she has struggled in media performances, including a radio interview when she suffered a 'brain fade' while discussing housing policy and a TV grilling in which she said it should not be a criminal offence to join extremist groups like ISIS or Al Qaeda. She has also failed to make an impact in the TV leaders' debates, which have been dominated by the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Ukip's Nigel Farage. Ms Bennett's profile has soared in recent months, buoyed by rising poll ratings and Green party membership in England passing 60,000 for the first time but she has been stung by poor media performances . In September, 12 per cent of students said they disliked Ms Bennett but this month the figure has leapt to 24 per cent. Over the same period David Cameron and Nick Clegg have seen falls in their levels of dislike, while Ed Miliband remains on 28 per cent. Ben Marks, managing director of YouthSight said: 'Our recent waves of polling data have charted the Green Party's rise amongst students, steadily climbing past the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. 'However as the election approaches the Green bubble, if not quite burst, seems at least to be deflating. 'This latest wave sees the Greens fall 13 points, from 28 per cent to 15 per cent, losing second place for the first time this year. 'It appears that the Green Party are struggling to compete with the more established parties now that election campaigning has begun in earnest. This is also potentially evidence of a 'protest vote' ebbing away.' The Green party today launched their Youth Manifesto with a pledge to invest an extra £1.1billion in youth services, creating 2,000 new Young People's Centres. As the party launched its Youth Manifesto today, there were questions about Ms Bennett's leadership after it emerged her boyfriend had written bizarre blogs about rape, kidnap and murder . But deputy leader Amelia Womack faced questions about Ms Bennett's leadership after it emerged her boyfriend had written bizarre blogs about rape, kidnap and murder. Jim Jepps used a blog called The Daily Maybe to defend 'rape fantasies', describe paedophiles as 'complex human beings' and question why teachers who have relationships with pupils are put on the sex offenders register. The couple met five years ago when Ms Bennett contacted him to correct something he had written about her. However, the Green party stresses they do not 'want to be associated' with his internet rants. Speaking at the launch of the party's youth manifesto in Kentish Town, north London, Ms Womack said: 'Jim isn't anything to do with the Green Party and he isn't a member. 'But obviously ... obviously there is a lot of, kind of ... He hasn't put himself in the public profile, it is Natalie whose put herself into the public eye and so it is ... basically it must be really hard to have her public life, sorry her private life, brought into the public like this.' Asked if she thought the reports would damage the party's image or reputation, she said: 'Well, I think it's very clear that Jim isn't part of the party and that Natalie is our spokesperson and these aren't opinions that are held by Natalie and they're certainly not opinions that are held by the Green Party and opinions that are condemned by the Green Party - but it is Natalie who is our spokesperson.'","Support for Greens on campuses falls from 28% to 15% in two months .

He once described the scene on the field: 'From our broadcast box you can’t see any grass at all, it is simply a carpet of humanity.’ On captaincy, and he was one of the best Test captains Australia ever had, Benaud was modest: 'The hallmark of a great captain is the ability to win the toss, at the right time.’ His commentary was understated and often extremely funny, and his one-liners were perfectly timed . The former leg spinner turned cricket commentating into an art form, giving him the title'the Voice of Cricket' But he cautioned that description with: 'Captaincy is 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent skill. But don’t try it without that 10 per cent.’ When fellow leg spinner Shane Warne produced the so-called 'Ball of the Century' to dismiss English batsmen Mike Gatting, Benaud said: 'Gatting has absolutely no idea what has happened to it. Still doesn’t know.’ But his mastery of understatement didn't mean he couldn't offer forthright opinions on the latest cricketing controversy. On Australian bowler Trevor Chappell's infamous underarm bowling incident in February 1, 1981, Benaud said: ‘It was a disgraceful performance … and it should never be permitted to happen again.’ He also wasn't afraid of the odd double entendre when cricketers came to grief on the field or there were some antics from spectators. His trademark word, 'Marvellous...' will forever be linked to the cricket legend . Once after a player had been hit in the groin, he said: 'Take away the pain, leave the swelling'. After a streaker ran on to the field: 'There was a slight interruption there for athletics.' Although comical on the pitch, off the pitch he was a serious man with a big heart. When Test and One Day cricketer Phillip Hughes tragically passed away, Benaud narrated a heartfelt tribute for the 25-year-old. 'A boy, just beginning, 25 years of age, baggy green number 408. His father’s best mate, son, brother, fighter, friend, inspiration… Phillip Hughes, forever rest in peace, son,' he said. Back on the field, on a Justin Langer six he said: . 'He's not quite got hold of that one. If he had, it would have gone for nine.' And will any commentator ever be able to match his tributes to a fine piece of play on the field? 'Top shot that.'","Cricket commentator Richie Benaud has passed away after cancer battle .

"Despite his daughter remaining in a medically induced coma since she was found unresponsive in a bathtub at her Atlanta home in January, singer Bobby Brown told an audience on Saturday night that she is 'awake.' Bobby was performing at the Verizon Theatre in Dallas when he told the stunned audience that 'Bobbi is awake. She's watching me.' The singer didn't elaborate on if his daughter had regained consciousness or if he was talking instead about her spirit. After the 46-year-old's comment, his sister Tina posted on Facebook, '[Bobbi] woke up and is no longer on life support!!!!!:):)God is good!!thanks for your prayers,,still a process,but she is going to be ok:):):):).' But TMZ reported on Monday that Whitney Houston's family insists the 22-year-old is not awake and is the same condition she was when she entered the facility. Scroll down for video . Singer Bobby Brown was performing at the Verizon Theatre in Dallas on Saturday night when he told the stunned audience that 'Bobbi is awake. She's watching me' 'She's in the exact same condition she was in when she went into the facility.' a source told the site, adding the budding singer will only blink occasionally. She is still on a ventilator. There have been reports in recent weeks that Bobby and his desire to keep his daughter on life support is at odds with the family of his deceased ex-wife Whitney Houston. Bobbi Kristina's aunt Pat Houston and grandmother Cissy Houston both believe that the time has come to take her off life support as she has shown no signs of improvement. 'Of course Bobby wants Krissy to wake up and return to her life. That's all he wants. But there doesn't seem to be a lot of hope and the Houston family is resigned to the fact that keeping Krissy on life support may not be the best option,' a source told the Inquistr. 'They don't think what Bobby is doing is the best thing for her.' A source close to Bobbi Kristina's family reportedly said that 'nothing has improved' for her even after she was moved to the DeKalb Medical facility in Atlanta in mid-March. According to sources, the family is also concerned if Bobby Brown will remain available to make an emergency medical decision for Bobbi Kristina as he might head to Australia next month. Bobby Brown spoke for the first time about daughter Bobbi Kristina in Los Angeles a week ago on Saturday and admitted: 'I dunno what the hell ​I am going through right now, but I am giving it to God and letting him deal with ​it' Unresponsive: On January 31, Bobbi Kristina Brown was found unresponsive in her bathtub. She's been in a coma ever since . Last week, Bobby Brown made his first public appearance since the aspiring actress was hospitalized by performing at the Soul Food Festival in Los Angeles. During the 11 April performance the singer admitted 'I dunno what the hell ​I am going through right now, but I am giving it to God and letting him deal with ​it.' In an emotional outburst during a concert Bobby appeared close to tears as he referenced his daughter's ongoing battle for her life.​ . He looked tired and grief stricken at times during his performance, his first public appearance since Bobbi Kristina fell into a coma. The one-time boy band star shied away from talking in detail about his daughter but instead admitted these were 'rough times.' However, in an odd moment during his 45-minute set, he took time out to promote his range of BBQ sauces. Bobby performed a set of his old hits for 4,000 fans at the Soul Food Festival ​in downtown Los Angeles ​after months staying by his daughter Bobbi Kristina's side. The 46-year-old was given the biggest cheer of the night as he took to the stage to play hits like Don't Be Cruel and ​On Our Own. ​After his drawn-out introduction Bobby, looking tired from performing dance moves, choked up as he said: 'I must ​tell y'all. This feels really, ​really really good. 'I want to thank all of y'all for coming out tonight​ to support me and my family. Broke his silence: The former boy bander's appearance was booked before Bobbi Kristina fell into a coma. It was also Brown's first time discussing the matter in public . ​'Rough times are rough times, hard times are hard times I dunno what the hell ​I am going through right now, but I am giving it to God and letting him deal with it.' ​Panting and sounding frustrated: '​There is only one thing I ask of you all tonight and that is enjoy yourselves.' Smiling he added: 'Don't be cruel, come on,' referring to one of his biggest hits​ the 80s. ​After a few other tunes, Bobby needed a break from the stage to rest while his boyband performed a number. Bobby needed a towel to wipe his face and often looked out of breath as he relived dance moves from his glory days. Later he was a little less emotional as fans cheered his performances of hits like Roni and Rock Witcha. Had a booth: Brown told the LA crowd, 'Listen I have been doing a lot of things and been working on a lot of projects from Real Husbands Of Hollywood to my own stuff to my new album to my new Edition to Heads Of States and I have been working on my food line; actually you all can get some food right there, in my booth' Looking toward his stand where his Bobby Brown BBQ cooking tent was set up at the festival, he told the crowd: 'Listen I have been doing a lot of things and been working on a lot of projects from Real Husbands Of Hollywood to my own stuff, to my new album, to my new Edition to Heads Of States, and I have been working on my food line. Actually you all can get some food right there, in my booth. ​'​I will over there in a little bit​ later, if you want to buy some barb​e​cue sauce, seasonings, chicken and a couple of sausages. I don'​t know what my wife is cooking ​- whatever it, is is good. You have got to get the season​ing​, because the seasoning is off the chain, I must let you know.' ​Bobby then asked a bandmate to talk about another brand, but fired back: 'Mine is much better, low in sodium content​, low in salt for us folk if, you understand what I ​am saying. ​'So I made this for us.' Wiping away sweat from his face, he added: 'I ain't done with it yet. I got marinades and all kind of s*** coming out.' He then corrected himself: 'Excuse my French baby girl. I didn't mean to curse in front of you. And ladies too.' He then introduced his new ​R&B​ boy band band 'who can saanng.' 'You just listen and tell me if you like it.' Back to work: Brown's pregnant wife Alicia Etheredge was also at the food festival, selling Bobby Brown's BBQ sauce . ​Bobby's appearance marks his first time away from Bobbi in months. He had been scheduled to make the appearance before his daughter's accident. Bobbi remains hospitalized and in a coma after being found unconscious and face-down in a bathtub on January 31. The Soul Food Festival is among a string of appearances Bobby is contractually obligated to fulfill/ The singer is also scheduled to leave daughter Bobbi to tour in Australia. Even though he doesn't want to go, the promoters are holding the distraught father to his contractual obligation, TMZ reports. Bobbi Kristina remains on life support in a long-term care center in Atlanta, Georgia, after being treated at the city's Emory University Hospital where the ex-husband of Whitney Houston visits her regularly. Reportedly Bobby has the final say as to whether the young woman's support system is turned off.","The singer was performing at the Verizon Theatre in Dallas on Saturday .

"Ed Miliband is in league with the Scottish Nationalists and preparing to allow them to be ‘the chain to Labour’s wrecking ball’, David Cameron will say today. The Prime Minister – who last night said he would be a ‘big failure’ if he does not win a Commons majority – will unveil an analysis to show Labour and the SNP are ‘really on the same side’ and want ‘more borrowing, more debt and more taxes’. Mr Cameron will show that, since Mr Miliband became Labour leader, the SNP has trooped through the lobbies with his MPs in 91.5 per cent of Commons divisions. The SNP backed Labour in 27 out of 28 votes on welfare and 62 out of 65 on the economy. Warning: David Cameron will unveil analysis to show Labour and the SNP are 'really on thre same side' today . Labour and the SNP have ruled out a formal coalition but refused to do the same for a looser arrangement that would prop up a minority government led by Mr Miliband. The Prime Minister last night told BBC Newsnight presenter Evan Davis that he would feel he had ‘not succeeded’ if the Conservatives failed to win a majority. His intervention today will pile pressure on the Labour leader ahead of tonight’s TV ‘challengers’ debate’, in which he will square up to SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. Miss Sturgeon’s performance in the first TV debate has seen her party surge further, breaking 50 per cent in one poll and threatening Labour with wipeout north of the border. Since Mr Miliband became Labour leader, the SNP has trooped through the lobbies with his MPs in 91.5 per cent of Commons divisions, Cameron will say . Yesterday, she suggested she would seek to hold Labour to ransom on a vote-by-vote basis, insisting: ‘It’s perfectly possible to defeat governments on issues and to change the course of governments on issues without bringing the government down.’ Even senior Labour figures have doubts over Mr Miliband’s decision to be the only leader from the main Westminster parties to appear with Scottish and Welsh nationalists, the Greens and Ukip, putting him in danger of being outflanked on all sides. A Labour source said: ‘Our best hope is that nobody watches it and it’s just a damp squib. Other than that, we’re hoping the media narrative is that Cameron was right to sit this one out, not that Ed looked like an idiot.’ Mr Cameron, launching his party’s Scottish manifesto in Glasgow, will say Scotland is the scene of a ‘massive political fight’ that could determine the future of the UK. ‘We’ve got Labour and the SNP on opposite sides – slugging it out – but if you take a step back they’re really on the same side,’ the Prime Minister will say. ‘You have a weak Labour party, who want more spending, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes. And the people who will prop them up, the SNP – who want even more spending, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes. ‘Together, they pose a clear threat to the future of our United Kingdom: a coalition of chaos. The SNP acting as the chain to Labour’s wrecking ball, running right through our economic recovery – and it will be you who pays the price.’ The Conservative analysis shows that, in 319 votes between 2010 and 2015, Mr Miliband trooped through the voting lobbies with SNP MPs on 292 occasions. Labour and the SNP (pictured, SNP leader and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon) have ruled out a formal coalition but refused to do the same for a looser arrangement that would prop up a minority government led by Miliband . David Cameron told BBC Newsnight presenter Evan Davis he will have failed as Tory leader if he does not win a majority at the next election . Labour and the Scottish Nationalists joined forces to oppose Government policies to rein in benefits and reward work. Both parties also voted against capping benefits to stop people taking home more in welfare than the average family earns in employment. Miss Sturgeon hailed tonight’s challengers’ debate as ‘another opportunity to take the SNP’s positive message on the progressive policies we believe in to people right across the whole of the UK’.","David Cameron will unveil analysis to show Labour and SNP 'on same side'

"An explorer who plans to spend a year living inside a ball-shaped capsule on top of an iceberg is seeking funding for his daring project. Italian Alex Bellini is to be subjected to the full force of the iceberg as it melts, cracks and even flips - while hopefully staying safe inside his small spherical cabin. The aim of the cabin fever-inducing stunt is to highlight how global warming will melt icebergs around the world and cause sea levels to rise. Scroll down for video . Italian Alex Bellini will live atop an iceberg in Greenland starting next year. He will live inside a contained ball (artist's illustration shown), with no means to escape for 12 months. The capsule will be 10ft (three metres) wide and could fit 10 people - but Mr Bellini will remove all of the seats apart from one, for himself . Mr Bellini, 36, is seeking funding for his project, called Adrift, which he hopes to begin in November 2016. Previous feats by the explorer include running more than 14,000 miles (22,500km), rowing more than 21,000 miles (34,000km) and spending 560 days in isolation. He has rowed both the Atlantic and Pacific and insists he favours challenges where there is a perceived lack of control. The capsules, initially designed essentially as escape pods for areas at risk of tsunami, can hold from two to ten people and range in price from £8,000 to £13,500 ($12,000 to $20,000). Four are currently in use in Japan, while two are in the US. Mr Bellini will use one at the upper scale, 10ft (three metres) wide - although he’ll remove all the seats except one for himself. Inside he’ll have exercise equipment, such as a stationary bike, in addition to supplies for the year such as food and water. But his latest venture represents a whole new challenge as he will have to deal with intense isolation and undergo serious psychological tests as he copes with being alone for 12 months. Perched on top of an iceberg in North West Greenland, he will be alone and unable to leave the capsule, leaving him vulnerable to whatever is in store - on the iceberg, or in his cabin. Comparable feats of endurance, such as the Solar Impulse mission, have also seen people remain in isolation for days, but Mr Bellini will have to cope for a whole 365 by himself. In addition to his mental health, he'll also workout on board to stay in good physical shape. A natural lighting system will maintain his circadian rhythm, while he'll be writing to keep himself entertained - in addition to reading books on psychology. His goal is to see an iceberg ‘in the last phase of its long life,’ observing the changes that occur as it melts into the ocean. 'This adventure is about waiting for something to happen,' Mr Bellini told Outside Online. 'But I knew since the beginning I needed to minimise the risk. ‘An iceberg can flip over, and those events can be catastrophic.' His mobile home will be designed by aeronautical engineer Julian Sharpe, founder of Survival Capsule, whose creations were originally intended to be used in disaster zones such as areas vulnerable to tsunamis. But the indestructible and lightweight design appealed to Mr Bellini, and he now plans to use one for his own project. The capsule is also buoyant, so if he somehow finds himself in the sea, he will be able to float until he is rescued. Mr Bellini (pictured left), 36, is currently seeking funding for his project, called Adrift , which he hopes to begin in November 2016 near Greenland (right). His goal is to see an iceberg ‘in the last phase of its long life,’ observing the changes that occur as it melts into the ocean . One of the most intriguing features of the capsule is that the entire interior can be mounted on roller balls and rotate, even if the exterior is tossed and turned. On an iceberg, this might prove vital. As an iceberg melts, its centre of mass can change dramatically until, in a matter of seconds, the whole thing flips over. Mr Bellini’s plan is to place his capsule on top of an iceberg and stay there but, if the iceberg were to flip, he could quite suddenly find his capsule thrown into the air. If the interior was on roller balls, though, this could alleviate some of the sudden movements. He also plans to use sensors to detect tremors in the iceberg, suggesting it might be about to flip, so he can get himself into a safe bracing position.

And as it melts, it’s also possible the capsule could fall down a crack, or find itself encased under thousands of tons of ice. In case he does become stuck somewhere, Mr Bellini will have a beacon on board so rescuers can locate him, while the capsule will also be equipped with Wi-Fi, a wind generator and solar panels. Despite the hardships, Mr Bellini feels there is an important goal - bringing the issues of global warming and climate change to people’s attention. ‘Adrift has the purpose of raising awareness and bringing contribution to the long discussed global warming and climate change theories, inspire students all over the world with educational programmes and inspire to live more sustainably,’ he said on his website.

"Crash investigators have released a photo that reveals the aftermath of a plane’s dramatic landing at East Midlands Airport. A set of wheels broke off the Boeing 737 moments after it touched down at the airport, near Derby, causing the cargo plane to skid along the runway for 380ft before coming to a stop. It happened as the plane delivered 10 tonnes of freight, including dangerous goods, on an Air Contractors flight that originated in Athens and included a stopover at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. The cargo planes left main landing gear detached due to heat damage to chrome plating, a report said . The plane’s 38-year-old captain and co-pilot escaped injury, and there were no passengers on board when the left main landing gear detached. The plane, manufactured in 1990, suffered significant damage to its left wing and engine as it slid along the runway in darkness on the morning of April 29, 2014, according to an Air Accidents Investigation Branch report. As the plane landed its speed was reduced and the co-pilot handed control to the captain, who pressed on the brakes twice to disengage the autobrake system. The touchdown was ‘unremarkable’ and the autobrake functioned normally, according to the report, but the left main landing gear came off when an inner cylinder, just above the axle, fractured as a result of heat damage to chrome plating. The report stated: ‘The aircraft shuddered and rolled slightly left-wing-low as the lower part of the main landing gear detached.’ It said that the source of the heat could not be determined. The report cited concerns about communications between air traffic control and other agencies . As the plane came to a stop its flight crew feared that it would burst into flames, with the co-pilot and the pilot of a different plane reporting smoke to air traffic control. The report stated: ‘The co-pilot saw some smoke drift past the aircraft as it came to a halt. The commander … had reached the conclusion that one of the main landing gear legs had failed, but as a result of the other pilot’s transmission, he was also concerned that the aircraft might be on fire.’ The captain shut down the engines and switched off the battery as firefighters attended the scene, but the plane did not catch fire. Firefighters placed a ladder against the door to allow the captain and co-pilot to disembark, and they sprayed foam around the landing gear and engine as a precaution. The report cited concerns about communications between air traffic control and other agencies, and said the airport operator issued a safety bulletin with a reminder of emergency protocols and procedures. The landing gear overhaul company carried out a review as a precaution, as it was not clear how or when the chrome plating damage occurred.","Boeing 737 cargo plane was carrying 10 tonnes of freight when it landed .

"Britain is likely to face a second election shortly after May 7 because of a knife-edge outcome, political experts have warned. The likelihood of another coalition lasting five years has been dismissed as miniscule by a leading academic. A second election swiftly after polling day is 'extremely likely', Professor Paul Whiteley of the University of Essex said. Britain is likely to face a second election shortly after May 7 because of a knife-edge outcome, political experts have warned . 'I don't see another coalition government lasting five years,' he said at a briefing by polling experts on the latest election forecasts. Other experts also warned that a 'messy and unstable' left-wing alliance was likely to be in power even if the Conservatives won more seats or a greater share of the vote. Mr Whiteley predicted a repeat of the disastrous Left-wing Lib-Lib pact of the 1970s. It ended with Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan losing a vote of no confidence. 'That was not very successful. It had to go to the IMF for a bail out and there were huge industrial problems.' The disastrous pact led to the rise of Margaret Thatcher and the Tories held on to power for another 18 years. Experts said the likeliest outcome at the general election would be the Conservatives winning the most votes, but a left-wing alliance forming to keep them out of power. Oxford academic Stephen Fisher said there was a high chance Labour would form either a minority government or coalition with the help of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Greens or other minor parties. There was 'only a 42 per cent chance of a Conservative-led government, even though there is a two-thirds chance of the Tories being the largest party, on votes or seats.' He added: 'The single most likely outcome is…a seriously hung parliament with the Conservatives as clearly the largest party but a majority on the left, including the SNP and Liberal Democrats.' David Cameron answers questions from 02 employees  in Leeds this afternoon ahead tonight's 'Challengers' television debate . Labour leader Ed Miliband addresses supporters during a visit to Crouch End  in north London this morning . This would be a 'messy and unstable situation' and it was 'not clear that this diverse group of parties would be able to sustain a stable government'. The Conservatives would probably turn to the DUP first and then the Lib Dems to try and form a government but they were still likely to be short of a majority, he added. The SNP's surge in Scotland was likely to be hugely damaging for Labour but Ed Miliband could still walk into Number 10 propped up by an alliance of left-leaning parties. A massive landslide to the SNP was inevitable, with the party winning at worst six times more seats than it currently holds or at best nine times more. Labour's disastrous performance in the Scottish polls could mean the party only has one safe seat: the Glasgow seat of Willie Bain. John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said the SNP vote surge was nothing new. Some 45 per cent of Scots had voted for the SNP in the 2011 Scottish parliamentary elections, 45 per cent voted in favour of independence during last year's Scottish referendum and the polls were now showing 45 per cent supported the SNP. But for the first time Scottish voters were voting the same way at a Westminster election as they would for the Scottish parliament.","Second election after polling day is 'extremely likely', academics claim .

"Obesity risk: Sugary dishes are being promoted by the Government's flagship anti-obesity initiative . Dishes that contain 'shocking' amounts of sugar are being promoted as healthy eating options by the Government's flagship anti-obesity initiative. Change4Life, which is being run by Public Health England to help address the country's obesity crisis, is promoting dishes on its website with up to 29g of sugar per serving – about seven teaspoons' worth. Its Apricot Bread Pudding has slightly more sugar than a Snickers bar, which has 27g. A Banana and Apricot Bagel, promoted as a breakfast, has more sugar than a bowl of Frosties – a cereal so sugary Labour's health spokesman Andy Burnham once said he would consider banning it. Two other dishes, Banana and Sultana Bread and Butter Pudding, and Banana Muffins, contain 25g per serving. Cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra, of campaign group Action On Sugar, said he found the advice 'disturbing' and that Change4Life was 'legitimising unhealthy foods'. He added: 'One has to seriously ask whether Change4Life is fit for purpose when it's promoting foods with shocking levels of sugar.' Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: 'The majority of these recipes are fruit-based. 'Fruit naturally contains sugar – but it is the sugar that is added to food that we eat too much of. Fruit is a healthier choice.' But Dr Malhotra pointed out that recent research had found even fruit sugars could be harmful in large quantities, particularly to those at risk of type 2 diabetes.

It did not take long before the Prime Minister came under fire from his political opponents for not taking part. Mr Miliband accused the Prime Minister of refusing to turn up to answer for his time in government, while Ukip's Nigel Farage said it was a 'great shame' that Mr Cameron was a no-show.

"A former U.S. Marine who lost his right leg and several fingers in an explosion in Afghanistan is making a second attempt to scale Mount Everest to inspire others like him, a year after an avalanche that killed 16 Sherpa guides stopped him at the base camp. Former Staff Sgt.

'My message is anything is possible. It is just not me being an amputee, but anyone sitting on the couch around the world that has problems - you can overcome life, it is just how determined you are,' Linville said in Kathmandu on Friday, on his way to Tibet in neighboring China, from where he will set out on Everest.

He was an explosives expert serving in Afghanistan in 2011, when he went to investigate an explosion that wounded his colleague. He was hit by another explosive device and seriously wounded, and two years later, had his right leg amputated below the knee. He retired from service and has been climbing since with The Heroes Project, a nonprofit organization that helps wounded veterans. Taking the lead: Linville, 29, from Boise, Idaho, who lost his right leg and several fingers in an explosion in Afghanistan is making a second attempt to scale Mount Everest to inspire others like him . High-tech: He is using a specially designed metal foot outfitted with a climbing boot and another one with crampons in his quest to conquer the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit next month . Everest would be his highest and toughest mountain that he has attempted to climb. His quest last year was thwarted following the deaths of 16 Sherpa guides in April, the beginning of the climbing season, when an avalanche swept down. At the time, Linville was at the base camp at 5,360 meters (17,595 feet). This time, he plans to approach from the northern, Tibetan side, together with the Heroes Project's founder Tim Wayne Medvetz and an eight-member team. 'The only difference between me and any climber on the mountain is that I am missing one limb and I have to deal with metal,' he said.","Former Staff Sgt.

"A 23-year-old student who was attending the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was struck and killed by a freight train just a few miles away from the event's California site, police said on Monday. Jannik Andersen, a student at the University of Colorado, was hit by the train in the 45000 block of Pacific Street in Indio, four miles north-east of Coachella's grounds, shortly after 3am on Saturday. He was pronounced dead less than 40 minutes later. Police have launched an investigation into the incident. It remains unclear why Andersen was on the train tracks instead of at the music festival. Tragic: Jannik Andersen (pictured), an attendee at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was struck and killed by a freight train just a few miles away from the event's California site, police said on Monday . Farewell: On Monday night, Mac DeMarco, a performer at the festival, took to Twitter to pay his respects to the fan, who was struck by a Union Pacific train. He told his 78,000 followers: 'RIP Jannik Andersen' Speaking to the Daily Camera,  Sergeant Deborah Gray, of Riverside coroner's office said it was too early to determine whether alcohol or drugs were involved in the Boulder student's tragic death. On Monday, friends were paying tribute to Andersen, who was  a non-degree seeking Continuing Education student from San Diego. They described him as a 'genuine' and always 'happy' man. Zac Hoffman, who also attends the university in Boulder, told the news site that the student was the 'happiest dude in the world', while Cody Cooper said he was 'the most genuine and energetic' friend. Cooper added that Andersen had previously attended Coachella, and was especially excited to be joining the tens of thousands of people watching AC/DC and Mac DeMarco at this year's event. 'He had the wildest and strangest taste in music, but they were always great tunes,' he said.

"The son of a Labour councillor who was stopped at the Turkish border and arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences has been released without charge. Waheed Ahmed, the 21-year-old son of councillor Shakil Ahmed, was accused of trying to sneak into Syria  with eight of his relatives and was arrested when he landed in the UK earlier this week. Greater Manchester Police confirmed that six people - a 21-year-old man arrested at Birmingham Airport, two women and two men aged between 22 and 47 held at Manchester Airport, plus a 30-year-old man arrested in the Rochdale area, have been released without charge. Scroll down for video . Released: Waheed Ahmed, the 21-year-old son of councillor Shakil Ahmed, has been released without charge . University student Waheed, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, and eight of his relatives - including four children ranging from a one-year-old baby to an 11-year-old - were stopped on the Turkish border with Syria on April 1. They were arrested by Turkish police within walking distance of the border in the town of Reyhanli. Waheed was deported by the Turkish authorities and flown back to Britain on a plane packed with holidaymakers on April 14. He was held at Birmingham Airport by anti-terrorism police. The following day, four of his family members - two women aged 22 and 47, and two men aged 22 and 24, were held at Manchester Airport after being brought back to the UK from Turkey. Late on Monday, a 30-year-old man from Rochdale was arrested. Waheed Ahmed, 21,  is the son of Rochdale Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed (pictured above with Ed Miliband) Waheed Ahmed, a university student from Rochdale, Greater Manchester was arrested at Birmingham Airport . The four children on the trip aged one, three, eight and 11, have also been flown back to the UK. Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed arriving back at his home today bur he refused to comment on his son's arrest . Police have said the six people arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism have been released without charge. A force statement read: 'No evidence was uncovered to suggest any imminent threat to the communities of Rochdale or the UK.' Waheed's father Shakil Ahmed, a bakery delivery driver who has been pictured with party leader Ed Miliband, is a councillor in Rochdale. Earlier this month, Mr Ahmed told the Daily Mail he believed his son had been on holiday with other relatives when they were stopped. In a statement Councillor Shakil Ahmed said: 'My son is a good Muslim and his loyalties belong to Britain, so I don't understand what he's doing there. 'If I thought for a second that he was in danger of being radicalised, I would have reported him to the authorities. 'He's studying a degree in politics and sociology at Manchester University and has a good future ahead of him.' The territory on the Syrian side of the stretch of border that they were attempting to cross is controlled by the Nusra Front, the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda. Greater Manchester Police and the North West Counter Terrorism Unit began an investigation after news of the arrests emerged. Five houses, including that of Ahmed’s father, were searched as part of attempts to establish why the group apparently tried to enter Syria. Shakil refused to comment when he was contacted by MailOnline today.

"The first robot to be sent into the radioactive reactor of Fukushima nuclear power plant has stalled just three hours into its mission. These incredible pictures offer the first glimpse into the melted reactors at the Japanese plant after the 2011 nuclear disaster. More than 300,000 people had to be evacuated after three of Fukushima's six reactors blew up following the huge tsunami which devastated the country over three years ago. Nearly 16,000 people lost their lives in the natural disaster and subsequent devastation. Scroll down for video . These are the first incredible pictures inside the melted nuclear reactor at Fukushima  power plant after the 2011 disaster . The photographs were captured as part of the robot's mission to inspect melted fuel in one of the reactors . The photographs were captured as part of the robot's mission to inspect melted fuel in one of the reactors. Developed by Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy and the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning, it was supposed to be able to function for about 10 hours at levels of radiation which would be fatal to humans and cause ordinary electronic devices to malfunction. But decommissioning work at the plant suffered a setback after the adaptable 'transformer' robot stalled  before it could complete its operation and had to be abandoned. A second robot mission scheduled for Monday was postponed as engineers investigated the cause of the malfunction. The Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant, admitted the robot had only completed two-thirds of Friday's planned mission inside the Unit 1 containment vessel before it failed. But the company said it had collected enough data to indicate there was path to send robots deeper into the reactor. It leaves the door open to a new generation of remote-controlled robot missions which may finally reveal the residue of the melted fuel for the first time since the 2011 disaster. But it stalled before it could complete its operation and had to be abandoned. A second robot mission scheduled for Monday was postponed as engineers investigated the cause of the malfunction . The Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant, admitted the robot had only completed two-thirds of Friday's planned mission inside the Unit 1 containment vessel before it failed . TEPCO spokesman Teruaki Kobayashi said the robot sufficiently collected temperature, radiation levels and images from parts of the platform just below the reactor core's bottom by the time it got stuck and became unrecoverable. Mr Kobayashi said the test also showed the robot tolerated radiation and that the radiation levels were significantly lower than anticipated. That means robots can last longer and some wireless device may even be usable, even though the radiation levels were way too high for humans to enter the area, even wearing protective gear. Although there were no fatalities from radiation exposure, 300,000 residents were moved from a 20-mile radius of the nuclear plant. In total there were nearly 16,000 deaths reported from the natural disaster and subsequent devastation. Three of the six reactors blew up when a tsunami measuring 9 on the Richter scale hit the region. Clean-up expected to take decades, and cost more than £18 billion. An investigation panel deduced the disaster had major elements of being 'man-made,' and there was a ''culture of complacency about nuclear safety and poor crisis management.' Data will be used to improve future damage assessments, which are crucial to the safe decommissioning of the plant damaged by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. TEPCO plans to send in a different, amphibious robot next year for further investigation of the three reactors that suffered meltdowns. Computer simulation and cosmic ray examinations have shown that almost all fuel rods in the Unit 1 reactor have melted, breached the core and are now lying at the bottom of the containment chamber. The nuclear plant is still being taken apart, and it is estimated it will take decades to make the area safe, as well as cost billions of pounds. With soil and water contaminated, nobody can live there yet, and it is unknown when the clean-up mission will be completed. Reports found that few cancers would be expected as a result of accumulated radiation exposures, although people in the area worst affected by the accident may have a slightly higher risk of developing certain cancers such as leukemia, solid cancers, thyroid cancer and breast cancer. Surveys show only a fifth of former residents want to return to living in the area. The plant has six reactors, three of which were offline when disaster struck on March 11, 2011. More than 300,000 people had to be evacuated after three of Fukushima's six reactors blew up following the huge tsunami which devastated the country over three years ago . Nearly 16,000 people lost their lives in the natural disaster and subsequent devastation . A magnitude-9.0 earthquake triggered a huge tsunami which swept into the plant and knocked out its backup power and cooling systems, leading to meltdowns at the three active reactors. The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission found the nuclear disaster was 'manmade' and that its direct causes were all foreseeable. It stated that it had also failed to meet the most basic safety requirements, such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans. Decommissioning and dismantling all six reactors is a delicate, time-consuming process that includes removing the melted fuel from a highly radioactive environment, as well as all the extra fuel rods, which sit in cooling pools at the top of the reactor buildings. Workers, who wear protective suits when dismantling the plant, must determine the exact condition of the melted fuel debris and develop remote-controlled and radiation-resistant robotics to deal with it. The process is expected to take at least 40 years. Contamination levels are low, which means people can, for a limited time, view the destruction site .

"Like many twins, they are dressed alike, right down to their pink and white bootees. But Kendall and Baylee are no ordinary twins. They are one in a million. An amazing quirk of genetics means that one sister has black skin and the other is white. Father Curtis Martin and mother Rebecca Horton cradle twins Kendall (centre left) and Baylee (centre right) who were born with very different skin tones thanks to a rare quirk of genetics . Miss Horton, 28, is white, while Mr Curtis, 24, is half Jamaican. Their twins' skin contrast is possible because the girls are non-identical, though it is still highly unlikely . The effect is so striking that even their own father has said it is hard to believe that they are related. And their mother, Rebecca Horton, said: ‘When they were born, we kept staring at both of them – we couldn’t believe it. ‘It was a lovely feeling and a big shock. ‘One thing I know for sure is that family and friends won’t ever struggle to tell them apart.’ The little girls’ contrasting looks can be traced back to their parents. Their father, Curtis Martin, is half-Jamaican, while their mother is white. As non-identical twins, they were created when two eggs were fertilised by two sperm. This means they have inherited different genes from their parents. Normally, you would expect both to inherit a mix of black and white genes and be born with a similar skin tone. Mr Curtis says that the couple do get looks when they are out in public with the girls, and admits that if he saw somebody with them, he would struggle to believe they were related . The girls also have very different personalities, as well as different skin tones. Kedall (left) is very relaxed and likes to sleep a lot, but Baylee (right) cries a lot and demands lots of attention . But, in odds of a million to one, Baylee has inherited a set of genes for white skin. And Kendall’s genetic inheritance includes some genes that code for black skin, passed on from her mixed-race father. The twins also have very different characters. Kendall, who weighed 6lb 1oz when she was born three months ago, is very laid-back and likes nothing more than to sleep the day away. The pair say that since having twins they have forgotten what it feels like to have a good night's sleep, but say they wouldn't have it any other way . In contrast, Baylee, who was slightly heavier at 6lb 5oz , is ‘loud and needy’ and loves attention. This could come in useful, as she and her sister are already attracting attention wherever they go. Their mother, a 28-year-old delivery driver for Asda, said: ‘When people look in the pram and see that one is darker than the other, they will sometimes be a bit thrown and ask if they are twins. ‘They are shocked when we say yes.’ Mr Martin, a 24-year-old builder from Kingswinford in the West Midlands, told the Sun: ‘Everybody loves them. ‘We’ve got used to it but you hear people whisper as we walk past. ‘If I saw them out, I don’t think I’d believe they were related.’ The couple, who also have a five-year-old son called Coby, knew from quite early on in the pregnancy that Rebecca was having twins. However, they weren’t prepared for how much work would be involved. But while they have completely forgotten what it is like to have a good night’s sleep, they wouldn’t have it any other way. Allan Pacey, a Sheffield University fertility doctor, said that just as twins can have different hair or eyes, they can also be born with skin of different colours. And just as a baby’s hair often changes with age, with blonde hair, for instance, darkening, the twins’ skin may yet change. This could lead to them looking more similar – or even more different. Professor Pacey said the girls’ contrasting skin colours are caused by the way their parents’ genes were shuffled before being passed on. He said: ‘This shuffling has created something that is completely unexpected and throws us but it is just nature’s way of making us diverse.’ Twins can be created in two different ways. Either by one sperm fertilizing one egg, which then splits into two foetuses, or by two different sperm fertilizing two different eggs. The first method leads to monozygotic, or identical twins, who share the same set of DNA, and so will be the same sex and largely share the same physical characteristics. The second method will create dizygotic, or non-identical twins, who do not share the same genetic material and can therefore be born as different genders and with different physical characteristics. Kendall and Baylee are dizygotic twins, which explains their contrasting skin tone, though having twins with such a drastic difference in colour is still extremely rare. The fact that they share a gender is completely down to chance.","Rebecca Horton, 28, and Curtis Martin, 24, had twins Kendall and Baylee .

"The old adage that an elephant never forgets appears to be true, based on a touching video showing an Asian elephant returning to her mother after years apart. After a 62-mile (100km) trek through the Thai jungle, Me-Bai, the small elephant can be seen nuzzling her mother, Mae Yui, while the pair joyfully flap their ears and caress each other with their trunks  in the Elephant Nature Park sanctuary, in the north of the country. Me-Bai was sold to provide rides for tourists in Thailand when she was three-and-a-half years old, and didn't see her mother, who also worked in the trade, for three years. Scroll down for video . It would appear to be true that an elephant never forgets, based on a touching video showing an Asian elephant returning to her mother after years apart (pictured) It is particularly sad because females tend to stick together in herds until they die, sharing incredibly strong bonds. They are very rarely separated before the calf is five years of age. The small elephant left the tourism trade 'because she [Me-Bai] was too young [and] began to lose weight and could not carry the tourists any longer,' according to Elephant News' YouTube page. Me-Bai was recently rescued and brought to the sanctuary after a tiring 62 mile (100km) trek in the hot sun that lasted four days. The small elephant was sold to provide rides for tourists in Thailand when she was three-and-a-half years old, and didn't see her mother, who also worked in the trade, for three years. They are pictured here togeher . Asian elephants remember old friends and have large social networks of friends, a 2011 study found. Researchers claimed that just like humans, some elephants are social butterflies, while other prefer to stick to a close-knit group of friends. Past studies suggested elephants usually live in small groups centred around females and their young while adult males live independently. However, the study found that though males do live apart, females and their young actually have the sort of complex network of friends, relatives and acquaintances normally seen in humans. Study author Dr Shermin de Silva from the University of Pennsylvania said: 'Elephants are able to track one another over large distances by calling to each other and using their sense of smell. 'So the 'herd' of elephants one sees at any given time is often only a fragment of a much larger social group. 'Our work shows that they are able recognise their friends and renew these bonds even after being apart for a long time.' 'Me-Bai was nervous and wary of people when she first arrived at the sanctuary, but she quickly learned that her new caretakers had no intention of abusing her in any way,' the sanctuary writes. She was initially wary of humans but quickly adjusted to her new surroundings, National Geographic reported. Workers learned that Me-Bai's mother was working in the tourist industry nearby and its owners agreed to retire Mae Yui so she could join her young at the sanctuary. The emotional moment the pair were reunited was captured on camera. It shows the elephants caressing each other with their trunks and flapping their ears – seemingly in joy - after spending an uncertain half an hour together where the keepers thought they may be worried about being separated again. A previous study conducted at the park by Mahidol University in Thailand and Emory University in the US, found that elephants comfort each other when they are stressed by chirping softly and stroking each other's heads and genitals. These actions can be seen in the video. Psychologist and elephant behaviour expert, Preston Foerder, of the University of Tennessee, said the elephants are communicating with touch, as well as sound and sight, because their trunks are so sensitive. The duo can be seen walking and eating together happily, later in the video. After a 62-mile (100km) trek through the Thai jungle, Me-Bai, the small calf can be seen nuzzling her mother, Mae Yui, and joyfully flapping her ears in the Elephant Nature Park sanctuary in the north of the country . However, animal behaviour expert Frans de Waal of Emory University, said that it's possible the elephants don't remember each other, but are just a compatible pair. 'There is no doubt about elephant feelings and bonding, but we humans like to read the mother-child relation into this,' he said. 'It is possible the two remember each other but the video itself does not necessarily prove this.' Whatever the case, the sanctuary says: 'Now, Mae Yui's owners and Elephant Nature Park are working together to rehabilitate Mae Yui and Me-Bai so that they can return to the wild and live free.' Me-Bai was recently rescued and brought to the sanctuary after an exhausting 62 mile (100km) trek in the hot sun that lasted four days. Here the pair walk towards each other at the sanctuary .

"A new Kansas law tells poor families that they can't use cash assistance from the state to attend concerts, go swimming, visit theme parks or buy lingerie. The list of don'ts runs to several dozen items. More than 20 other states have such lists. But, the one included by the Republican-dominated Kansas Legislature in a bill that GOP Gov. Sam Brownback planned to sign Thursday appears to be the most exhaustive, according to state Department for Children and Families officials. The taxpayer-funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, currently provides cash payments of up to $497 per month for a family of four. To qualify that family must have an annual household income below $31,525 - before taxes - and assets valued at less than $2,000. Cutting back: In this April 13 photo, Kansas Republican Gov. Sam Brownback makes a point during an interview in his office in the Statehouse in Topeka, Kansas . The new restrictions, regarding Kansas applicants, have inspired national criticism and mockery from The Daily Show. Host Jon Stewart suggested that in accepting federal funds, Kansas should be forced to give up items like roads 'paved with luxurious asphalt.' 'The list has attracted attention because it feels mean-spirited,' said Shannon Cotsoradis, president and CEO of the advocacy group Kansas Action for Children. 'It really seems to make a statement about how we feel about the poor.' It is part of a broader welfare law taking effect in July that Brownback and his allies say is aimed at moving poor families from social services into jobs. In Kansas, here’s a list of what would be forbidden to those using cash assisted funds: . 'We want to get people off of public assistance and into private-sector employment, and we've had a lot of success with that,' Brownback during an interview this week with The Associated Press. A 2012 federal law requires states to prevent benefit-card use at liquor stores, gambling establishments or adult-entertainment businesses. At least 23 states have their own restrictions on how cards can be used, mostly for alcohol, tobacco, gambling and adult-oriented businesses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A few states - not Kansas - prohibit buying guns, according to the NCSL, and a few ban tattoos or body piercings. Massachusetts prohibits spending on jewelry, bail bonds, or 'vacation services.' A 2014 Louisiana law bars card use on cruise ships, which is also on the Kansas list. Kansas Department for Children and Families officials said that it's difficult to track how often cash assistance is used for items on the state's new list because recipients can use their benefits cards to obtain cash. The law will limit ATM withdrawals of cash assistance to $25 a day. The department said it reclaimed $199,000 in cash assistance from 81 fraud cases from July through February, but said most involved questions about eligibility. The state provided $14 million in cash assistance during the same period. A 2014 federal report said a check of eight states' data showed transactions with benefit cards at liquor stores, casinos or strip clubs accounted for less than 1 percent of the total. Critics question whether such restrictions can be enforced. Elizabeth Schott, senior fellow with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said enacting them simply creates an 'aura of abuse.' 'Undermining support for the programs is what the restrictions do,' she said. Phyllis Gilmore, Kansas secretary for children and families, said her state's list is a 'composite' of others and has educational value, sending the message that cash assistance should be used for necessities. 'Every dollar that is used fraudulently is a dollar that is not going to an American who is struggling,' said state Sen. Michael O'Donnell, a Wichita Republican who supported the bill. Helping hand: The taxpayer-funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, currently provides cash payments of up to $497 per month for a family of four . Much of the new Kansas law codifies administrative policies enacted after Brownback took office in January 2011, so they'll be harder to undo later. They include a requirement that cash assistance recipients work at least 20 hours a week, be looking for work or enroll in job training. The new law also includes a much-criticized provision shortening the lifetime cap on cash assistance to 36 months from 48 months, although the state Department for Children and Families said recipients rarely bump up against the lower limit. The number of cash assistance recipients in Kansas has dropped 63per cent since Brownback took office, to about 14,700 in February. Brownback said the decline confirms the success of his policies, but critics note that U.S. Census Bureau figures show the state's child poverty rate remaining at about 19per cent through 2013. Brownback said his state's list of prohibited cash-assistance uses has become a way for the left to argue against welfare-to-work policies. 'I think you're seeing the left trying to pillory this,' Brownback said. 'They're just trying to poke fun at it, when it's not what the debate is really about.'","The taxpayer-funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, currently provides payments of up to $497 per month for a family of four .

"One of Britain's biggest babies has been born - to a mum who asked for NO pain relief. Brave Danielle Davies gave birth to Harley at nearly 12lb following an eight hour labour without any drugs. Danielle had insisted on a natural birth - not realising she was about to deliver a massive baby. Scroll down for video . Daniel Goldstone, Danielle Davies and their son Harley, who weighed 11lb 5oz at birth . Shocked midwives were so surprised they had to weigh him twice. Newborn Harley from Morecambe, Lancs, weighs 11lb 5oz, and already fits into clothes designed for babies aged three to six months. New mum Danielle, 21, said: 'All the midwives couldn't believe how big he was, he was the talk of the hospital. 'They had to put him on the scales a number of times, they said he was difficult to weigh because it was off their official charts.' Harley caused quite a stir at the hospital as he was thought to be too large for the scales int he maternity ward . She continued: 'We have ended up having to throw a lot of the new born stuff away and he is already in size two nappies.' Danielle's pregnancy bump was larger than with her first child . Danielle's pregnancy was induced following a health scare after doctors found she had a blood clot on her brain just one month before, she started to suffer severe headaches. She said: 'It just felt like a normal headache but it was quite scary really. 'It is common to get blood clots but it is unusual to get one on the brain. 'They didn't know if I was going to be able to push with the pressure on my brain, but I did.' Danielle, who already has a 19-month-old daughter Layla, stunned staff during the eight hour natural birth, which she managed to endure without any pain relief despite pushing for two hours. She said: 'I lost quite a lot of blood because of his weight but I tried not to show the fact that I was in so much pain. 'I just cant believe I did it on gas and air, I keep wondering how I managed.' Baby Harley was born at 1.13am on April 10. Dad Daniel Goldstone, 23, who works as a security guard, said: 'I was nervous because Danielle was in so much pain and it shocked me but I wasn't expecting my son to be so big. 'I'm proud of her and all the staff were brilliant.' Daniel, Danielle and Harley with the couple's daughter Layla . Danielle is now on clexane injections to thin out her blood and doctors are keeping an eye on her progress. She added: 'A few of my friends have seen him and they all think he is huge. 'Some have said he doesn't look like a newborn he looks about three months old. 'My bump was very big and now I know why.' Former community midwife Jean Anderson, who has delivered babies weighing up to 13lbs during her career, said: 'I think many more women are now being induced early because they are worried about big babies. 'Danielle is a beacon and it shows women can deliver big babies safely and easily if they allow their bodies to relax. 'It is a big baby and I am really proud of her.'

"A gym teacher in New Hampshire has been accused of posing as a young girl on a social media site and persuading an elementary school student to share inappropriate images of herself. Police charged 34-year-old Paul Johnson-Yarosevich of Acton, Maine, on Monday with prohibited use of computer. The investigation started in December after the father of a pre-teen girl told police about the contact. Police said they determined the girl thought she had been communicating via social media with another female student around her age. Police charged 34-year-old Paul Johnson-Yarosevich of Acton, Maine, on Monday with prohibited use of computer after they say they discovered he'd been fooling a pre-teen girl into sending him inappropriate photos of herself by posing as a young girl on social media . Authorities soon learned that the girl was sending the photos to a grown man. According to WMTW, authorities then executed a search warrant Johnson-Yarosevich's Acton apartment before meeting with the suspect alongside school administrators the the school district headquarters on Monday. 'We are fully cooperating with the police investigation into his alleged criminal conduct,' a statement released Monday by the school district read. 'The Manchester School District condemns the behavior alleged in this case and has taken swift and immediate action to ensure the safety and security of our students.' The Manchester School District says Johnson-Yarosevich, a physical education teacher employed by the district since 2005, was placed on leave before his arrest. A phone number listed for him rang unanswered Monday. It wasn't immediately known if he had a lawyer who could comment on the charges. Police say he's being held on $5,000 bail at Hillsborough County House of Corrections. His court date set for May 21. Police said that, because of the sensitive nature of the case, further details would not be released until after the investigation is complete.","Paul Johnson-Yarosevich, 34, has been charted with prohibited use of a computer ."
"Prisoner Carlos Boente (pictured) was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and a phone possession charge . A serving prisoner has been jailed for making a teenager's life a misery by bombarding her with thousands of texts after he received her number from a cellmate. Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013. After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour. He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison. The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply. She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door. In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child. Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'. Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year. He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1. Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive. 'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct. 'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe. 'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary. Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman . 'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women. 'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences. 'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour. 'The woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months. The stress caused by Boente's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes, while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life. 'With this in mind, I would urge anyone who may be approached in the future by Boente, either online or over the phone, to call us immediately - do not feel sorry for him and do not wait one moment to contact us.'","Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time in prison for harassment-type offences .

Speaking to FEMAIL recently, Michelle revealed the regime that keeps her fit, healthy and glowing from the inside out. Sharing her top tanning tips for a flawless faux glow as she shows off her natural beauty in behind the scenes imagery, Michelle advised: 'Always exfoliate first and not just knees and elbows, all over your body. 'Next, I moisturise all over and then use Garnier Dry Body Mist all over my body, including the underside of my arms.' The star, who says her ultimate beauty secrets are simply drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed, also swears by LVL eyelash treatments. LVL, which stands for length, volume and lift, flicks, curls and straightens lashes from the roots up so they appear much longer. 'It helps make my lashes darker and more voluminous,' says Michelle of the treatment, which takes an hour and a half and lasts over two months.

The star, 27, says she's always been a fan of the range and has been using it for years so when they asked her to work with them, she was 'over the moon' The star also spoke about how important looking good was to her and how she takes a 'less is more' approach to make-up. Her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin.

The flawless star, who found fame on Coronation Street, reveals that her simple but effective beauty secrets are  drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed . The actress likes to snack on fruit, nuts and her favourite treat: popcorn. Bodywise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and whilst there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout. 'I've been very busy at the moment but if I have time, I go to the gym 3-4 times per week.' She doesn't, however, do any cardio and simply sticks to weight training to tone up. 'Cardio is good for getting you sweating but it slims you down and I think it makes me look too skinny,' she admitted. She also swears by the 8-minute abs YouTube video, which she does when she gets home from the gym. As for the future, Michelle says she 'may consider' doing an accessories and jewellery range but for now, she's focussing on her acting duties. 'I start filming next week for new movie,' she revealed. 'I am also in talks for another film, so fingers crossed it will go well.'

"The world's youngest DJ who is just two years old has a dedicated following of thousands of fans thanks to his ability to work the decks. Oratilwe Hlongwane, whose DJ name is AJ, is still learning to put together words but the toddler is already able to select and play music from a laptop and has become a phenomenon in South Africa. His capabilities have even earned him special appearances and sponsorship deals with fans desperate to hear his bass-heavy house music. Two-year-old Oratilwe Hlongwane, from Johannesburg, South Africa, whose DJ name is AJ, is still learning to put together words but is already able to play music from a laptop, making him a worldwide phenomenon . The youngster, who still wears nappies and does not yet go to school, plays bass-heavy house music on DJ decks after teaching himself how to select and play music with an disc jockey app on his father's iPad . His capabilities have earned him special appearances and sponsorship deals with fans desperate to hear him . His recent performance at a shopping mall in his home of Johannesburg gathered a large crowd as he bopped his head to the beat, with large headphones slung around his neck. His mother, Refiloe Marumo, credits his astounding success on the decks to his father Glen Hlongwane's decision to buy an iPad for his then unborn son. Mr Hlongwane, a gymnastics coach and aspiring DJ, had planned to download educational apps to speed up his child's education but also downloaded a disc jockeying app for himself. When he was just one-year-old, little Oratilwe learned how to use the gadget and started fiddling about with his father's DJ app. His parents were blown away when their son, who still wears nappies, repeated what he had learned on the app on actual DJ equipment, playing with sound effects and bouncing between songs. A mobile phone recording of him playing music was shared online and the youngster now has nearly 25,000 Facebook fans.

The youngster, who still wears nappies and cannot yet talk fully, already has nearly 25,000 Facebook fans . However, as well as a legion of fans, his newfound fame has also brought criticism, with some people accusing his parents of abuse and profiting from their child's precocious ability. Mr Hlongwane said he would not 'exploit his kid' and said the youngster wasn't allowed to play in clubs or at parties due to his age. His parents also insisted that they will not force their son to be a DJ when he grows up, but say they believe his affinity for electronic equipment will probably decide his future. Mr Hlongwane added: 'I can see a future Bill Gates here.'","Two-year-old Oratilwe Hlongwane can wow fans by playing music on DJ kit .

"Ed Miliband's strategy of attacking the Tories for trying to 'privatise' the NHS backfired last night after the father of a senior Labour politician admitted he had paid for treatment. Caron Wyn Jones, father of Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones, underwent a hip operation at a private clinic in Bridgend. He paid because the Welsh NHS could not perform the operation soon enough – and he was keen to get it done before a holiday. Ed Miliband's (left) strategy of attacking the Tories for trying to 'privatise' the NHS backfired after the father of a senior Labour politician - Welsh First Minister Carwn Jones (right) - said he paid for treatment . The disclosure came as Mr Miliband unveiled his General Election manifesto for the NHS. And it was embarrassing for Carwyn Jones, also Welsh Labour leader. Speaking from his semi-detached home in Bridgend, Mr Jones snr., 76, said his son, who has boasted of how he has 'kept the private sector out of the (Welsh) NHS', opposed his decision. He said: 'It was my decision against my son's wishes. He would not have wanted me to do it, oh goodness, no. 'It was the time factor because I was going to Italy. There's nothing wrong with the NHS. I'm a big supporter of it. I had my operation here in Bridgend. All profits go to the hospital. It's a private wing, it's not a private hospital.' The operation took place in a private clinic at the Princess of Wales NHS Hospital. The Labour-controlled administration in Wales has come under intense criticism for a series of high-profile failings within the country's NHS. Earlier this year, a study said Welsh hospitals lagged behind England's on almost every measure. And it is claimed the wait in Wales for an NHS hip replacement is twice as long. Caron Wyn Jones, father of Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones, underwent a hip operation at a private clinic in Bridgend (file photo) Last night, Monmouth Tory MP David Davies said the move 'made a mockery' of Carwyn Jones's championing of the Welsh NHS. Mr Davies said: 'Carwyn Jones's father is one of many people in Wales who have to go private because they are unable to get the higher standards of NHS treatment delivered in England.' Mr Jones said: 'It would be wrong to question the decisions of any individual patient, my father included. My family has regularly used the Welsh NHS. It is an institution I cherish both as First Minister and as a citizen.' Labour was under fire last night after the Tories pledged an extra £8billion a year to the NHS by 2020 if they win the Election. Think tank the Nuffield Trust said Labour was 'now the only (major) party' not to have committed an equal sum. Lord Allen (pictured) holds a £1.9million stake in a company which charges hospitals for services such as cleaning and catering . Ed Miliband has made the NHS the central thrust of Labour’s Election campaign, vowing to stop private firms making more than 5 per cent profit in their dealings with the health service. But did he consult Charles Allen, chairman of the party’s executive board, before announcing the policy? Lord Allen holds a £1.9million stake in a company which charges hospitals for services such as cleaning and catering. He earns £210,000 a year as chairman of the ISS Group, a global ‘facilities management’ firm which last year made a 5.6 per cent profit on its £930million UK revenue. A spokesman for Lord Allen, 58, said the NHS makes up a ‘small proportion’ of the firm’s business. The Labour candidate in Britain's most marginal seat was last night accused of failing to tell voters that she met Vladimir Putin in Moscow two years ago when a controversial billion-dollar arms deal was signed. Tulip Siddiq, a former aide to Ed Miliband, and who is standing for Labour in Hampstead, was at the Kremlin with her aunt, the hardline leader of Bangladesh who is accused of human rights abuses. A smiling Ms Siddiq was photographed alongside Putin and Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh and Ms Siddiq's mother Rehana. But the Tories last night accused Ms Siddiq of trying to conceal her extraordinary links to Putin and Sheikh Hasina. Labour candidate Tulip Siddiq (left) was last night accused of failing to tell voters that she met Vladimir Putin (right) in Moscow two years ago . They claimed she appears to have gone to great lengths to cover up her trip in January 2013 – just six months before she won a hotly-contested Labour selection contest in Hampstead – and her links with Hasina. The Tories also said she had deleted postings and photographs on her blog which showed how she campaigned to get her aunt re-elected. And they questioned why her 1,200-word official Labour profile made no mention of Putin, the arms deal or being a member of a ruling Bangladeshi dynasty. A Tory official said: 'It seems very odd that Ms Siddiq has appeared to try to conceal the most interesting parts of her political life.' Retiring Labour MP Glenda Jackson won Hampstead with a majority of just 42 in 2010. Last night a Labour spokesman said: 'Tulip is proud of her background and has always been very open about it.' As for the photograph, the spokesman said: 'Tulip was totally separate from any official delegation but was invited to an event with her family.'","Labour Leader Ed Miliband attacked the Tories for trying to 'privatise' NHS .
