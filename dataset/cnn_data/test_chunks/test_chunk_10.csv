"Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez is a star-studded strike force that almost every team in the world would dearly love to have, but when the going gets tough, Barcelona turn to Jeremy Mathieu and Gerard Pique. The French centre-back flung himself through the air to reach Xavi's free kick at the back post, heading home from close range, finally breaching Celta Vigo's stern defence. It was Mathieu who had opened the scoring in the El Clasico, in similar fashion. Pique, meanwhile, just a minute before Mathieu scored, had made an incredible, game-saving tackle on Celta striker Charles, to prevent him from opening the scoring. Jeremy Mathieu (right) heads home in the 73rd minute to hand Barcelona a 1-0 lead against Celta Vigo . Celta Vigo goalkeeper Alvarez Conde (right) is unable to stop the powerful header from Mathieu . Celta Vigo: Alvarez Conde, Mallo Novegil, Cabral, Fontas, Castro Otto, Hernandez, Fernandez, Krohn-Dehli (Radoja - 67'), Orellana, Larrivey (Dias de Oliveira 71'), Agudo Duran . Booked: Krohn-Dehli, Duran . Sent off: Orellana . Subs not used: Mina Lorenzo, Lopez Sanchez, Blanco, Bongonda, Gomez Sola . Barcelona: Bravo, Dani Alves, Pique, Mathieu, Adriano, Rafinha (Xavi 58'), Busquets, Iniesta (Pedro 75'), Messi, Suarez (Rakitic 85'), Neymar . Subs not used: Ter Stegen, Montoya, Bartra, Sergi . Goals: Mathieu 73' Booked: Suarez . Ref: Inaki Vicandi Garrido . Att: 23,731 . This gritty, barely-deserved triumph helped Barcelona stay four points ahead of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga, after Ancelotti’s side's almost-harrowing 9-1 demolition of Granada . Celta Vigo’s aggressive pressing nearly paid dividends, but their hard-work and effort counted for nothing thanks to Mathieu’s goal. Their frustration manifested itself in a bizarre way, with Fabian Orellana sent off for throwing a lump of turf at Sergio Busquets. For some reason Sergio Alvarez, Celta Vigo's goalkeeper, is kryptonite for Barcelona's attacking trident, as they also failed to beat him in 90 minutes at the Camp Nou earlier this season. After Barcelona's Halloween nightmare against Celta Vigo, the directive from Luis Enrique here was not to leave with egg on their faces on Easter Sunday. Barcelona's own website stated that 'a dose of retribution' was in order, after the 1-0 defeat by Eduardo Berizzo’s side in late autumn. Before the game Spanish media wondered if the international break had happened at just the wrong time for Barcelona and just the right time for Real Madrid – something reflected in Madrid’s big win at lunchtime. The Frenchman wheels away in celebration of his second half header at the Balaidos Stadium . Gerard Pique (right) and Sergio Busquets join the French defender in celebration of his goal . With Los Blancos in disarray, a couple of weeks spent healing wounds away from the Santiago Bernabeu seemed an agreeable plan, while Barcelona's momentum was disrupted. Jordi Alba was injured playing for Spain, so Adriano Correia started in his stead. Messi, meanwhile, was dragged round the United States with Argentina, sidelined because of an inflamed foot which left him unable to put his boots on. He managed to do that here, but his presence was barely noticed on the pitch. With rival Cristiano Ronaldo scoring an incredible five goals earlier, Messi was left frustrated in his quest for the golden boot, with the Madrid man four strikes ahead of him on 36. Luis Enrique hasn't shown himself to be the sentimental type, but the former Celta Vigo manager gave Rafinha Alcantara a rare start against the team which he played for, both before moving to Barcelona at 13, and last season on loan. However, the midfielder failed to impress and made way for the legendary Xavi early in the second half. Mathieu (left) is congratulated by team-mates Lionel Messi and Neymar (right) after his goal . Javier Mascherano was suspended for accumulating too many yellow cards, as is his wont, but luckily for Barcelona Busquets was fit enough to start for the first time in over a month. Alvarez turned in the display of his life at the Camp Nou and Barcelona's attacking trident must have worried it was going to happen again, when he made a brilliant diving stop to deny Lionel Messi. Profligacy was an issue in that 1-0 defeat too, which we were reminded of when Neymar slashed the rebound high and wide. Los Celestes had made the early running themselves and Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who boasts the best defensive record in La Liga, was down quickly to deny Joaquin Larrivey at his near post. It was Larrivey that put the first goal of the season past Bravo at the Camp Nou and he was determined not to let the Celta forward in again. With Messi quiet, it was down to the other two prongs of Barcelona's trident to try and make inroads. Neither were successful. Fabian Orellana was shown a red card for throwing a chunk of grass in the direction of Sergio Busquets . The lump of turf strikes Busquets in the neck after tempers reached boiling point . Neymar antagonised the Celta Vigo fans as he drew several fouls, but the Barcelona ones too with his incredible wastefulness. To watch him in recent weeks is to see a different player to the one that dismantled La Liga defences earlier in the season. His first touch was frequently poor, his passes off-target. Suarez, meanwhile, went down in the box looking for a penalty under an arm from Gustavo Cabral, but far too little contact to actually tumble. He was then booked on the stroke of half-time for a dive, although this time he has been charged into. The one opportunity Suarez got he hit hard and true, stinging the palms of Alvarez. But Celta Vigo were on top and Nolito was getting the better of Dani Alves time and time again. Maybe the Brazilian's mind is elsewhere, with his contract expiring in the summer, but physically he seems less capable too. Orellana (right) leaves the field after referee Inaki Vicandi Garrido brandishes a red card . The Barcelona players surround referee following a controversial decision . One horrendous defensive mix-up left Nolito charging for the ball with Bravo. The keeper got his foot to it before colliding with the Celta Vigo man, but the fans screamed for a penalty, unsuccessfully. The offside flag being raised against Orellana led to a Celta goal being ruled out, but the best chance fell to Larrivey before the interval. Orellana cut the ball neatly across the box but the striker, unmarked, nine yards out, lacked composure, hacking at it and sending it into the Vigo night sky. Barcelona continued to struggle, with Neymar’s goal harshly ruled out for offside and a shanked Alves shot the only efforts to their credit. Messi and Neymar react after another missed opportunity during a frustrating evening for the duo . Then came Pique’s tackle on Charles, with the defender making a super-human effort to get back and deny the striker. Celta Vigo were almost instantly punished for it, with Mathieu breaking the deadlock. Barcelona couldn’t kill the game, even after Orellana’s late sending off, with Messi scooping the ball over Alvarez but inches over the crossbar too. It didn’t matter; they held on to earn the three points and maintain the four-point lead over Real Madrid that they started the week with. And one game less for each side to play. It’s not pretty, it’s not ‘the Barca way’, but if Enrique lifts La Liga, nobody will be worrying about that.

"Club Tijuana star Juan Arango conjured memories Luis Suarez in his team's 4-3 defeat by Monterrey in the Mexican league - but it was not through prodigious scoring.

"It's the picture some England cricket fans have been waiting to see and others have been equally dreading: Kevin Pietersen back at Surrey. The 34-year-old returned to nets on Monday for the first time since re-signing for the county last month. He arrived early for the session at The Oval - tweeting a picture of the pitch with the caption: 'In the office today. £Oval' - before team-mates such as Gareth Batty and Jade Dernbach followed him in.

Pietersen was later pictured leaving the ground just before 2pm and is expected to step-up his county rehabilitation with  a three-day warm-up against Oxford MCCU on April 12. Ultimately, Pietersen is hoping to impress enough for Surrey to earn a re-call to the England side - possibly for this summer's Ashes rematch - having been sacked by the national side in 2014. England left for the West Indies for their upcoming Test series on Thursday, with coach Peter Moores leaving KP in no doubt that he still has a lot to prove - despite incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves appearing to extended an olive branch to the exiled batsman. Asked at Gatwick about Pietersen's situation, Moores said: 'From my point of view, Kevin isn't on the radar.'","Kevin Pietersen took part in a net session at The Oval on Monday .

"Brendan Rodgers conceded defeat in his quest for the top four and admitted this slide out of the elite will damage Liverpool in the transfer market. Rodgers knows he must work harder to sell Anfield as a destination for ambitious players without the lure of a Champions League campaign — and to keep those who might be hankering after a move, such as Raheem Sterling. ‘It makes it difficult, there’s no doubt about that,’ said the Liverpool manager. ‘Most players want to be in the Champions League. They want to play at the top level of the game and if you’re not in the Champions League it makes it difficult for you. We know that. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has conceded defeat in his quest for the top four . Liverpool players leave the pitch after the 4-1 defeat against Arsenal on Saturday afternoon . Arsenal have won 17 of their 20 games since Christmas in all competitions. That includes 12 Premier League wins, one in the Champions League and four FA Cup victories. ‘It’s going to be a little like this until we become more stable. We’ve got young players who are growing, getting more experience and then hopefully there will be a period where we qualify again. We want to be in the Champions League. That’s important and it is key for us. ‘It’s highly unlikely this year. But Liverpool is a great club. I said that before I came into it. It’s a phenomenal club that players want to play for.’ Rodgers starts the week seven points adrift of the Champions League places with fourth-placed Manchester City playing tonight at Crystal Palace. Successive defeats against direct rivals Manchester United and Arsenal have seen him write off his top-four hopes. ‘I’m a realist,’ said the Liverpool boss. ‘We needed to take something from Arsenal. If we’d done that then our chances would have been greater. I wouldn’t expect the others to slip up, particularly Arsenal or Manchester United. I don’t expect them to do that. Add to that, the sort of growing number we’ve got unavailable I think it will make it very, very difficult with only seven games to go.’ Rodgers will instead prioritise the FA Cup. It is nine years since Liverpool won the trophy but indiscipline is eating away at his options ahead of Wednesday’s quarter-final replay against Blackburn. Anthony Taylor had no choice but to send Emre Can off after he committed a poor tackle on Danny Welbeck . Jordan Henderson tried to argue Can's case after the defender saw red for a second bookable offence . Centre halves Emre Can and Martin Skrtel are suspended, which will not help solve the defensive shambles which unfolded at the Emirates Stadium. Steven Gerrard is also banned after being sent off against United. Mario Balotelli ruled himself out of the 4-1 defeat at Arsenal, complaining of an unspecified knee injury after training on the eve of the game, while Daniel Sturridge played and did not look confident about his own fitness after pulling out of England duty with a hip injury. After selling Luis Suarez last summer and starting the campaign poorly, Liverpool recovered, only to lose their impetus after beating Manchester City a month ago. ‘We always felt this year was going to be difficult, that was the reality of it,’ said Rodgers. ‘Our run last year nearly brought us the title. We lost a world-class player and lots of other developments happened within the club. Mario Balotelli (left) ruled himself out of the defeat after complaining of an unspecified knee injury . Rodgers cites losing a 'world-class player' like Luis Suarez (right) has made things difficult for Liverpool . ‘But it’s frustrating that we got ourselves in a position over the last three months, very close, to then come up short in the past two games. I look at Arsenal and their bench, the players, the world-class players on the field with big talent and it shows the continual work we have to do. ‘We don’t give up. We will fight right to the end. Obviously the FA Cup is a priority for us. But there’s been lots of positives from it, looking at players’ development, seeing players grow, it’s been good. ‘And, as a manager not that long in the game, it’s been great for me up to this point, learning about the dynamics of everything. We can still fight and we have an obligation to represent the supporters in the last seven games, and in the FA Cup, to finish as well as we can.’ Liverpool will meet Arsenal again at Wembley in the FA Cup final, if it all goes to form, and Arsene Wenger’s team are finishing the season in irresistible form. The Arsenal players celebrate Hector Bellerin's goal during the 4-1 victory on Saturday . They have won 17 of 20 games in all competitions since Christmas, a sequence spoiled by the aberration in the first leg against Monaco in the Champions League. There are grounds for optimism at the Emirates but Wenger has good vibes about the future. ‘We have a good mentality and good cohesion in the team,’ said the Arsenal boss. ‘There is something happening. That shows you that they are ready to fight for each other. You can see that. 'You can’t cheat on that. People smell that.That of course is a good basis, and defensively we are getting better. I think you also have to give credit to players who get less, such as Francis Coquelin. ‘But I am old enough to know that things are never as comfortable as they look. Let’s judge at the end of the season. ‘We’re on a good run and it will be down to how we can maintain that focus and urgency.’","Liverpool suffered 4-1 Premier League defeat by rivals Arsenal .

"Even by his stratospheric standards, this was something very special. Cristiano Ronaldo was back to his brilliant, unplayable best as he scored five goals in Real Madrid's 9-1 rout of Granada on Sunday, among them an eight-minute hat-trick. That treble was Ronaldo's 31st career hat-trick and his 24th in La Liga, equalling Lionel Messi's record in the competition. It also took his formidable goal tally for the Bernabeu club to 299 in 287 matches. Against Granada, Ronaldo has now scored 11 times in just eight matches. But, compared with some, they have got off quite lightly. We take a look at the clubs who have suffered the most at the hands of the Portuguese wonder. Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals as Real Madrid thrashed Granada 9-1 on Sunday afternoon . The Portuguese superstar was simply irresistible as Real ran riot at the Bernabeu . SEVILLA - 18 Goals in 12 matches . There's no denying it - Ronaldo just loves playing against Sevilla, whose defence must be terrified every time they see him. Three of those La Liga hat-tricks have come against the team from Andalusia - he scored triples in a 6-2 win at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in May 2011, a 4-1 success at the Bernabeu in February 2013 and a 7-3 thrashing in October of the same year. But they aren't even Ronaldo's best return. He scored four goals, including a 12-minute hat-trick, in another 6-2 win in Seville back in May 2011. Most recently, Ronaldo scored twice in Real's 2-0 UEFA Super Cup win over Sevilla in August. Ronaldo celebrates with James Rodriguez after scoring in Real's 2014 UEFA Super Cup win over Sevilla . ATLETICO MADRID - 15 Goals in 20 matches . Madrid derbies have been pretty common in recent years - not only in La Liga but also in the Copa del Rey (they're met in four of the last five seasons) and, of course, last season's Champions League final. In the 2011-12 league fixtures, Ronaldo scored twice against Atleti at the Bernabeu and three times against them at Vicente Calderon. Both matches ended in 4-1 wins for Real. But the most famous was in Lisbon last May, when Ronaldo scored Real's fourth in the Champions League final and ran off for that shirtless celebration. Ronaldo whips off his shirt to celebrate scoring the fourth goal in Real's 2014 Champions League final win . BARCELONA - 15 Goals in 26 matches . As a Manchester United player, Ronaldo failed to score in five meetings with Barcelona but that soon changed when he switched to Real Madrid in 2009. Scored: 417 goals . Against: 82 clubs . He scored an extra-time header to win the Copa del Rey final of 2011 and claim his first piece of silverware at the Bernabeu. And the Clasico goals have flowed regularly since - Ronaldo has scored seven against Barca in the league, five in the Copa del Rey and three in the Supercopa. With Ronaldo and Messi in a never-ending 'anything you can do' contest, there should be many more to come. Lionel Messi was left scratching his head after Ronaldo scored in the Clasico last October . GETAFE - 15 Goals in nine matches . Ronaldo really has it in for Getafe with an excellent scoring ratio against Madrid's city rivals. He notched hat-tricks against them in both the 2010-11 season and the 2012-13 campaign and added two more in a 3-0 Real win when the sides met at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez back in January. I doubt Getafe are looking forward to their last-day visit to the Bernabeu very much... Ronaldo celebrates after scoring against Getafe at the Bernabeu in May 2011 . ATHLETIC BILBAO - 14 Goals in 12 matches . Another team Ronaldo averages better than a goal a game against is Bilbao. He topped up his impressive record against the Basques with a hat-trick in a 5-0 home win earlier this season. That was the second time he has scored three against them - the other came in a 5-1 Bernabeu victory in November 2010. Ronaldo also registered doubles in a 4-1 win in January 2012 and a 3-0 win at San Mames in April 2013. Ronaldo heads home Real's second goal against Athletic Bilbao in a La Liga meeting in September 2013 . MALAGA - 13 Goals in 13 matches . Ronaldo has Malaga in the crosshairs too, averaging a goal a game in his 13 encounters with them. He has scored two hat-tricks against them, in a 7-0 demolition at the Bernabeu in March 2011 and a 4-0 success at La Rosaleda in October the same year. It almost came as a surprise when Ronaldo failed to find the net against them back in November - but he did contribute two assists instead. Ronaldo wheels away in celebration after scoring against Malaga back in January 2010 . CELTA VIGO - 12 goals in six matches . Ronaldo's best scoring ratio is against Celta Vigo where he has an incredible average of two goals a game. Admittedly, there have only been six games since Celta returned to the top flight but nearly all of them have been messy. Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3-0 home win earlier this season and he also scored three in a Copa del Rey tie in January 2013. Indeed, Ronaldo has scored every time he's faced them. Ronaldo averages two goals a game against Celta Vigo - including this one in December 2014 . LEVANTE - 12 Goals in 11 matches . Levante have also served as target practice for Ronaldo too over the years, with the goals coming at regular intervals. Earlier this season, Ronaldo helped himself to two as Real routed them 5-0 at the Ciutat de Valencia. A Copa del Rey tie in December 2010 saw Ronaldo score three of Real's eight strikes. On target for Real in an away La Liga match with Levante back in November 2012 . VILLARREAL - 11 Goals in 13 matches . After drawing a blank four times against Villarreal with Manchester United, Ronaldo has well and truly made up for lost time. He has scored 11 times in nine La Liga encounters, including a hat-trick in a 4-2 home win in January 2011 (plus an assist for good measure). Ronaldo extended his scoring streak against the Yellow Submarine this season, netting both home and away. A high-five for Gareth Bale after scoring against Villarreal earlier this season. The game ended 2-2 . GRANADA - 11 Goals in eight matches . Ronaldo sliced through the Granada defence on Sunday like a knife through butter, registering the first five-goal haul of his career. He also took his impressive tally against this particular opponent to 11 goals in eight outings. Ronaldo points to the heavens after scoring for Real Madrid against Granada last season . RONALDO AGAINST THE ENGLISH TEAMS . Ronaldo's prolific scoring record against the Spanish clubs means you have to go down to No 16 on the overall list to find the Premier League opponent he has scored most against. It's Aston Villa - Ronaldo scored nine times in 14 matches against them during his time with Manchester United. He also has eight in 16 meetings with Tottenham Hotspur. But how about the leading teams in England? ARSENAL - Six goals in 15 matches . Ronaldo mustered half a dozen goals for Manchester United against the Gunners during his six seasons at Old Trafford. The most significant were the two at the Emirates to deliver United into the 2009 Champions League final, while he also scored twice in a 4-2 success at Highbury in February 2005. Ronaldo celebrates his stunning free-kick for Manchester United in the Champions League semi with Arsenal . MANCHESTER CITY - Five goals in 13 matches . Ronaldo scored four times in Manchester derbies during his time at Old Trafford - and also found the target against City for Real Madrid in a 2012 Champions League tie. His most telling contribution was a penalty at the Etihad in May 2007 as United beat their rivals 1-0 en route to the Premier League title. A youthful Ronaldo scored twice as United beat City 4-2 in an FA Cup tie in February 2004 . LIVERPOOL - Three goals in 11 matches . Ronaldo has struggled for goals against Liverpool - scoring twice against them for United and then adding another in Real's 3-0 win at Anfield earlier this season. That was his first time scoring at Anfield as the other two came at Old Trafford in contrasting circumstances - a 3-0 win in March 2008 and a 4-1 loss in March 2009. Ronaldo draws the ire of the Anfield crowd after scoring there for Real Madrid earlier this season . MANCHESTER UNITED - Two goals in two matches . Ronaldo came back to haunt Sir Alex Ferguson and United by scoring in both legs of their 2013 Champions League last-16 tie. His header cancelled out Danny Welbeck's opener in the Bernabeu and he then scored the decisive goal at Old Trafford - refusing to celebrate - after Nani had been sent off for United. Ronaldo refused to celebrate after scoring the goal that knocked Man United out of Europe in 2013 . CHELSEA - One goal in 15 matches . Ronaldo's record against Chelsea is poor - having found the net just once against the London side in 15 appearances. Mind you, it was an incredibly important one, a header in the 2008 Champions League final as United claimed their third European Cup triumph. Ronaldo towers above the Chelsea defence to head home during the 2008 Champions League final . 18 - Sevilla . 15 - Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Getafe . 14 - Atletico Bilbao . 13 - Malaga . 12 - Celta Vigo, Levante . 11 - Villarreal, Granada . 10 - Osasuna . 9 - Aston Villa, Valencia, Rayo Vallecano, Real Sociedad, Deportivo . 8 - Tottenham . 7 - Schalke, Ajax, Zaragoza, Mallorca, Elche, Almeria, Fulham, Wigan . 6 - Racing Santander, Galatasaray, Arsenal, Bolton, Newcastle, Portsmouth . 5 - Everton, Manchester City, West Ham, Middlesbrough . 4 - Bayern Munich, Marseille, Lyon, Xerez, Espanyol, Derby, West Brom, Reading . 3 - FC Copenhagen, Borussia Dortmund, Roma, Juventus, CSKA Moscow, Real Betis, Valldolid, Dinamo Moscow, Liverpool, Blackburn . 2 - Ludogorets, AC Milan, Sporting Lisbon, Basle, Zurich, Eibar, Gijon, Hercules, APOEL, Southampton, Birmingham, Stoke, Hull, Manchester United, Watford . 1 - Auxerre, Inter, Gamba Osaka, Porto, Murcia, Tenerife, Cordoba, Ponferradina, Debreceni, Sunderland, Charlton, Chelsea, Millwall, Exeter .","Ronaldo scored five times in Real Madrid's 9-1 win over Granada .

"A video allegedly showing ISIS militants destroying a historic city in northern Iraq dating back to the 13th century B.C. using sledgehammers, drills and barrel bombs, has emerged this morning. ISIS fighters can be seen hammering and drilling away at sculptures and stone slabs believed to be some 3,000 years old in the ruins of the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud, located near the Islamic State-controlled city of Mosul. The seven-minute expertly edited video, purportedly shows Islamic State destroying the relics before bulldozing and blowing up the ruins, completely obliterating the historic site. The destruction at Nimrud, which took place last month, follows other attacks on cultural heritage sites carried out by the Islamic State, which now holds a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria in its self-declared caliphate. Scroll down for video . Attack: An ISIS militant uses a sledgehammer to destroy a several thousand years old stone slab in a video allegedly showing the group's attack on the ancient ruins of the city of Nimrud, near Mosul, Iraq . As well as attacking the city by hand, hammer and drill, the video shows the group making barrel bombs which they lined up along the ancient relics inside the ruins of what was once the capital of the Assyrian Empire, founded some time in the 13th century B.C. ISIS released the video, believed to have been filmed last month, showing militants smashing artifacts in the historic city, which is on UNESCO's tentative list of world heritage sites, before blowing it up . The attack on the ancient site horrified archaeologists when it was first reported last month, and has been declared a 'war crime' by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The seven-minute video, posted late Saturday, shows bearded militants using sledgehammers, jackhammers and saws to take down huge alabaster reliefs depicting Assyrian kings and deities. A bulldozer brings down walls, while militants fill barrels with explosives and later destroy three separate areas of the site in massive explosions. 'God has honored us in the Islamic State to remove all of these idols and statutes worshipped instead of Allah in the past days,' one militant says in the video. Another militant vows that 'whenever we seize a piece of land, we will remove signs of idolatry and spread monotheism.' Attack: The video, made available by a Jihadist media outlet, shows ISIS militants destroying a stoneslab with a sledgehammer at what they say is the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq . Horrified: The attack on the ancient site has been declared a 'war crime' by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . Islamic State militants have been destroying ancient relics on several sites, daying they promote idolatry that violate their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law . It is believed parts of the footage may be from a nearby site as some of the figures in the Nimrud video appears to have rebar, ribbed steel bars designed to reinforce concrete that are a technique of modern building. However, an Iraqi Antiquities Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said all the items at Nimrud were authentic. When the destruction was first reported several weeks ago a Mosul tribal leader confirmed that SIIS had 'looted the valuables in Nimrud and then proceeded to level the site to the ground. There used to be statues and walls as well as a castle that Islamic State has destroyed completely.' 'In a new crime in their series of reckless offenses they assaulted the ancient city of Nimrud and bulldozed it with heavy machinery, appropriating archaeological attractions dating back 13 centuries BC,' the United Nations cultural agency UNESCO said in a statement last month. UNESCO head Irina Bokova added: 'This is yet another attack against the Iraqi people, reminding us that nothing is safe from the cultural cleansing under way in the country: it targets human lives, minorities, and is marked by the systematic destruction of humanity's ancient heritage,' she said . Complete destruction: The end of the video allegedly shows Islamic State militants blowing up the ancient ruins near Mosul . One of many: This is only the most recent video purporting to show Islamic State fighters destroying invaluable heritage sites . Islamic State militants have been destroying ancient relics on several sites, saying they promote idolatry that violate their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law, including the ancient Iraqi city of Hatra, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Authorities also believe they've sold others on the black market to fund their atrocities. This is only the most recent proof of Islamic State fighters destroying invaluable heritage sites. A shocking video emerged last week, showing ISIS militants using sledgehammers and AK-47 rifles to destroy walls and statues in Iraq's UNESCO World Heritage city of Hatra. In the slickly produced seven minute footage, jihadists are shown smashing shrines and statues in the 2,000-year old city. Militants are also recorded chipping away at the bases of some of the larger wall sculptures and cracking boulders into ancient city pillars, while eerie music plays in the background. The video cuts to jihadists speaking directly to the camera with one declaring they destroyed the site because it is 'worshipped instead of God'. Last month, ISIS terrorists were pictured toppling crosses, smashing Christian relics with hammers and erecting the black flag of ISIS on churches in Nineveh, the ancient capital of the Assyrian empire. The Assyrians first rose around 2,500 B.C. and at one point ruled over a realm stretching from the Mediterranean coast to what is present-day Iran. They left dozens of palaces and temples decorated with huge reliefs mainly depicting their kings' military campaigns and conquests, hunting lions and making sacrifices to the gods. Their main hallmark was the colossal winged man-headed lions or bulls, protective deities put at the entrances of palaces and temples weighing about 10-30 tons each, some of which are now at the British Museum. Located on the eastern side of the Tigris River, Nimrud was founded in the 13th century B.C. During the reign of King Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud served as the second capital for Assyrian Empire. Other Assyrian capitals were Ashur, Dur Sharrukin and Ninevah. Nimrud and some of its kings were mentioned in the Bible, the city mentioned under the name of Calah or Kalhu in the Book of Genesis. Excavations at Nimrud were first started by the British traveler and archaeologist Austen Henry Layard from 1845 to 1851, followed by other foreign and local excavation missions. The city is surrounded by a four-side wall measuring 8 kilometers (5 miles) long. Among the ruins are the grand palace of Ashurnasirpal II, as well as the temples of Nabu, the god of writing and the arts, and other temples. Among the most significant discoveries at Nimrud were four tombs of royal women. There, a collection of 613 pieces of gold jewelry and precious stones were unearthed. They survived the looting of the Iraqi National Museum that followed the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 as they were kept in a vault at the Central Bank of Iraq building by Saddam Hussein's government.","ISIS fighters destroyed ancient ruins of Iraqi Assyrian city of Nimrud dating back to the 13th century B.C.

"Ander Herrera has caught the eye in recent weeks after cementing a spot in Manchester United's starting line-up but it appears he does not actually have a clear sight at goal. Herrera netted a brace against Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon without actually looking at Brad Guzan's goal as his eyes appeared to be shut when making contact with the ball. In fact, six of Herrera's seven goals have been scored without him even having to glimpse at either the ball or the opposition's net.

"Whatever you call them, it's always something of a surprise when a game between the biggest and best teams in any country actually turns out to be a footballing classic. Real Madrid and Barcelona attract viewers, but the cynicism on the pitch can drown out the quality in El Clasico. Borussia Dortmund are not consistently good enough to make Der Klassiker a regular spectacle. English football's closest equivalent, Liverpool taking on Manchester United, is now merely a battle for the top four. But, on Easter Sunday, Marseille and Paris St Germain played out a game that not only had a huge bearing on the Ligue 1 title race, but also easily lived up to it's billing as Le Classique. Paris St Germain players celebrate their win in the dressing room after the game, after twice coming from behind to beat rivals Marseille . Andre-Pierre Gignac gets up above Marquinhos to power home the opening goal for Marseille after half an hour . Blaise Matuidi is congratulated by his team-mates after bringing PSG level with a superb curling effort from the edge of the box . Gignac fires home his second goal past Salvatore Sirigu after a mistake from Marco Veratti gave him a clear run on goal, to make it 2-1 . Marquinhos jumps for joy after slamming the ball into the roof of the net to make it 2-2 after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's mis-hit free kick . Ibrahimovic put pressure on Jeremy Morel to force an own goal just two minutes later, as PSG went ahead for the first time in the game . Marseille: Mandanda, Romao, Fanni, Morel, Lemina, Dja Djédjé, Mendy, Payet, Thauvin (Ocampos 63 mins), Gignac (Batshuayi 71), Ayew (Alessandrini 72) Subs not used: Aloe, N'Koulou, Samba, Tuiloma . Goals: Gignac 30, 43 . Booked: Romao, Fanni, Ayew, Gignac . PSG: Sirigu, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, David Luiz (Van der Wiel 34), Maxwell, Verratti, Motta, Matuidi, Pastore (Rabiot 82), Ibrahimovic, Cavani (Lavezzi 59), . Subs not used: Douchez, Cabaye, Bahebeck, Digne . Goals: Matuidi 35 Marquinhos 49, Morel OG 51 . Booked: Veratti, Pastore . In the end it was PSG who ran out winners, but they twice had to come from behind to see off their fierce rivals in a game that had passion, quality, and goals aplenty. The game was decided by a 130-second burst soon after the half-time break, in which the visitors came from 2-1 down to go 3-2 ahead, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, predictably, involved in both goals, though not perhaps, in the way that would be expected. First the Swedish star slipped as he struck a free kick at goal, only to see his nothing effort land at the feet of Brazilian defender Marquinhos, who slammed the ball into the roof of the net from close range. Just two minutes later Ibrahimovic might have been on hand to tap home Javier Pastore's low cross, but in the end his presence was enough to force defender Jeremy Morel to divert it past his own goalkeeper. It felt harsh on Marseille, who were the better side for large periods, but they were let down by defensive frailties and an inability to really punhish the PSG backline. Despite the hosts dominance of possession, the champions could easily have won this by three or four goals, such were their chances. Ibrahimovic had several excellent opportunities, the last of which saw Steve Mandanda pull off a remarkable save, while Pastore should have scored at least once, and Mandanda also did well to deny Matuidi late on. All of that without considering the chances the visitors missed before falling behind in the first half, with Ibrahimovic denied a penalty following a clumsy tackle by Morel, Pastore firing wide when clean through, and the woefully out of form Edinson Cavani scuffing a volley straight at the keeper after being picked out by a beautiful chipped pass. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (left) challenges for the ball against Jeremy Morel in the crucial top of the table clash in Ligue 1 on Easter Sunday . Dimitri Payet gets a shot away under pressure from Marco Veratti of PSG in the Stade Veledrome as Marseille looked to take home advantage . On the other hand it is difficult to remember Salvatore Sirigu making too many meaningful saves in the second half, although he did acrobatically tip a Gignac header over the bar shortly before the break to deny the striker a hat-trick. With Lyon having briefly gone top of the table by beating Guingamp earlier in the weekend, it was a game both sides really needed to win to keep up their title challenges. The result puts Laurent Blanc's men top of Ligue 1 again, and is a serious dent to Marseille's hopes. It all looked so different at half time, when an Andre-Pierre Gignac double had his side 2-1 up. The local-born hero first rose above Marquinhos at the back post to head past Sirigu on the half-hour, before slotting past the Italian shortly before half time to restore the lead. Both goals had an element of fortune, with Gignac climbing all over his defender to convert Dimitri Payet's cross, and Marco Veratti gifting him possession through on goal for the second, but nonetheless he took both well. In between was the pick of the goals, a stunner from Blaise Matuidi, who cut inside beautifully, before curling in from the edge of the box, via the fingertips of Mandanda and the inside of the post. PSG's win was marred only by an injury to David Luiz, withdrawn in the first half with what looked like a hamstring pull. But a win over their fierce rivals, and the return to the table's summit, will soften that blow. David Luiz is brought down, and the Brazilian defender was forced off soon after with a hamstring injury which looked serious . Marseille took the lead twice in the first half, but on both occasions they were unable to stay ahead for too long . Gignac celebrates his second goal, and the Marseille striker was only denied his hat-trick by an acrobatic save from Sirigu . Ibrahimovic looks on unimpressed during a difficult first half for the French champions, but his side kept responding to going behind . Marquihos wheels away after scoring his goal, which made the score 2-2 early in the second half, and changed the momentum of the game . The fiery atmosphere bubbled over late on, as Ezequiel Lavezzi was targeted with missiles and laser pointers while trying to take a corner . The home fans produced a passionate atmosphere in the cauldron of the Veledrome as they pursued the French title against their rivals .","Andre-Pierre Gignac puts Marseille ahead on half-hour with powerful back-post header from Dimitri Payet cross .

Once they have grown and gained strength they will be released back into the wild . The cubs were taken to the Pocono Wildlife Rehabilitation and Educational Center in Stroudsbury, where they are now being cared for. Katherine Uhler, director of the center, said the little creatures -  five males and two females - were healthy but dehydrated when they arrived. She said: ‘They came in at about six ounces each. ‘There are five males, also known as dogs, and two girls known as vixens. ‘We know they're red foxes because even though they're not red yet, they still have this little white tail.’ The center is spending more than $1,000 looking after the foxes, who are being bottle-fed special 'fox milk' and formula.

'We gave them Pedialyte fluids first then mixed a quart of Fox Valley formula which is designed specifically for baby wild foxes.

Goal: Soriano . De Jong was lucky to be on the pitch after a late and dangerous sliding tackle went unpunished in the first half before he finally made it into the referee's book for leading with his elbow, an action that could have seen him sent off. With European involvement pretty much a pipe dream now for Filippo Inzaghi's side, who sit eighth seven points behind fifth-placed Fiorentina, the best they can hope for is to ruin the hopes of their rivals. Sampdoria could have moved ahead of Napoli in fourth into the first of the two Europa League qualification spots but are instead sixth in the Serie A behind Fiorentina on goal difference. They are eight points shy of third-placed Roma in the last of the Champions League places. A large section of supporters continued their protests against the club's management with banners reading 'Vendesi', meaning 'for sale', along with signs with names of star players who have been sold, and a #SaveACMilan message.

A composed Eto'o orchestrated the deadlock breaker, taking the ample time he was gifted before threading his pass through the legs of fiery Mexes to a virtually lonesome Soriano just inside the box. The German-born Italian then casually slotted his shot to Lopez's right. But they couldn't hold onto the lead as De Jong's tried his luck to become the unlikely hero. And substitute Suso could have snatched the points late when his curling shot clattered into the post about fives minutes from the final whistle.","Samuel Eto'o laid on chance for Roberto Soriano opener for Sampdoria .

"A 13-year-old boy allegedly stole a $25,000 stack of cash from his own grandfather and handed out wads of notes to his school friends. The unnamed child from Medina, Ohio, gave out $100 notes in the classroom before going to a friend's house after school, where he also showered adults with cash, police said. The group of friends then reportedly went on a shopping spree after the mass giveaway, which began last Wednesday at the town's Claggett Middle School. Payday: The unnamed 13-year-old showered classmates with $100 notes at Claggett Middle School in Medina, Ohio . Medina police told the Akron Beacon Journal that the boy, who lives with his 83-year-old grandpa and his mom, swiped the money from the senior's bedside table. Cops began to crack down on the cash bonanza after teachers at the boy's school blew the whistle on the scheme, by which time the majority of the cash was gone. Officers said that, as well as the children themselves, some was spent by 'adults, guardians or associates of the children who received the money', according to the Medina Gazette. Dollar: The children, and adults who were also given money, went on a spending spree. Some $7,000 has been recovered . As of Saturday, police had recovered some $7,000 of the man's savings, as well as some of the items the boy and his friends had bought with it. Police said that prosecutors will file charges once they have determined exactly who was involved. T.J. Hellickson, the school's principal, would only say that the school is co-operating with law enforcement.","Unnamed child from Medina, Ohio, allegedly swiped cash from bedside table .

"A newly-released video has highlighted the shocking - and arguably discriminatory - price differences between near-identical products and everyday services offered to women and men, . The clip, which was created by HLN's The Daily Share, illustrates the prevalence of this 'women's tax' to shocking affect by directly comparinga variety of different products and services aimed at men and women and then revealing the price differences. Even more disappointing is that this practice of 'invisible tax' is not only found almost everywhere, but it is entirely legal in almost every state in the US - even when the products or services are exactly the same for both genders. Scroll down for video . That price could use a shave: The Daily Share found that the differences between these razors of the same brand differed by more than a dollar between the men's and women's versions . Compounded with the fact that women make, on average, 78 cents on the dollar to men, the facts prove than gender bias is more than just offensive, it's also very expensive. For example, a Schick’s Hydro 5 men’s razor was picked up for $8.56, but the women's version - the Schick Hydro Silk - was, for some reason, given more than a one dollar mark-up, and was priced at $9.97. An even greater disparity was found in the perfume aisle, where Narciso Rodriguez Eau de Toilettes For Him and For Her respectively cost $87 and $106.60. Meanwhile, a pair of Neutrogena anti-aging creams with the exact same ingredients were also found to inexplicably cost women $1.07 more per ounce - despite the skincare brand admitting that the two products were essentially the exact same product encased in different packaging. One of the few equal prices found by the video's creators was, of course, on a unisex American Apparel shirt. But when a man and a woman each dropped off the exact same shirt to get dry-cleaned, the woman was charged an extra 75 cents - and the tag even labelled the laundered item as a 'Lady Shirt'. Something smells fishy: There is almost a ful 20 dollar difference between the his and hers versions of this brand of cologne . Seriously? The presenters claim that the exact same shirt dropped off at a dry cleaners cost more to clean when a woman brought it in . The two presenters do point out that conditions are getting slightly better; medical insurance used to cost women in America $1 billion more each year before ObamaCare outlawed the practice of gender-biased pricing discrimination. However, in terms of everyday gender-taxing across the country, a 1995 report found that 'gender tax' cost women approximately $1,351 annually - a number which doesn't show any signs of decreasing any time soon. And while the shocking statistics in the caused California to put a state-wide ban on the practice in 1996, with New York City also opting to impose a similar ban on gender pricing, the rest of the US continues to allow the practice. Even something as basic as long-term care insurance costs women 13 per cent more, a hike they apparently base on the fact that women have longer life-spans - in the same way that they raise rates on smokers. 'But people choose to smoke,' says the female presenter. 'I didn't choose to be a woman.'","The clip, which was created by The Daily Share, compares near-identical products for men and women and highlights the price differences .
According to the creators of the video, California is one of the few states to have put a ban on 'gender pricing discrimination'"
"Has this brilliant 79th Masters got one final twist to reveal come the final round on Sunday? No-one would be surprised following the dramatic events of the third round, when the three biggest names in the sport combined with Justin Rose to throw the veritable kitchen sink at the cool 21 year old Texan Jordan Spieth. The young American coped so adeptly he gave up just one shot of his five stroke halfway lead and will partner Rose in the final round armed with a useful advantage. But there was just enough vulnerability shown in his finish to offer encouragement not only to Rose but Masters specialist Phil Mickelson, who will start five behind. Spieth is the third player his age to take a healthy lead into the final round. It worked out perfectly for Tiger Woods in 1997 but not so well for Rory McIlroy in 2011, who collapsed under the pressure over the final nine holes. ‘I think Jordan will cope better than I did because he was in the final group last year,’ said McIlroy. ‘I certainly expect him to cope a lot better than I did.’ Jordan Spieth carded a double bogey on the 17th but still set a new 54-hole scoring record at the Masters . At 16 under par, Spieth broke the record shared by Ray Floyd and Tiger Woods by a single shot . The other thing Spieth has in his favour is that this is the fourth tournament in a row when he has been in the final group in the final round. He won one and finished runner-up in the other two. If he wins, he will go to number two in the world and the rivalry with Rory that might dominate golf for the next decade will have begun. Spieth looked to have taken the tournament beyond everyone else when he went seven strokes clear with just two holes to play. But while Rose finished off with a staggering fifth birdie in his last six holes, Spieth was running up his first double bogey of the tournament at the 17th. And at the last there was a horrible fanned approach that threatened to trim the lead to just three, before Spieth conjured up a remarkable up and down to give him momentum heading into what promises to be another momentous Masters Sunday. Plucky journeyman Charley Hoffman lies fourth while Woods and McIlroy both shot 68 to be tied fifth and will play together on Sunday. But at ten shots off the pace they are surely too far behind. As for Rose, the 2013 US Open champion has given himself the chance of seizing another major following his astonishing finish. Pick of the quintet of birdies came at the par three 16th, where he holed a spectacular bunker shot. ‘I think it’s important to be in the final group, it’s where you want to be,’ said the 34 year old Englishman. ‘Jordan is obviously playing some very special golf but I have definitely given myself an opportunity.’ World No 1 Rory McIlroy and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods were in a five-way tie for fifth . Finally, the real McIlroy showed upon the par fives at Augusta on Saturday . What a day we had on Saturday. It was as if Rose and the big three in terms of charisma had come up with an unspoken pact and declared: ‘Ok, let’s see if this kid Jordan is really destined for greatness.’ For those who thought the runaway halfway leader had merely to turn up to claim the green jacket, we had McIlroy playing like the world number one and Tiger confounding the sceptics with a bravura display that made you feel the last 12 months had all been a bad dream. There was the glorious sight of Mickelson playing once more like he owns Augusta. And then there was Rose, who has had a lot of good days at Augusta in his ten Masters tournaments and now was enjoying one more. How would you like to see all that taking place in your rear view mirror, at this of all courses? In short, for five simply incredible hours the roars were echoing all over this sacred property and for most of that time they were funnelling in Spieth’s direction. This was undoubtedly as severe an examination as you could imagine for a third round. Just as well, then, that the creed that has served him so well already during his phenomenal 18 months as a professional just happens to be: ’Whenever the heat is on, ensure you focus just that little bit more.’ And that, for the most part, is just what he did. Only at the end did he look like stumbling, but that fabulous up and down at the last kept everything upbeat. Tiger Woods put on a vintage show, he was astonishing, electric, inspired and charismatic . Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn showed her support during the third round on Saturday . The previous 54 hole standard of 15 under was set by Ray Floyd in 1976 and Woods in 1997. But the youngest first round leader in Masters history and the man who set a new low mark for 36 holes on Friday had reached 16 under after a 70. What made this so impressive was that, for the first time, a few errors crept into his previously immaculate game. During the round he would have three three putts and his first double. When things like this happen here it’s so easy for the mind to unravel but Spieth kept his composure. At the par five second that peerless putting stroke rapped home another birdie putt and one more at the sixth. At the treacherous 9th he seemed to have left himself a difficult second shot, from a downhill lie to an elevated green. Spieth knocked his approach to 6ft and holed that one as well to turn in 35 shots. In its own way, this was the equal of his spectacular bouts of scoring in the first two rounds. So it continued. The two stringent par fours to start the back nine were safely negotiated before his tee shot to the par three 12th came down 8ft from the flag. You can guess what happened next, and he birdied the 13th as well. He would threeputt the 14th, however – and then came the next test. Phil Mickelson played like the Masters specialist to finish the third round on 11 under . Justin Rose reeled off five birdies in the last six holes to move into second place on 12 under . As he made his way down the 15th fairway, first Mickelson and then Rose made amazing birdies at the 16th to send the crowd into raptures. How would he respond? Well, at the 15th he calmly stroked a four iron into the middle of the green for a two putt birdie. Best of all was the eight iron he struck to 8ft at the 16th for yet another birdie. McIlroy, Woods and Mickelson all shot sumptuous front nines of 32 shots. Mickelson was wearing a salmon pink shirt in honour of Arnold Palmer. Some of his great attacking play had been delivered wearing just such a colour and Mickelson was doing justice to the memory. Eight strokes off the pace at the start of play, he’s still in the ball game but will need another magic-filled round today. Add McIlroy’s wonderful back nine 31 from Friday afternoon to his front nine 32 yesterday, and you would have a round that equalled the course record of 63. Amazing how the switch flipped for him at the halfway point in the second round. So tentative to that point and perhaps a touch nervous with all that was at stake, it was as if he looked at a leaderboard that showed him 17 shots off the lead and a stroke outside the projected halfway cut and decided: ‘To hell with it, let’s go for it.’ Finally, the real McIlroy showed up on the par fives, those scoring holes that have given him such problems in recent years. An eagle at the 13th on Friday was followed by an eagle on the second in his third round. He was off and running. He birdied the long 8th plus the 13th and 15th for his best-ever return on the par fives during a single round at the Masters. A poor eight iron to the 16th cost him, however, as a 6ft par putt was dribbled miserably. Another bogey at the last as well meant a 68. And so the likely list of winners stands at just three – Spieth, Rose and Mickelson. It should be some final day. It has been some tournament.","Jordan Spieth set a Masters record 54-hole total of 16-under-par .
The American carding a 70 to take a four-shot lead into the final round .
Justin Rose collected five birdies on his final six holes to go 12 under .

"Celebrity chef Matt Kemp's anger management issues cost him his first marriage and his business. One of his most shameful moments was broadcast on national television when he labelled his pregnant wife a 'c***'. During an episode of SBS's Heat in the Kitchen, Kemp was so enraged he unleashed an expletive-ridden tirade on his then-wife Lela Radojkovic, who was carrying their first child, while filming at Sydney's Restaurant Balzac in 2004. Scroll down for video . The extent of Matt Kemp's rage is seen during an episode of SBS's Heat in the Kitchen, which was broadcasted in 2004 . Kemp is pictured here with his fiancee, Christie Webber, who is marrying at the end of the year . The award-winning chef told Radojkovic: 'If you weren't my f***ing wife I would f***ing sack you - you c***.' Looking back, Kemp says he regrets treating his ex-wife that way. 'It really makes you feel proud of the human I was, not. You say things in the heat of the moment that you don't even think about until someone catches it on TV,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Kemp discusses his anger issues on Tuesday's episode of Insight on SBS. The chef is pictured here with three of his children. He said he missed out on a lot of their childhoods . Kemp (second from left) is pictured here with My Kitchen Rules judge Colin Fassnidge . The 44-year-old said he would work himself into a 'frenzy' because of his uncontrollable rage. 'I would be doing so many things that my head would explode - you can't clone yourself,' Kemp told Daily Mail Australia. 'I would get so angry and worked up that I couldn't speak.' It also isolated him from his kitchen staff who he said at the time he did not care about, but now he takes the time to praise them. One of his biggest regrets before he 'grew up' and became less 'hot headed' was not being there for the births of his children. 'Before I wouldn't take time off for work and if I did I would never stop thinking about it,' Kemp told Daily Mail Australia. Former NRL player Mark Geyer also had anger management issues and appears on Insight on Tuesday alongside Kemp . Geyer, who used to play for the Penrith Panthers, is pictured here with his wife, Meagan, who he describes as his rock . 'I didn't see my first two children get born. I didn't see my third child really get born. 'I've got four kids, I've got to be a dad, that sort of thing makes you grow up a bit. 'I want to be a dad. I want to spend time with them.' Kemp attributes getting older as a reason why he decided to change his attitude and behaviour about five years ago. The chef now works at Charing Cross Hotel in Waverley - in Sydney's east - and still raises his voice in the kitchen, but it does not escalate to 'uncontrollable rage'. After turning his life around, Kemp met his fiancee, Christie Webber, who he will marry at the end of the year. Another panellist on Tuesday's Insight is former NRL player Mark Geyer, 47, who got in trouble a number of times for violence after consuming alcohol. 'I got charged with assault when I was 22. I have a record for the rest of my life,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I didn't walk away. I never started the fight in the pubs and clubs, but I finished them. 'There was a ticking bomb inside of me.' The proud father-of-five said having children was the push he needed to turn his life around . The family man has urged people to 'walk away' from a fight and not engage in fights . The proud father-of-five credits his turnaround to his children, without any help from a counsellor. He said the anger he felt before was now being re-directed to get angry at things that could hurt his children. 'The whole reason I stopped being a mug and stopped my anger was because I had children,' Geyer told Daily Mail Australia. 'I suddenly had someone to worry about instead of myself.' Geyer, who works on-air for Sydney's Triple M, told Daily Mail Australia he was 'a volcano waiting to erupt' between the ages of 17 and 26. He said the two reasons why he acted so aggressively was because he was bigger than most people and he used his size to intimidate people. Kemp and Geyer will appear on Insight's Anger episode on SBS One on Tuesday from 8.30pm . The former Penrith player said his turning point happened when his wife, Meagan, was pregnant with their first child. He said she told him to clean his act up and become the man she had married. 'I saw the ultrasound of my first baby and it made sense,' Geyer said. 'I come from a great family there was no excuse... I was becoming the opposite of what my parents wanted me to be.' Geyer urged people who had similar issues that he did to watch Insight and start to change their lives. 'I try to tell my kids, walk away,' he said. 'If you see someone in dramas always try to help, but if they're looking for trouble it's a mug's game.'

"An elderly man has been bitten by a crocodile at one of politician Clive Palmer's golf course. The 75-year-old man reportedly believes he accidentally stood on the saltwater crocodile while looking from his golf ball near the 11th hole at the Palmer Sea Reef Golf Course at Port Douglas in Far North Queensland. The elderly man drove himself back to the clubhouse in a buggy after the 1.2 metre reptile 'nipped' him, according to The Courier Mail. The victim received a deep laceration to his shin and puncture wounds to his calf. The 70-year-old man was playing golf on Monday at the Palmer Sea Reef Golf Course, owned by Clive Palmer . Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer, who owns the golf course, gave the victim some potentially unwelcome advice on how to avoid a similar injury in future. “I’d advise people not to step on crocodiles,” he said. “I suppose you can understand how it would respond to having someone step on its back.” He also took to his Twitter account following the incident to send his well wishes to the injured man. 'I would like to wish the well-known local man who was attacked by a crocodile in Port Douglas this afternoon a speedy recovery,' Mr Palmer tweeted. But hours later, the billionaire posted a bizarre joke: 'Crocodile has been removed from all menus at Palmer properties following today's incident with a member of our Port Douglas Golf Course.' The tweets followed after emergency services were called to the course after reports of a man being bitten on the leg shortly after 4pm. A Queensland Ambulance Service spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the man suffered puncture wounds on his left calf. The man, who was a member at the golf course, was treated by paramedics at the scene before he was taken to Mossman District Hospital in a stable condition.

The veteran striker has been forced to settle for a bit-part role at Stamford Bridge this season after the summer arrivals of Diego Costa and Loic Remy. And he admits he finds sitting on the bench frustrating, saying: 'It's difficult when you don't play and then have to go into these kind of games. But I try to give my best.

"A school district has been ordered to pay $225,000 to three girls who were bullied into sending nude pictures to a boy at their middle school who 'passed them around like baseball cards'. It marks the end of a six-year case, after the teenagers first reported their ordeal to officials at Clatskanie Middle School in Oregon - only to be told to 'suck it up'. Josi Harrison, Laura Lefebvre, and Hailey Walden were all in eighth grade when they claim their high school-age boyfriends lured them into sending nude pictures to their phones. Ordeal: Laura Lefebvre (left) and Josi Harrison (right) are two of three girls who have won a civil claim against their school district for failing to support them after being bullied into sending naked pictures to boyfriends . Traumatic: Hailey Walden, now a straight-A student, left Clatskanie Middle School to escape the harrowing experience after the principal and local police chief said she would be charged for the distribution of photos . After sending one, they were blackmailed into sending more. However, when they sought help from the principal and Clatskanie District police chief, they were told they would be charged with creating and distributing child pornography. On Thursday, two years after filing a civil suit against Clatskanie School District, a judge has ordered that each girl receive $75,000 in damages. All three girls have subsequently moved to new schools. Speaking in December 2013, Hailey Walden told KATU: 'We had grown up with each other and he was always the popular cool guy that everyone wanted to date. I was 13, I didn't know. I thought that if I sent him the picture he would think I'm pretty and love me.' In total, she sent him 30 pictures, which then swept the school. However, her mother Billi Leinonen told the station, principal Jeff Baughman and police chief Marvin Hoover 'chuckled' when they brought the case to them. Hoover, she says, started reading Hailey her Miranda rights and said she would be charged. Though no charges were filed against Hailey, she claims the meeting exacerbated her trauma. On Thursday Clatskanie School District, which encapsulates CMHS, was ordered to pay $225,000 to the girls . Josi Harrison and Laura Lefebvre reported similar conflicts with school officials. Along with Hailey, they filed a $2.5 million federal suit against the district in 2013. The judge ordered a reduced payment on the grounds that the school has taken commendable steps to ensure the situation is not repeated. An attorney for one of the girls, Amber Lunsford, told Oregon Live: 'This suit was never about the money. It was about effecting change.' She added: 'Each of the girls accomplished what they wanted.' Reacting to the settlement on Thursday, Josi told Fox 12 Oregon: 'I feel like it made me have to fight battles I shouldn’t have to fight, especially at such a young age, but I feel it made me stronger.' 'I just hope they realize this does happen to people and that we’re trying to make it known in school districts.'","Josi Harrison, Laura Lefebvre, and Hailey Walden were 'lured into taking naked pictures for their high school-age boyfriends' in Clatskanie, Oregon .

"Martin Tyler has been in the commentary game for 40 years, so it's safe to say he's witnessed his fair share of blockbusters. Confessing himself as a 'chief witness' of football it's no surprise, then, that when asked to pick a favourite he is able to pluck one game in particular from his encyclopaedic memory. 'I've been very lucky to cover so many great games but I do usually plump for this same one,' Tyler reminisced with Sky Sports. 'Liverpool 4, Newcastle 3.' Stan Collymore (third left) smashes home Liverpool's fourth past Newcastle goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek . He is of course referring to the seven goal thriller at Anfield on April , 1996, which saw the two Premier League hopefuls slug it out in order to close the gap between themselves and leaders Manchester United. 'Everybody remembers Newcastle going for [the league title] but Liverpool were in the mix as well; and maybe they looked too much at each other because neither of them won it in the end.' Despite Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United finishing top of the pile at the end of the season, the game still firmly holds a place in Tyler's personal archive. Robbie Fowler (second right) rises above John Beresford to head home the opener for Liverpool . Fowler's early goal began the seven goal spectacle that Martin Tyler classed as his favourite game .

'I think if you take all the elements of why we all love football they all happened in this particular game.' With Liverpool's potent striker Robbie Fowler breaking the deadlock on the bobbly Anfield pitch after just two minutes, the outlook looked bleak for Newcastle that evening. However, when Magpies striker Les Ferdinand levelled on ten minutes it began a ferocious exchange between the two sides that few could forget. Strikes from Newcastle's David Ginola and Faustino Asprilla either side of another from Fowler continued the goalfest and when Liverpool's Stan Collymore drew both sides level with just over 20 minutes remaining the game was balanced on a knife edge.

In the dying embers of the match, Collymore latched on to a ball from John Barnes two minutes into injury time to score the seventh goal of the game; and Tyler still remembers the moment the Kop went wild. 'I get goosebumps every time I hear it because it was such a special time.

"Wolfsburg are showing an interest in Manchester United misfit Javier Hernandez. The Mexico international has endured a frustrating season on loan at Real Madrid and spoke this week about how at times his confidence has been 'left in tatters'. Southampton, Lazio, Stoke City and West Ham are also interested in signing him in the summer but the prospect of Champions League football with the ambitious Bundesliga side could prove tempting. Bundesliga club Wolfsburg are showing an interest in Manchester United misfit Javier Hernandez . Hernandez has endured a frustrating season  at Real Madrid, and Stoke and West Ham are now keen on him . Wolfsburg are looking to bring in another striker with Nicklas Bendtner failing to impress and have considered the likes of Everton's Romelu Lukaku but he would cost £30million-plus. Hernandez could be bought for around £8m as he has just one year remaining on his United contract. The German club have also considered Edin Dzeko at Manchester City. The Bosnia captain is an option for Juventus too who have sounded out his representatives about figures. City, however, have yet to decide whether they will definitely let Dzeko go. Juventus are looking to offload Fernando Llorente while Carlos Tevez could return to Boca Juniors. Wolfsburg are looking to bring in another striker and have also considered Edin Dzeko at Manchester City . United, meanwhile, are understood to have made a revised contract offer to Andreas Pereira. Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord have all made contact with the teenage midfielder's father Marcos after the 19-year-old rejected United's opening offer. Pereira is out of contract in the summer and unsure of his role under Louis van Gaal as the Dutch coach continues to look for new players to add to his squad. United are understood to have made a revised contract to Andreas Pereira after he rejected their first offer . PSG also retain a strong interest in Angel di Maria but United are reluctant to sell. PSG particularly want Paul Pogba from Juventus but his purchase will make it difficult for them to sign more than one marquee player under FFP guidelines unless they offload several of their current first team. Javier Pastore, Blaise Matuidi, Adrien Rabiot and Gregory van der Wiel are among those that could be sacrificed. Angel di Maria only arrived at United last summer so they are reluctant to submit to Paris Saint-Germain . PSG  want Paul Pogba from Juventus as well as Di Maria but Financial Fair Play rules could restrict them . Liverpool still anticipate goalkeeper Norberto Neto will join Juventus. Brendan Rodgers earmarked the 25-year-old Argentine in December as the man they wanted to provide competition for Simon Mignolet and the fact the Fiorentina keeper is out of contract meant he fell within their budget requirements. They made attempts to sign him in January but were told he had a verbal agreement with Juventus who want him to replace Gianluigi Buffon. Further talks were held last month and the indications were that the player would still be signing for the Serie A champions elect. However, his agent Stefano Castagna has grown impatient that Juventus have not yet wrapped up the finer details. Liverpool still anticipate Fiorentina goalkeeper Norberto Neto will join Juventus rather than them . 'The only thing that is official is that Neto will not be staying in Florence,' Castagna told Gazzetta TV. 'Since February 1, when it became possible to talk to other clubs, we've been evaluating offers that are interesting for the lad, in England, Germany and Spain in addition to Italy. 'There are many European clubs interested in Neto, such as for example Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain. We have not made a definitive decision, but in any case he will not accept another loan move elsewhere. Brendan Rodgers earmarked the Argentine as the man they wanted to provide competition for Simon Mignolet . 'All the top clubs have a very strong reserve goalkeeper. Going to play for one of the best sides in the world you know there’s going to be another keeper to challenge for a position.' Liverpool will check again. They want a keeper, midfielder, striker and possibly a right back for the summer with James Milner and Danny Ings among targets. Real Sociedad remain very much in the hunt for Burnley striker Ings. Although Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United have all shown varying degrees of interest in the England Under 21 international they have yet to sign him up as they consider other options also. Ings has interest from Borussia Monchengladbach among others but Sociedad have remained constant from the start. The 23-year-old knows he can play regularly there, will be watched with interest by England coach Roy Hodgson and will get the money he wants. Sociedad manager David Moyes has taken the club into the top half of La Liga and intends to build on that in the summer and Ings could prove a key acquisition. Danny Ings is out of contract in the summer and has interest from Spain, Germany and top English clubs . Tottenham, Liverpool, Sunderland and West Ham are watching Verona utility player Jacopo Sala. The 23-year-old Italian came through the ranks at Chelsea but failed to break through and followed Frank Arnesen to Hamburg before returning to Italy. He has since impressed particularly as a right wing back but has looked impressive in midfield also. The Italy U21 international is open to a move should Verona receive suitable bids. Liverpool are weighing up options with Glen Johnson due to leave and Barcelona showing an interest Javier Manquilo who is on loan from Atletico Madrid. Tottenham, Liverpool, Sunderland and West Ham are watching former Chelsea youngster Jacopo Sala . Nedum Onouha is being tracked by West Ham, Stoke, Everton and Hull City. The QPR centre-back is one of several players poised to leave should the Loftus Road club go down as they consider streamlining their squad. The 28-year-old has 15 months left on contract and has played regularly under Chris Ramsey. QPR defender Nedum Onouha is being tracked a host of clubs including West Ham, Stoke, Everton and Hull . Onuoha was signed by Mark Hughes and the Stoke boss is interested in taking the former Manchester City defender to the Britannia Stadium. Onouha is versatile and his Premier League experience makes him an attractive option for the Steve Bruce at Hull while West Ham and Everton have him on their lists as they consider various options for summer re-building. West Bromwich Albion will make a £3m move for Wales international left back Neil Taylor this summer. Swansea are willing to listen to offers for the 26-year-old who has impressed several Premier League managers over the past few years including Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool and Alan Pardew at Crystal Palace. However, Tony Pulis is keen to jump in and show his desire to sign the stylish defender ahead of what could be a busy summer at the Hawthorns. West Bromwich Albion will make a £3m move for Wales international left back Neil Taylor this summer . Pulis has been forced to play Joleon Lescott at left-back after failing to sign Martin Olsson from Norwich on January deadline day and wants Taylor to provide more natural balance to his side. Albion, meanwhile, remain in talks with potential investors over a possible takeover. Stoke want to make their loan deal for Victor Moses into a permanent one. Chelsea are willing to sell as they look to balance the books ahead of more summer signings with Shakhtar's Douglas Costa, who they tried to sign in January, and Real Madrid's Raphael Varane on their wishlist. They will also monitor developments with Theo Walcott and Raheem Sterling though neither Arsenal or Liverpool intend to sell at this stage. Stoke City have had Victor Moses on loan from Chelsea this season and now want him permanently . Chelsea are willing to sell as they look to balance the books in their pursuit of Shakhtar's Douglas Costa . Crystal Palace are maintaining an interest in Celtic defender Efe Ambrose. The 26-year-old was the subject of a failed £3m bid by Olympiacos in January and has one year remaining on contract. Ambrose, who is 6ft 3ins tall and can also play at right back, is willing to consider a fresh challenge and Celtic would sell for around £3m in the summer. They are also braced for offers from Southampton and Sunderland for Virgil Van Dijk. Efe Ambrose is willing to consider a fresh challenge and Celtic would sell for around £3m in the summer . Burnley are among clubs monitoring Newcastle loan star Haris Vuckic. The 22-year-old Slovenian, who was one of five Newcastle players to be loaned to Rangers in January, has been a big success for the Ibrox club and is discussing the possibility of another season on loan should they gain promotion from the Championship. However, English sides are also monitoring his progress with Newcastle willing to listen to offers for a player who has one year left on contract. Haris Vuckic has been a big success for Rangers but Newcastle would consider for him from Burnley . Huddersfield Town and Celtic are keeping a watching brief on Millwall's Alan Dunne. The 32-year-old club captain has amassed over 330 games for the Championship side and is a firm favourite with fans for his no-nonsense defending which has also seen him receive ten red cards in a colourful career. Huddersfield and Celtic are keeping a watching brief on Millwall captain, and one-club man, Alan Dunne . Dublin-born Dunne has been with Millwall since he was eight years old but will weigh up his options in the summer with clubs looking for cover in defence and the combative competition he brings.

"These are the horrific final moments of a 44-year-old suspect who was apparently accidentally shot dead by a 73-year-old reserve deputy last week after he fired his handgun instead of his Taser. In the footage, released by police, deputies are filmed chasing after Eric Harris, first by car then on foot, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on April 2 after he fled during a sting operation in a nearby parking lot. Once they catch up to Harris, they tackle him to the ground and order him to lie on his stomach. Robert Bates then yells, 'Taser! Taser!' - but takes out his service weapon and pulls the trigger. After firing one round into Harris, the former full-time officer drops his gun from the recoil and says in shock: 'Oh, I shot him! I'm sorry.' Harris then starts yelping on the ground, while pleading for help. WARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEO . Chase: This newly-released video of Eric Harris's fatal shooting shows deputies chasing after Harris, first by car then on foot, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on April 2 after he fled during a sting operation in a nearby parking lot . Fleeing: The deputies run after Harris, who was allegedly caught trying to buy drugs and a gun from cops . View from the ground: Once they catch up to Harris, they tackle him to the ground and order him to lie on his stomach. Robert Bates then yells, 'Taser! Taser!' (pictured) - but takes out his handgun and pulls the trigger . The fatally-wounded man, who is being held down by his neck by the deputies, exclaims: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath.' Shockingly, one of the deputies replies: 'F*** your breath.' Another calls Harris, who is black and dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, a 'motherf***er' and tells him: 'You shouldn't have f***ing ran.' Following the incident, during which the deputies do not appear to realize Harris has been fatally injured and even tell him to 'shut the f*** up', the suspect was hospitalized. He died an hour later. The footage, obtained by NewsOn6, comes as a number of US shootings  involving police officers and  black suspects have hit the headlines. Many of the suspects were unarmed at the time. In the April 2 incident, Bates accidentally fired his gun thinking that he had pulled out his Taser - as proved by the fact he did not expect the weapon to recoil, the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office said. Bates, who had been monitoring the situation from afar, ran up to Harris in a bid 'to get the situation under control', before mistakenly firing his gun instead of his Taser, according to on-site deputies. Apology: After firing one round into Harris, the former full-time officer drops his gun from the recoil and says in shock: 'Oh, I shot him! I'm sorry' (pictured) Harris then starts yelping on the ground, while shouting, 'Help!' Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the 'accidental' shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' Suspect: Shockingly, one of the deputies replies: 'F*** your breath.' Another calls Harris (pictured in a police mug shot released d by officials on April 4) a 'motherf***er' and tells him: 'You shouldn't have f***ing ran' Harris, who was being restrained at the time, had  allegedly fled after he was caught trying to buy drugs and a gun from deputies posing as dealers in the parking lot of a nearby dollar store. Major Shannon Clark told CNN: 'They were struggling trying to get him into custody, he ran up trying to use a less lethal device, trying to get the situation under control. 'Inadvertently he discharged a round from his service weapon.' He added: 'Did an accident happen? Sure. But is it accredited to his age? Or was it accredited to the rapidly evolving situation? I guess that will be determined in the investigation.' Bates, who has been a reserve since 2008, is the chief executive of Robert C Bates LLC, a Tulsa-based insurance company, who worked as an officer assigned to the Violent Crimes Task Force. Fatal: Following the incident, during which the deputies told Harris to 'shut the f*** up', the suspect was hospitalized. He died an hour later. Above, blood appears to be running down Harris's arm at the scene . Scene: In this photo, which has been partially blanked out by the Sheriff's Office, deputies are pictured at the scene of the incident. The deputy in the foreground of the frame is holding down Harris following the shooting . He has also spent time with the Tulsa Police Auxiliary. Speaking to local site News OK, Bates said: 'It was me. My attorney has advised me not to comment. As much as I would like to, I can’t.' According to Tulsa Police, Harris had met an undercover officer to sell him a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol and 300 rounds ammunition. He fled the scene when deputies tried to arrest him, it is alleged. The suspect then fought with another deputy when he was shot, police said. He was gunned down accidentally by Bates after officers 'observed him reaching for his waistband area ... causing concern for the deputies' safety,' authorities told CNN. Officers had been monitoring Harris as part of an investigation into the trade of methamphetamine. As he met with undercover deputies to allegedly hand over the drugs, he is accused of offering to throw in a sawed-off gun. Confusion: Bates, 73, accidentally grabbed his pistol and shot Harris (right, in a previous mug shot) dead, according to Tulsa police. Bates is classified as an advanced deputy. The incident is now under investigation . His convictions include escaping prison in 1990, robbery with a dangerous weapon in 1999, and making threatening phone calls. According to Tulsa Police, Harris' killer, Bates, is classified as an advanced deputy. Reserves are 'basic', 'intermediate', or 'advanced'. The qualify for 'advanced', officers are required to have a minimum of 320 hours of training and 25 hours of training a year. During the annual field training program, they are tested on how to use and identify lethal and non-lethal weapons. With the same power as paid deputies, reserves can conduct their own investigations, make arrests and work on task forces. The cause of Harris's death is under investigation.","WARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEO .

Inter Milan have opened talks with Manchester City regarding a deal for forward Stevan Jovetic . Jovetic, pictured scoring against Sunderland in December, looks likely to leave the Etihad this summer . Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini is hoping to raid his former club Manchester City this summer . The Premier League champions rejected several bids from Inter last summer, while Juventus showed interest in the Montenegro star during the last transfer window. City are willing to listen to offers for Jovetic if they can recoup a significant amount of the £22million they paid Fiorentina for him in 2013. Inter are unlikely to turn Lukas Podolski's loan move from Arsenal into a permanent one, leaving Roberto Mancini in the market for a wide forward. The former City boss also remains keen on a deal for Yaya Toure, who could be one of several players to leave the Premier League champions this summer. Inter are also interested in a deal for midfielder Yaya Toure, pictured celebrating a goal against Sunderland . Veteran midfielder Toure, pictured in action against Newcastle, is one of a number of players who could leave . Speaking earlier this month, Mancini said: 'Yaya has played in every top League, apart from Germany and Italy.

"Celtic manager Ronny Deila will try to persuade Jason Denayer and Manchester City to extend the centre-back's loan deal next season - but Hearts captain Danny Wilson is also among his defensive targets. Denayer made his full international debut in Belgium's 1-0 European Championship qualifying victory in Israel on Tuesday night, coming on as a substitute after Vincent Kompany was sent off. The 19-year-old also faces competition from Kompany at City, and Deila would welcome another season-long loan arrangement. Celtic want to keep Manchester City defender Jason Denayer (left) on loan for another season . Hearts captain Danny Wilson is another defensive target for Celtic manager Ronny Deila . But, with Denayer due to spend pre-season with his parent club in a bid to prove himself, there is no guarantee he will return, and certainly not in time for Celtic's Champions League qualifying campaign beginning in mid-July. So Deila confirmed he would look to sign a centre-back and responded to reports that former Rangers player Wilson was among his list of potential targets. 'That is one of many names we are talking about but there is nothing serious in that,' Deila said. 'But he's a good player.' Deila, who spent last week watching Norway training before their 5-1 defeat in Croatia, added: 'Jason is going back to Manchester City after the season to have a pre-season and we will see if we can get him back or not. That is something we want, but we have to co-operate with City. 'But I think it's good for him to stay here because hopefully we will get Champions League qualification and that will make him even more experienced. 'Jason is ambitious - he wants to play at the highest level he can. But it's playing that is the most important thing, and playing at Manchester City is very, very hard. If not, I think Celtic is a good club for him.' Celtic boss Ronny Deila has confirmed that he will ask Manchester City if he can keep Denayer next season . Denayer rises highest to score against Aberdeen at Celtic Park at the beginning of last month . Celtic were involved in another loan deal this week when 18-year-old midfielder Liam Henderson joined Rosenborg until the summer. Henderson has made 22 first-team appearances, but competition has increased recently with the signings of Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven. 'Rosenborg called me and asked if we had a midfielder that could be available and Liam Henderson is a very, very talented player and he needs games,' Deila said. 'This was a good move for him. We have a lot of options in midfield and he can play until July 1 and get as much experience as possible. It's a big club as well - the biggest club in Norway, high expectations there. This will give him more experience as a player and a person. 'He was quite keen and that's what good about Liam - he is so ambitious. He really wants to play and develop all the time. 'He saw this as a very good move for him and I made it quite clear that it's not as if I don't want him - it's just because I think it's good for his development. If I was selfish, I would keep him here.' Denayer, pictured celebrating a goal in August last year, is hoping to break into Manchester City's first-team . When asked if more Scottish players should experience playing abroad, Deila said: 'Abroad or not, I'm not sure what is best, but you have to learn a different culture, different ways of playing football, which is positive, and also learning a language and getting away from a safe environment. 'They are positive things but the most important thing is to get experience on the pitch.' Deila is hoping to get all of his players back fit from international duty ahead of their Scottish Premiership clash at St Mirren Park on Friday night, but Charlie Mulgrew (hamstring tendon) and Mikael Lustig (ankle) are still missing. 'Charlie is progressing, the same with Lustig, but the two injuries are very hard to get right,' Deila said. 'Things are going in the right direction but we have to be patient because if we start too early they will have the same injury again and we will be another two or three months. 'We will not take any risks but hopefully they will be available before the end of the season. Charlie is training half the session but still a long way to get 100 per cent.'","Jason Denayer has enjoyed a successful season on loan at Celtic .

"A benefits cheat who claimed he could barely walk while starring for his pub football team has avoided jail. Raymond Billam illegally pocketed £15,000 of taxpayers' money after he said he was severely disabled due to back and knee problems. But fraud investigators secretly filmed the 40-year-old midfielder taking to the pitch for a Sunday League team after being tipped-off about his fraudulent claims. The grandfather-of-four admitted benefit fraud and was sentenced to 26-weeks in prison suspended for two years. Cheat: Raymond Billam, 40, claimed he was unable to walk more than a few metres, but was filmed running and jumping as he took to the pitch for his pub football team . Shaven headed Billam claimed he was unable to walk more than 20 metres without falling and needed crutches to get around. But between September 2008 and April 2014 he pulled on the green and black shirt of Ingsfield Lane football club and two other teams in the Mexborough and District Sunday League. In total Billam of Bolton-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, played over 87 games while dishonestly claiming incapacity benefit, Barnsley Magistrates Court was told. Julie Grant, prosecuting, said: 'Over three consecutive Sundays he was playing football, running, jumping and participating fully showing no signs of discomfort.' His appearances and goals were even posted on the internet, magistrates' heard. 'Clearly this is not consistent with somebody unable to walk without aids,' the prosecutor added. When Billam was arrested he said he had 'good days and bad days' and he was so well-known in the league that others could have been playing under his name. But he could not provide investigators with a list of names. Billam admitted defrauding the Department of Work and Pensions by pocketing £15,066 through dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances which affected his disability living allowance. Chris Peace, defending, said Billam, who has four grandchildren, had worked as a contractor for Yorkshire Water for 16 years until he suffered a serious back injury in 2006 which needed surgery. He initially  made a legitimate claim and went from 13 to 18 and a half stones and had problems with drinking and gambling. 'He was in a bit of a state,' said Mr Peace. The court heard that playing football helped Billam recover from the the low point in his life. Billam had claimed more than £15,000 in incapacity benefit when the Department of Work and Pensions were tipped off . Unknown to the grandfather-of-four he was secretly filmed by fraud investigators donning his green and black shirt . Billam was sentenced to a 26-week suspended prison sentence after he admitted benefit fraud . Billam, who was taking jobs as a self employed plumber by October 2013, accepted that he should have notified the Department of Work and Pensions earlier that he was fit to work. 'The allowance was a regular source of income and he had three children at home and it was very difficult to do without that,' his lawyer said. 'It was difficult to wave goodbye to that when you have lots of bills.' The court heard Billam was repaying the money and the whole amount outstanding would be paid off. Billam was given a 26-week jail term suspended for two years, ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and he will be subject to an electronically monitored daily curfew for four months. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: 'Billam was very brazen about what he was doing. 'It's hard to believe someone can think they are entitled to incapacity benefits because they claim they can't walk far without assistance. 'Yet we observed him on three consecutive Sundays, running around, jumping and heading the ball and putting in some strong tackles.'","Raymond Billam defrauded the Department of Work and Pensions .

"Chelsea could move for Atletico Madrid centre back Miranda in the summer. The club's technical director Michael Emenalo travelled to Spain on Saturday to watch the defender during Atletico's 2-2 draw with Malaga, according to Spanish newspaper AS. The 31-year-old has one year left on his contract and Atletico are reportedly keen to cash in this summer. Atletico Madrid centre back Miranda (left) competes for the ball with Real Sociedad's Mikel Gonzalez . Miranda has also been offered to Manchester United and Manchester City, but both clubs are more interested in the Brazilian's team-mates Diego Godin and Jose Maria Gimenez. Chelsea and Atletico held talks over Miranda last summer when Jose Mourinho's side moved to sign Diego Costa and Felipe Luis, but the defender rejected a move to London – as well as United – to remain in Madrid. But the presence of Costa and Luis at Stamford Bridge coupled with the emergence of Gimenez as a regular at Atletico may convince Miranda to join Chelsea this time around. Miranda currently has a year left on his contract and has yet to agree a new deal with the Spanish side . Earlier in the month, however, Miranda rejected talk that he would leave Atletico. Asked about speculation linking him with a move to Old Trafford, Miranda told Brazilian website Estadao: 'Of course this news reaches me, and it makes me happy. It shows I am doing well. 'It makes me proud, but my intention is to stay at Atletico because I still have a year and a half on my contract.' The emergence of defender Jose Maria Gimenez at Atletico may influence Miranda's decision this summer .","Miranda has one year left on his contract with Atletico Madrid .

"Chelsea goalkeeper Thibault Courtois insists he has not lost any sleep over his high-profile errors of recent weeks. The Belgian was exceptional for the Blues in their win over Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. It was a far cry from his displays in Chelsea's previous two matches, however. Thibaut Courtois (centre) was in phenomenal form as Chelsea beat rivals Queens Park Rangers on Sunday . Courtois (centre) has struggled in previous weeks and his error led to a  goal for Hull on March 22 . Courtois cut a despondent man against Hull (left) but was back on form against QPR on Sundat . His poor touch allowed Abel Hernandez to score in Chelsea's 3-2 win over Hull on March 22 before Stoke's Charlie Adam beat him from 66 yards last weekend. But Courtois says his confidence levels have not waned as a result. 'I never doubted that I can't catch the ball. Against Hull, I just tried to make the best solution,' he said. 'It was not the best control, but in the second half I showed that I am mentally strong and I saved the team. 'Against Stoke, if you want to play high as a team, you as a goalkeeper have to play high as a team as well. Charlie Adam did a good strike and that can happen. 'But I showed against QPR that if you play high, you can go get the ball from the midfield. If I'm on the 16 yard box, I can go get it there. For me it's not a problem. Courtois has also faced criticism for failing to keep out Charlie Adam's 66-yard strike against Stoke . Courtois (right) said he never doubted himself during his indifferent spell of form for Chelsea . 'I continue. I never doubt myself. That's my strength. I helped the team with two good saves against QPR and I'm happy. 'The most important thing is the team and against Hull and Stoke we still won. 'I'm 22 and still learning. These were moments which I could learn from.'","Thibaut Courtois went into the QPR game in inconsistent form for Chelsea .

"A handful of Manchester City fans were ejected from Old Trafford for allegedly mocking the Munich Air Disaster during Sunday's 4-2 derby defeat by Manchester United. Stewards threw out the group who were said to be attempting to taunt home supporters by making airplane wings in a sick reference to the 1958 tragedy. A total of 23 people perished after a plane carrying Matt Busby's talented young side crashed during a take-off attempt from Munich after refuelling following a European Cup clash against Red Star Belgrade. A handful of Manchester City fans were ejected from Old Trafford for allegedly mocking the Munich Disaster . Manchester United won 4-2, with goals from Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling . Among the death toll was former Manchester City goalkeeper Frank Swift, who was covering the match as a journalist. However, a minority of visiting supporters were accused of performing the gesture and were quickly thrown out by stewards. Police praised the 'overwhelming majority' of supporters at the clash after just eight arrests were made. Fears had been raised over the 4pm kick-off time with some concerned the extra time in the pub it allowed could increase the risk of alcohol-fuelled disorder. Police on Merseyside had previously launched a legal challenge to the Everton versus Liverpool clash starting at 5.30pm on a Saturday but their counterparts in Greater Manchester were confident they could handle a late afternoon kick-off. A scuffle described by officers as 'minor' broke out between rival United and City fans outside the stadium following the final whistle but those involved were quickly dispersed and the match passed without major incident. Young's goal delighted the Old Trafford crowd, the majority of whom were praised for their behaviour . Police praised 'the overwhelming majority' of fans, after just eight people were arrested at the derby . Of those arrested, one was held on suspicion of ticket touting, another for an alleged assault on a police officer who was kicked in the head and a third was accused of assault. One man was arrested on suspicion of committing a racially-aggravated offence following alleged comments made about Ashley Young following his equalising goal for United. Three were arrested for alleged public order offences and another was held on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. Chief Superintendent John O'Hare hailed fans' behaviour. He said: 'I would firstly like to praise the overwhelming majority of fans from both clubs for making the derby match a safe and enjoyable environment. The disaster in 1958 saw 23 people die when Manchester United's plane crashed in Munich . 'In a stadium packed with more than 75,000 people, to only make eight arrests for minor offences without any disorder is a fantastic achievement and again is testament to the behaviour of the fans in attendance. 'There was a minor skirmish on the forecourt as fans left the ground, but this was quickly dealt with by the officers on the ground who ensured there was no disorder and the game passed peacefully. 'As we said before the game, the later kick-off was mutually agreed by ourselves, both clubs and the Premier League which is a reflection of how well the fans have behaved during previous derbies. That spirit was evident again this Sunday.' City say they are aware of the ejections and are liaising with United officials.","Small group of supporters ejected after supposedly mocking disaster .

British number one Watson, seeded 16th, gave up 14 break points and lost her serve seven times en route to a 6-3 4-6 7-5 defeat to Croatian teen Donna Vekic in a hard-fought match lasting more than two and a half hours. Heather Watson crashed out in Charleston after a narrow victory to Donna Vekic . The other seeds in action, Irina-Camelia Begu and Mona Barthel, progressed in straight sets.

"Lewis Hamilton led the way in both practice sessions for Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix. Hamilton suggested Mercedes will be back in control for this race after Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel conjured one of the surprises for many a season with the team's first victory for almost two years at the last race in Malaysia. Many people expected another dominant Mercedes campaign in the wake of last season's crushing success and thoroughly convincing win in the opening race in Australia. Lewis Hamilton was fastest in both practice sessions for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix . The Briton, mobbed by fans in the paddock, is bidding to win his fourth Chinese Grand Prix . 1. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes 1:37.219 . 2. Kimi Raikkonen Ferrari 1:37.662 . 3. Daniel Ricciardo Red Bull - Renault 1:38.311 . 4. Sebastian Vettel Ferrari 1:38.339 . 5. Nico Rosberg Mercedes 1:38.399 . 6.

Even Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff suggested Ferrari's success was 'a wake-up call' to his organisation. Without doubt Mercedes, and Hamilton in particular, responded as he initially finished 0.541 seconds quicker than team-mate Nico Rosberg at the end of FP1 when Pirelli's medium-compound tyre was used. Switching to the faster soft tyre for runs in FP2, Hamilton again comfortably had the edge by 0.443secs over Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was third quickest, 1.093secs adrift, but only after taking to the track 40 minutes late due to issues. It is yet to be determined whether they were the same problems that ultimately brought an end to team-mate Daniil Kvyat's day. As the young Russian exited the pits with 20 minutes remaining his brakes caught fire, and although Kvyat attempted to return, he was eventually forced to pull off track. Felipe Massa trudges off the track after his spin brought out the red flags during the second practice session . The Brazilian inspects his Williams after he locked up on the approach to turn 14 before losing the back end . Vettel was fourth on the timesheet, 1.120secs down, with Rosberg fifth after making a mistake on his fast lap on the soft tyres. Kvyat still ended up sixth, followed by the Williams of Valtteri Bottas, Sauber's Felipe Nasr and Romain Grosjean in his Lotus. McLaren's Jenson Button completed the top 10, two seconds down as he and the team continue to show signs of improvement, with team-mate Fernando Alonso 12th and a further half a second off the pace. Felipe Massa's session, meanwhile, lasted 38 minutes as the Williams driver skidded off the track at the end of the longest straight in F1. Daniil Kvyat's brakes caught fire when he left the pits and the Red Bull driver ended up in the gravel . Fernando Alonso looks on from the back of the McLaren garage... he ended the second session in 12th . The Brazilian locked up on the approach to turn 14, losing the back end of the car and resulting in a slide on to the run-off area where he lost the left front-wing endplate after clipping a barrier. Although Massa managed to keep the engine running and reversed his car, the endplate lodged under the left-front tyre, forcing him to abandon. It resulted in the session being red-flagged for the car's retrieval, with Massa ultimately finishing down in 17th. Manor duo Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens brought up the rear, the latter encountering issues with his power unit in FP2 which restricted him to just six laps. Stevens will be hoping the problem can be resolved as he has already missed qualifying and the race in both Australia and Malaysia due to other difficulties.

"By the time Andy Murray ties the knot next Saturday he will hopefully have forgotten the utter frustration at becoming Novak Djokovic's Easter bunny. The 27-year-old Scot has lost his last seven matches to the Serb, this one the Miami Open final 7-6 4-6 6-0 on a brutally punishing afternoon, suffering the undeserving ignominy of conceding another love set against his old rival. He pushed him hard and had enough early chances to have won it in straight sets. In fact Murray pushed Djokovic so hard that, at the end of the second set, the furious Serb wrenched his towel off a startled ballkid and screamed at his box on his way to the chair, gaining a warning as his mask of statesmanship slipped.

Murray has had a good enough week to walk down the aisle with Kim Sears having got back to world No 3, but it is now ten out of eleven defeats against the world No 1. How to seize the moment against this phenomenal competitor is a hugely pressing issue for him and everyone else. As for Djokovic, he will now be holding that distinction for the 141st week of his career on Monday, putting him on sixth equal in the all-time list with Rafael Nadal. In some ways this was a truncated version of their Australian Open final. A forlorn Murray reflected afterwards: 'Game wise, I feel like in the couple of the matches we played this year I've been able to hang with him, but just not quite for long enough unfortunately.

I played well for two sets and was struggling physically in the third. I don't feel like I can do loads more than what I'm doing to get myself in the best condition possible, I do push myself very hard.' The first set was notable for Murray's early aggression that brought him a break in the third game and should have seen him open up a 3-1 lead. But it transpired that it was desperately difficult playing into the fierce lunchtime sun. Nobody actually held at the city end of the court until the eleventh game when the Serb managed it. Murray forced the tiebreak but, beginning on the more difficult side, could not recover from 0-4 down as he hit several forehands long. Djokovic dives desperately at the net as the first set goes the distance in the blazing heat . Murray shows his frustration as his two breaks in the first set are immediately countered by the Serbian . Both stars struggled serving into the sun with all four breaks in the first set coming from the same end . Djokovic had been starting to blow hard – rather like he did in Australia – and just like in Melbourne it all proved to be irrelevant as he took it 7-3. Gauging how the 27 year-old Serb is feeling is an extremely inexact science, and you could only speculate as a brutally punishing second set unfolded in more level fashion than the break-filled opener. Murray became more and more agitated as he failed to gain the breakthrough but held on until 5-4 when Djokovic dissolved into a ball of Balkan anger. Murray broke him to love and the Serb angrily snatched his towel off the ballboy, apologising later: ' I'm sorry, because I didn't pay attention to the ball boy and I just screamed at my box,' he said.

"Stuart Armstrong admits taking receipt of his first Scottish Premiership league winners’ medal would help finalise the process of feeling like a Celtic player. For the young midfielder, a Parkhead title party next month would also help make up for the hurt he suffered at the very same venue 12 months previously. Last May, at the culmination of an exciting season on Tayside, Armstrong and his young Dundee United team-mates harboured high hopes of becoming just the third team in Tannadice history to lift the Scottish Cup. Celtic's Stuart Armstrong (right) is hoping to get his hands on the Scottish Premiership title . Armstrong completed a move from Dundee United to Celtic during the January transfer window . Following a 2-0 defeat in the final against St Johnstone, however, the 23-year-old was left crestfallen as he watched the Perth side celebrate their own slice of history on the Parkhead turf. A year on and he is part of a Celtic side rapidly closing in on a title that even Derek McInnes, manager of closest challengers Aberdeen, admits is essentially over. While insisting nobody at Celtic is taking league glory for granted, Armstrong – who joined Celtic on transfer deadline day - admits that a title party in the east end of Glasgow next month would represent a green day to banish the blues that still hang over his head from a year ago. ‘Last year’s Scottish Cup Final at Celtic Park was a disappointing end to a very enjoyable season,’ Armstrong recalled ahead of his side's lunchtime clash at Inverness. ‘We had the joy of winning the Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers at Ibrox so to then go on and lose in the final to St Johnstone was very difficult to take. It’s not something you can change, though, so you have to just live with that disappointment. ‘But winning the title would be nice this year. A bit of success would certainly lighten the disappointment of that cup final. ‘And there’s a nice little gap building now at the top of the table. For a while Aberdeen were threatening us closely but we have managed to extend the gap and we still have a game in hand. While it’s never over until it’s mathematically impossible, we are confident we can clinch it. But we won’t be complacent. Armstrong joined Celtic along with his close friend and former Dundee team-mate Gary Mackay-Steven . ‘I’ve been here at Celtic a few months now and I’ve played a few games so I do feel like a Celtic player. But I would feel even more like a Celtic player with a league winners’ medal. As a player, you want to fill your trophy cabinet up and winning the league title would be a great way to start.’ In this season when achieving just the fourth treble in Celtic’s long history is a real possibility, Armstrong, like close friend Gary Mackay-Steven, has been limited to Premiership action because of his involvement in the cups with United earlier this season. His League Cup-winning team-mates return to Hampden next Sunday to face Inverness in the Scottish Cup semi finals and, while being on the outside for cup ties is undeniably frustrating, Armstrong believes arriving in January has been of huge benefit in other ways. In particular, he feels walking out to a wall of sound at Parkhead against Inter Milan in the Europa League in February will have left himself and Mackay-Steven ready to hit the ground running in the Champions League qualifiers in July. ‘It would be bizarre to maybe only be part of one part of a Treble - but it’s also exciting to be part of a team who are capable of doing it,’ he said. ‘I’d have loved to have been involved in all the big matches but that’s just the way it is. As it is, we have the chance of the title this year – and I’m sure there will be chances for other medals next year. ‘But I definitely feel part of it at Celtic now. Myself and Gary have settled in really well. It was nice people were saying myself and Gary were worthy of being in contention for Scotland but it was nice to get away to Dubai for a few days of sun during the international break and to come back fresh. Even if it felt wrong not having my friend Gary there in Dubai with me, since we’re always together! Kris Commons scored in Celtic's recent Scottish Premiership 2-0 win over Partick Thistle . ‘But being in Dubai to relax let me reflect on everything that’s happened since January. Yes, it’s a little frustrating not to be involved in the cup matches because they are always exciting games. But the advantage of coming in January was that by the time the qualifiers come round next season I will look forward to them rather than be nervous. ‘The Inter Milan game was an eye opener as to how big the support is and how noisy the ground can be. To play against a huge team like them – and for me to do so well – was a great experience and I can’t wait for next season.’ Inverness-born Armstrong played for Caley Thistle for a season as a 16-year-old before his family uprooted for Dundee and he joined up at Tannadice. While he has few ties left in the Highlands, he is full of respect for John Hughes’ side and his friend from the youth team, current Caley Thistle captain Graeme Shinnie. ‘I grew up in Nairn but I was born at Raigmore Hospital,’ he said. ‘We lived up there for six or seven years when I was young and I’ve still got family in Nairn. ‘I also played for Inverness Under 16s for a year before we moved to Dundee. The likes of Graeme Shinnie were there with the Under 19s and Terry Butcher was in charge, with Charlie Christie involved training the youth sides. ‘But I didn’t play particularly well at Inverness. I became a better player after I went to Dundee United.’","Stuart Armstrong is hoping he can win his first Premiership title .

"Kyle Naughton has been ruled out for the rest of the season after David Meyler’s red card challenge on Saturday.

Rangel said: ‘It’s not good because Kyle has an injury and I don’t wish bad on anyone, but from my point of view I always try and be ready so if the manager needs me I’ll try my best.’ Naughton will miss the rest of the season and had to helped off the pitch by the Swansea team physios .

"Glasgow Warriors have confirmed that experienced duo Al Kellock and Dougie Hall will both start Friday night's Guinness PRO12 match with Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun. Both skipper Kellock and Hall - who have played nearly 300 matches between them for the club - are to retire come the end of May and each have a maximum of six outings left of their distinguished professional careers. And while Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend was naming his full squad for the Blues match on Thursday, he announced that the second-row and hooker would start in the pack against the Welsh outfit. Glasgow Warriors veteran Al Kellock will start at lock against Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun on Friday night . The encounter is being billed as a tribute to them both and, in a nice touch by the club, the match ball will be presented by Kellock's dad and Hall's mum along with Alistair Johnson, who was Kellock's best man, and Bernie Mitchell, who was an inspirational figure for Hall coming through at Hillhead/Jordanhill. Having been a pro player for 13 years and earned 42 Scotland caps, Hall admits it will be a strange feeling hanging up his boots for good at the end of the current campaign. 'You get to a point where you start thinking to yourself 'this could be the last game of rugby I ever play' so you want to make the most of it,' the 34-year-old said. 'I really want to enjoy these last few games, but also stay focused and help the Warriors secure a play-off place and hopefully the trophy. Glasgow hooker Dougie Hall is hanging up his boots after 13 years of professional rugby . As retirement draws closer you do start to think more about the things that you love about the game. You start to think about your last team huddle, the last time you will walk out onto the pitch with your team mates and it is those moments that I will miss incredibly.' Since he first played in the equivalent of the PRO12 for Edinburgh Rugby back in 2002/03 Hall has seen the standard of all of the sides improve incredibly. As a result, despite the fact that the Warriors are first and the Blues are 10th in the table, he does not expect an easy night, far from it. 'They have a number of quality players in their side and a lot of internationals while all of the teams are getting better year on year,' he explained. 'We really have to concentrate on what we are doing ourselves and keep getting results and hopefully that takes care of things and gets us into the play-offs in the coming weeks. 'I hope that gone are the days when the PRO12 is looked on as a lesser league, the teams and the talent involved now really is top class.' Gregor Townsend's Glasgow side are currently top of the Pro12 standings ahead of Cardiff's visit . This season Hall has been restricted to seven appearances in the PRO12 for the Warriors to date, Fraser Brown and Pat MacArthur playing the majority of minutes with Kevin Bryce also pushing hard for game time in the number two jersey. And while Hall himself admits that he may not be in the gym as often as the younger trio, he feels the experience he has gained in over 140 match for the club can still help during the league run-in and in the play-offs. 'The last thing you want to do when you have played for all those years is to pick up an injury in the gym,' Hall explained. 'For me now it is all about managing myself throughout the week so that when it comes to getting out on the field I can give it everything. 'As you get older you perhaps become a bit more of a leader in the group, but I like to think I have acted like that since I came to the Warriors in 2007. Wales prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for Cardiff as the loosehead struggles with a calf strain . 'I was the starting hooker for a number of years and as Pat, and more recently, Fraser and Kevin have come in I hope they have learnt from watching what I do and also have learnt from what I say too.' Meanwhile, Cardiff Blues prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for the match with a calf strain. The injury forced the Wales and British & Irish Lions' man off last week in his side's European Rugby Challenge Cup quarter-final defeat to the Dragons. 'Gethin has got a calf strain but it is not as bad as we thought. He hasn't trained this week so is a doubt, but he is keen to play a few more games for us yet this season,' Blues attack coach Paul John said. 'We want to play to a game plan, execute well and perform to the best of our ability. To do justice to the league we have to do that. 'Glasgow are a good offloading side, they are a complete side in many ways, and we've got to control the ball better than we did last weekend.'","The Glasgow duo have played nearly 300 games between them .

"Celtic have announced that they are to erect a bronze statue of Billy McNeill to mark the magnificent achievements of the club's greatest ever captain. The statue will be positioned on the recently opened Celtic Way and will represent a man who is synonymous with the club and someone who represented them with true distinction as both a player and manager. As a player, McNeill won nine consecutive league championship titles, seven Scottish Cups, six League Cups and, of course, he was the first British team captain to lift the European Cup in 1967. Celtic legend BIlly McNeill poses with the European Cup to commemorate the club's famous 1967 victory . He was named the Scottish Footballer of the Year in season 1964-65, the first ever winner of the award. As manager, McNeill delivered four league championship titles, three Scottish Cups and he lifted the League Cup once. As both player and manager, he enjoyed a 27-year association with Celtic Football Club. Fittingly, the work on the statue will be carried out by John McKenna, the sculptor who recently completed the statue of Jock Stein which sits at the entrance to Celtic Park. Work on the statue of McNeill will begin immediately and it is hoped that the completed work will be unveiled at Celtic Park later this year, around Autumn. McNeill (right) has a shot blocked by Leeds United midfielder Paul Madeley (left) Celtic Chief Executive Peter Lawwell said: 'Growing up in the 1960s and 1970s as a Celtic supporter, Billy McNeill was an inspiration to me and someone of huge stature in the game, not only on the field but also off it, as a statesman, a leader and a figurehead for our great club. 'His achievements for Celtic are simply outstanding and across a period of 27 years he gave so much to the club. 'It is a privilege to now know Billy, and consider him as a friend. He is someone who commands the respect of everyone across the entire footballing spectrum. 'We are delighted already to have Billy as our Ambassador at the club but the Board felt unanimously that he should recognised in this way, given all that he has contributed to Celtic over so many years. 'We look forward to the unveiling of the statue, which we are sure will be a great tribute to a great man.' McNeill himself said: 'When Peter contacted me regarding the statue I was completely taken by surprise. 'Whenever I walk up the Celtic Way, I look on with a great sense of pride at the sight of Brother Walfrid, Big Jock and my old team-mate and friend Jinky rightly taking their place almost as guardians of Celtic Park. 'Every time I look back at this special club's history and what we achieved it fills me with joy, and now to be told I am to be honoured beside these Celtic greats, this really is a special day for me and all my family.' Following the 2-1 win over Inter Milan in the final, McNeill holds the European Cup above his head .","Former Celtic hero Billy McNeill will be honoured with a statue by the club .

"San Antonio stretched its streak of double-digit victories to nine with a 110-98 win against Houston on Wednesday, leaving the top three teams in the NBA's Southwest Division separated by just half a game as the regular season enters its last week. The defending champion Spurs moved onto the tail of Houston and also Memphis, which drew level with the Rockets atop the division by inflicting New Orleans' heaviest defeat of the season. In the Eastern Conference, No 1 playoff seed Atlanta had a narrow win over a Brooklyn team that still has its postseason hopes in the balance, and Cleveland secured both the Central Division title and No.2 seed in the conference by defeating Milwaukee. San Antonio guard Tony Parker lays up as the Spurs overcame the Houston Rockets 110-98 on Wednesday . Spurs win leaves the NBA's Southwest Division split by half a game as they trail Memphis and Houston .

Jason Terry led Houston with 22 points, while the Rockets got only three points from James Harden over the final three quarters. The Rockets and the Spurs meet again on Friday in a game that will be a key to determining the Southwest title. Memphis pulled even with Houston by routing New Orleans 110-74.

Brooklyn Nets' Deron Williams passes around the back of Mike Muscala of Atlanta Hawks, who won 114-111 . Atlanta completed a season sweep of Brooklyn by winning 114-111 at the Nets, with Al Horford making the go-ahead basket on a dunk with 19 seconds remaining. Playing without injured All-Star Paul Millsap and further undermanned after Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha were arrested early Wednesday at the scene of a nightclub stabbing and didn't play, the Hawks recovered after blowing a 12-point, fourth-quarter lead. Horford scored 24 points and Mike Scott had 20 points for Atlanta, which won its third straight.

"John Carver is threatening changes when Newcastle face Liverpool on Monday night as he admits concerns remain over the character of his players. It is no secret United are planning a major overhaul of their squad this summer and 'personality' will rank high when it comes to identifying transfer targets. The trip to Anfield is Newcastle's first outing since losing a fifth straight Tyne-Wear derby and they have now won just twice in 2015. John Carver says his Newcastle players have a point to prove when they face Liverpool on Monday . Newcastle in training earlier this week for their game against Liverpool on Monday in the Premier League . Moussa Sissoko (left), Vurnon Anita (centre) and Massadio Haidara (right) take a break during the session . And Carver said: 'Maybe I need to change the team and hope that sparks something. 'We are going to need characters and I want to see some energy. I didn't see energy last weekend. We talked about out-working the opposition but they out-worked us again. 'So there's something not right within their DNA when it comes to a derby game. 'There's something not right within their make-up. No matter how hard you try and no matter what you try and do, it's an issue.' Carver has now seen his Newcastle team lose four in a row and fall into relegation danger . Newcastle were beaten in last weekend's Tyne/Wear derby by Jermain Defoe's stunning volley . That being the case, Carver says close-season recruitment will focus on mental attributes as much as physical. 'You've got to try and do as much homework as you can to find out about their personality,' he said. 'But with the amount of foreign players coming in now it's a tougher situation. 'I've done this in the past when I've gone to watch a player and sat with their fans. You can actually start having a conversation about them and try to find out a little bit about their character. What's he like? Does he get many red cards? Is he aggressive? Has he got a bit of a problem socially? All those little things help to build a bigger picture. 'But for now it is about finishing our season with pride and the players proving a point to themselves, because some of them are playing for their future.'","Newcastle have lost their last four Premier League games .

He had an initial dip in form after his move but has since kicked on again and has impressed Liverpool scouts in Europe and the French league this season.

Liverpool's budget and attraction will hinge on qualification for the Champions League which Brendan Rodgers admits looks slim. They remain in the frame for James Milner and Danny Ings. The English duo's contacts are set to expire at the end of the season with neither player looking likely to extend their current deals. Milner would be available for nothing should he decide to leave Manchester City, while a compensation fee would have to be agreed between Liverpool and Burnley for Ings because of his age.","Liverpool scouts have been impressed by Geoffrey Kondogbia this season .

"John Carver says his Newcastle players have a point to prove to themselves at Liverpool on Monday night. The Magpies are in danger of being sucked into what had previously seemed an unlikely relegation battle given their alarming run of form. Amid accusations of the team 'playing with their flip-flops on', United have lost four on the spin - scoring just once - and Carver admits he does not know where their next point is coming from. It is unlikely to arrive at Anfield, a venue at which they last won in 1994. They were beaten 1-0 by North-East rivals Sunderland seven days ago – a performance Carver labelled 'embarrassing' – and there was a showdown meeting at the club's training ground this week in which the head coach let his feelings be known. John Carver says his Newcastle players have a point to prove when they face Liverpool on Monday . Carver, though, is hoping that personal pride will kick in when they travel to Merseyside. 'Before they go out my message will be simple – 'You have a point to prove, but prove it for yourself, not for me, not for anybody else, but for yourself. You owe it for yourself',' he said. 'The meeting we had on Wednesday was non-negotiable. We've had meetings in the past where I like a two-way dialogue. 'But I got a few things off my chest and it was probably the first time I've been Mr Nasty. 'After the meeting we trained and there was a great response. That hurt me a little bit because I wanted to see that on Sunday. But at least I got something from them.' Carver said this week that owner Mike Ashley has promised to invest in the squad this summer and a major overhaul is expected – out-of-contract players such as Jonas Gutierrez, Ryan Taylor and Sammy Ameobi will be released, while the likes of Yoan Gouffran, Cheick Tiote, Moussa Sissoko and Papiss Cisse are also expected to move on. Newcastle in training earlier this week for their game against Liverpool on Monday in the Premier League . Moussa Sissoko (left), Vurnon Anita (centre) and Massadio Haidara (right) at a training session . However, the promise of such renovation has done little to appease fans who are organising a boycott ahead of next Sunday's visit of Spurs. Carver, in fairness, is caught in the middle of what is a toxic relationship between supporters and the club's hierarchy. And the 50-year-old admits he has been on the receiving end of criticism from fans. 'I have to accept what people say. As long as it is done the right way and in a constructive manner, I can accept that,' he said. Newcastle were beaten in last weekend's Tyne/Wear derby by Jermain Defoe's stunning volley . Carver has now seen his Newcastle team lose four in a row and fall into relegation danger . 'It would be easy to say, 'I've had enough, thanks'. I'm not going to do that and I have still got my enthusiasm. 'I can't hide from what happened on Sunday, and I won't hide from it. What I won't take is abuse, and certainly none of my family will take abuse. 'But I wanted to give this a go because I didn't want to have any regrets. I believe in my own ability and I believe if I have got the tools then I could do a good job and a successful job.'","Newcastle take on Liverpool on Monday night at Anfield .

"Gareth Bale drives an unstoppable left-footed bullet in at the far post during a routine training drill as Real Madrid train on Wednesday. It's powerful, poised and emphatic, though far from a winner at the Nou Camp, but it's all the Welshman can do for now as he returns from international duty to a less than appreciative fan base. Bale joined Cristiano Ronaldo and Co for their second day back at training as they prepared for their first match back after the devastating loss to Barcelona that saw them fall four points behind the La Liga leaders. Gareth Bale chests down a cross from the right before unleashing a bullet in Real Madrid training . Perfectly balanced, Bale cocks his powerful left leg to hit his shot on the half-volley . Having hit the ball sweetly it rockets into the net at the far post giving the keeper no chance . The under fire winger returns to Madrid on the back of a vital double for Wales against Israel as they claimed top spot in Euro 2016 qualifying's group B. Showing no signs of the drama he's been subject to in Spain, including an attack on his white Bentley by a so-called fan, Bale scored his 15th and 16th goals for his country. His first came from a curling free-kick over the wall before his second, a strong finish after arriving late into the area, marked his 20th for the season in all competitions.

Goals aside, Bale was a menace throughout the match, constantly asking questions against the side that until this match led Wales and Belgium in the group. Carlo Ancelotti and his state employed small-sided games and shooting drills to bring Real back to business as usual on Wednesday as they prepare to take on 19th-placed Granada on Sunday in an early 11am kick-off. Real have won just one of their last five games in all competitions - and was a 2-0 home victory against Levante in which Bale, the player Real fans have seemingly fallen out of love with, scored both goals.

He's done a great job since he arrived at the club and I don't understand this witch hunt against him',' he said on Neox TV's El Chiringuito. The defender had similar words for Ronaldo, who has also faced hash criticism of late. 'They've been very unfair with him. Nobody can doubt his professionalism. He has every right to think they've been unfair to him.

"Real Sociedad remain hopeful over a deal for Burnley striker Danny Ings. Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United have all shown interest in the England Under 21 international but have yet to sign him up as they consider other options also. Ings has interest from Borussia Monchengladbach among others but Sociedad have remained constant from the start. Real Sociedad are still hopeful of singing Burnley striker Danny Ings when his contract expires in the summer .

Ings' contract at Burnley expires in the summer and is unlikely to sign another one regardless of their ability to survive relegation this season. Should Ings move to another Premier League club Burnley would be due a sizeable compensation fee because of his age, but that fee would be nominal if the striker moved abroad.","Danny Ings' contract expires in the summer and is set to leave Burnley .

"Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres believes coach Diego Simeone's clear understanding of the team's weaknesses has been the key to their success as they seek revenge against Real Madrid on Tuesday for last season's Champions League final defeat. With the determined Argentine at the helm, Atletico have belied their economic inferiority to become one of the most dangerous sides in Europe and now the La Liga champions take on Real aiming once again for a place in the semi-finals of the continent's elite competition. In the past Atletico were accustomed to being swept aside by the footballing aristocrats, who claimed their 10th European crown against them in Lisbon, but now they are more than capable of trading blows. Fernando Torres (centre) scored his first ever league own goal during the 2-2 draw with Malaga on Saturday . Torres has praised the coaching style of Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone (centre) In fact since that final, when Atletico were agonisingly close to a victory before a Sergio Ramos header forced extra-time and then Real ran away with the match, Simeone's side has had the upper hand in the Madrid clashes. Atletico beat Real to win the season's Super Cup curtain-raiser, knocked them out of the King's Cup and defeated them in both La Liga clashes. The manner of their 4-0 demolition of Real in February's league meeting even led to questions about the future of coach Carlo Ancelotti. 'It is his character as a player and his character as a coach that drives the team,' Torres told UEFA.com of Simeone.

'He knows we are a team that needs to know what we are about, our weaknesses and our strengths, but above all our weaknesses so we can then implement our qualities. 'We don't have the options that Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern (Munich) or Chelsea have, we cannot drop points and make up for them later. We are a team that plays at our limit.' The pressure is very much on Ancelotti going into the game with Real having surrendered their La Liga lead and dropping two points behind Barcelona.

"In the aftermath of Sunday's derby disaster the talk among fans was of summer incomings to reboot a blue machine that, all-of-a-sudden, looks as outdated as a Commodore 64. Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by United at Old Trafford . The afternoon started so well for Aguero and City when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes . Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for Manchester City with David Silva as De Gea looks dejected . It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain £38m for in 2011. Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration . The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012 . Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title . Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. Wilfried Bony has only scored once in five appearances since joining City from Swansea in January . City's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer . Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is a potential target as the City owner prepares to open the cheque book . The former Swansea City man, who cost just £10m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling could also be on any list of summer targets . Manuel Pellegrini is facing the sack even if Manchester City qualify for the Champions League . There are others to ponder. Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Are they at fault for spending the best part of £200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can? With Financial Fair Play sanctions hurting, it was essential that City got bang for the buck. In reality they barely had a whimper. The pile on the in-tray on chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak's desk seems to be getting taller every week. It is essential that keeping Aguero is top of that ever-growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash.","Manchester City were beaten 4-2 by Manchester United at Old Trafford .

"Old-stager Jamie Peacock scored a try double as Leeds claimed a  20th successive victory over Salford. The 37-year-old Rhinos prop had not scored a try for almost 12 months but went over twice in the first half to help the Super League table toppers to their fifth win in a row. Salford's last home win against the Rhinos was a 21-12 Regal Trophy victory at The Willows in November 1993 and their wait goes on after a 28-18 loss. But their depleted side turned in a battling show, trailing 16-12 at half-time, before slipping to only their second defeat in the last eight games. Jamie Peacock broke his try drought with a double for Leeds in their win over Salford on Sunday . Full-back Niall Evalds followed up his two-try show against Wigan with another brace with the Red Devils other touchdown from Lama Tasi. Peacock crossed for his side's first two tries before Ash Handley, the outstanding Rob Burrow and Zak Hardaker went in to seal a hard-fought win in difficult conditions. Salford, already without the suspended Rangi Chase and Weller Hauraki, were shorn of another six regulars but coach Iestyn Harris was not taking the voluntary option to rest any of his players before Saturday's cup tie at Leigh. His hand was forced with Tommy Lee, Kevin Locke, Josh Griffin, Cory Paterson and brothers Jordan and Adam Walne all injured. Harris handed debuts to Under-19 captain Ryan Lannon - cousin of Gareth Hock - and 20-year-old Matty Gee with the back-row pair starting in the bench. Apart from injured wingers Tom Briscoe and Ryan Hall, the Rhinos were also missing Kallum Watkins against the club where he started as a junior, Jamie Jones-Buchanan and Kylie Leuluai. Kevin Sinfield used the strong wind to his advantage from the start with his kick off blowing back to give his side possession. But handling errors by Peacock and Handley gave Salford confidence although Leeds had the first chance to go ahead after 16 minutes. Ben Jones-Bishop spilled a pass in the wind with Danny McGuire pouncing on the loose ball 40 metres out but was hauled down by Theo Fages. The Rhinos did manage to go in front after 22 minutes when Peacock charged over from close range after Salford conceded back-to-back penalties with Sinfield tagging on the conversion. But the Red Devils hit back immediately with Fages' side-stepping run sending sub Tasi over with Michael Dobson's kick levelling the scores. Then Evalds shot through the Leeds defence to fire Salford into a 12-6 lead. Peacock struck again to level at 12-12 after being the quickest to react to McGuire's grubber kick. Salford thought they had regained the advantage four minutes before the break when Hardaker failed to gather Dobson's towering kick in the gale and Scott Taylor collected the ball to race over. But referee Matt Thomason ruled Taylor was offside before he was forced to hold up play when an advertising hoarding blew onto the pitch. The wind then came to the Rhinos aid with kicks by Liam Sutcliffe and Stevie Ward held back by the conditions for Handley to cross in the corner and make it 16-12 at half-time. Handley looked suspiciously offside for his try and it had been a valiant effort by the Red Devils before the break. Leeds have themselves some breathing space early in the second half with Joel Moon slipping two tackles against his old club for the supporting Burrow to scamper over and stretch the lead to 22-12. Salford refused to concede defeat and cut the gap back to four points when Evalds out jumped Handley for his second try from a well judged Dobson kick after 57 minutes. But Salford's elation was short lived when Burrow's burst set up the chance for Hardaker to scythe past Tasi and make it 28-18 on the hour and wrap things up.","Jamie Peacock scored two tries for Leeds in their win over Salford .

"Conor O’Shea has revealed his concern at the increasing force of rugby’s collisions after Harlequins and England full back Mike Brown was consigned to even more time on the sidelines to recover from the latest high-profile head injury. Brown has not played since the final round of the RBS 6 Nations on March 21, is still suffering headaches after a week-long holiday in Dubai and no closer to being declared symptom-free. The episode raises questions about whether the 29-year-old was brought back too early for England’s title-decider against France, having been knocked out in the Test against Italy five weeks earlier following a crunching collision with Andrea Masi. Mike Brown is knocked out in a collision with Italy’s Andrea Masi in the Six Nations last month . Brown was out cold for approximately eight minutes and hasn't played since the Italy game on March 21st . ‘It’s a concern because I don’t like someone coming in with something you can’t diagnose,’ said O’Shea, Quins’ director of rugby. ‘Sometimes a physio will sit you down and say, “It’s six to 12 weeks out”. Here it could be tomorrow or it could be whenever — we don’t have a timescale. There’s no doubt that a decade or even a year ago Browny would be back out on the pitch. ‘You want to see the gladiatorial side of things — the big hits that we’ve all grown up with. It was once a badge of honour that you got up and got on with it. But at least we’re now aware. Is it a concern for the game that we’re seeing collisions of the nature that we are? Yes, it has to be.’ Brown will have played just six of his club’s last 19 games after sitting out of the coming weekend, and his England team-mates Joe Marler and Chris Robshaw have featured in only eight of the last 18. Northampton have ruled out George North, who is suffering from his own concussion problems after being knocked out in three different collisions, until the end of the month and O’Shea must also deal with the absence of one of his marquee players. George North suffered his third concussion in four months during Northampton's defeat to Wasps . ‘You can look at a succession of events for George North, whereas this is a follow-on of symptoms from one event,’ said O’Shea. ‘Against Italy it was as big a hit as I’ve seen someone take. It was quite frankly a monstrous hit. I was pretty worried when I saw it live. ‘Is it tough on us having the England full back for six out of 19 games and still indeterminate? Yes, but there are more important things than rugby.’","Brown was consigned to even more time on the sidelines to recover from the latest high-profile head injury .

"Juan Mata described Manchester United's 4-2 derby victory as a 'massive win' as they opened up a four-point gap on Manchester City. United had lost their last four meetings with City but goals from Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Mata and Chris Smalling gave the Red Devils their biggest derby win for six years. Sergio Aguero opened the scoring and also netted late on for his 100th City goal but United were by far the better team to tighten their grip on third spot in the Barclays Premier League. Old Trafford roars with Marouane Fellaini after the influential Belgian gave the Red Devils the lead . Wayne Rooney leaps onto Fellaini's back after United take the lead at Old Trafford in the Manchester derby . 'The first 10 or 15 minutes they were brilliant and played well but after that the team showed character and we came back,' Mata told Sky Sports 1. 'It's a massive win for us, it's a great result and everyone at United is happy. 'The atmosphere was crazy, it is something we will never forget. Juan Mata, released by Rooney, scores as Manchester United smash their rivals at Old Trafford . 'You could tell how important it was for the fans but we still have six games to go and we have to keep going. 'It's a big win and a boost of confidence but Arsenal are doing great and I'm sure City and Liverpool will fight to the end, so we have to fight to the last minute.' Young equalised Aguero's early strike and then set up Fellaini to give United a first-half lead. All of United's outfield players congratulate Chris Smalling after his close-range header ensured victory . 'We were disappointed to go a goal behind but we showed that team spirit to get back in the game and no other team was going to win it when we went ahead,' Young told Sky Sports 1. 'It was an amazing feeling to score. I was delighted to put the ball in the net and get an assist as well but the important thing was we showed that character to win the game. 'It was a magnificent win. We knew it was going to be a tough game but we knew we had to get the three points.'

"Diego Costa has identified Chelsea's crunch clash against Arsenal for his latest hamstring injury comeback. The Spain international limped off just 11 minutes after coming on as a substitute in Chelsea's 2-1 win over Stoke on Saturday. Costa has been told he will miss just over two weeks following his latest hamstring setback, a problem that has dogged him all season. Diego Costa is unlikely to miss the entirety of Chelsea's title run-in and could return within two weeks . Costa limped off just 11 minutes into his return from injury in Chelsea's 2-1 win over Stoke City on Saturday . Costa is likely to be fit to face Arsenal in what could prove a key game in Chelsea's title run-in . The striker will not do any ball work at the club's Cobham HQ this week, instead focusing on strength sessions and intensive massages on the injured muscle. Costa is also expected to see a specialist before he is given the green light to step up his rehabilitation regime. The striker will definitely miss the games against Queens Park Rangers and Manchester United. But the league leaders face second placed Arsenal, in a clash that could prove pivotal in the title race on April 26 and Costa is said to be determined to play. Chelsea's trip to the Emirates Stadium is the most likely date for Costa to return to Jose Mourinho's side . Costa has pulled out of a planned in-store appearance at Chelsea's club shop on Wednesday . But Jose Mourinho will not take any unnecessary risks with his star striker and could decide against fielding Costa against the Gunners if the title is virtually sewn up by then. Depending on how the title race develops, the the club are considering giving Costa an extended break between now and the end of the season to help him overcome his hamstring problems. Mourinho is determined to avoid the need for surgery and may decide to use the striker sparingly for the run-in depending on how close the title race pans out. The Chelsea striker had been subbed off against Hull City before the international break with a similar injury . Mourinho will be delighted by the news that his top scorer could be back soon, although he will miss him .

"If Manuel Pellegrini leaves the Barclays Premier League at the end of this season — and it is by no means certain — then he will leave behind barely a trace. Inside Manchester City, the Chilean has always provided a welcome contrast to the emotional stresses of life epitomised by his predecessor Roberto Mancini but — on the field and across the landscape of English football — Pellegrini has made the shallowest of footprints. Progress at the Etihad Stadium has in recent years been slight. Indeed, you could say there has been none, particularly in relation to money spent. At City, however, the fact is that the identity of the manager represents only a small part of the problem. Manuel Pellegrini could be out of a job in the summer, and if he is, he will have left little behind . Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has fallen well short of the standards he set in recent seasons . Pellegrini leaves the stadium as Manchester City suffered their fifth defeat in seven matches . As reported in Sportsmail after City’s defeat in Barcelona last month, there is no particular desire at the club to sack Pellegrini. More poor results, more points separating his team from champions-elect Chelsea may cause the ground to shift a little further but any decision regarding the manager will be motivated much more by what happens next rather than what happened over the past eight months. Certainly, this has been a lamentable defence of the title, as bad as when conceding it by 11 points in 2013. At the Etihad there is, however, a recognition that problems are not all down to the manager. There are some issues with Pellegrini. Some City players think he is too nice — a soft touch who does not inspire with words or his substitutions and who displays a fondness for a 4-4-2 formation that they feel leaves them vulnerable. Pellegrini has not alienated or even polarised his dressing room, however. The majority are happy to work and play for him. The more significant problem is that City’s squad, constructed carefully and expensively, is too old, too foreign and has not been improved by recent transfers. James Milner is one of very few Englishmen in a first team squad that is too foreign and too old . Manchester City signed defender Eliaquim Mangala for £32million last summer and he has been poor . Wilfried Bony was signed in January from Swansea for £28m but has only scored once since arriving . City have had a very good team for quite a while now. Signing David Silva and Yaya Toure in 2010 and Sergio Aguero a year later lifted them to their current level but nothing since the first Premier League title has hinted at the further progress many presumed would be inevitable. Recruitment has, on the whole, been poor, thus allowing established players to coast, perhaps subconsciously, without the pressure of in-house competition. Football director Txiki Begiristain has been largely responsible for this and his contribution, at least that which we can see, has been disappointing given the reputation earned at Barcelona. At all clubs, teams and players must move forward to thrive but too many at City have stagnated. Vincent Kompany, for example, no longer seems capable of looking after his own performances, never mind that of his team. For a club captain, his popularity in the City dressing room is limited. Elsewhere, players such as Samir Nasri contributed when City were playing well but disappeared once things became harder. Since hacking at Neymar during the Barcelona defeat, an act that earned him the cheapest of yellow cards, the France international has played only 13 minutes of two games. It is understood that the two things are not unrelated. Nasri is just one who may fret a little about his future this summer. Txiki Begiristain (left) has failed to live up to his reputation, and Manchester City's recruitment has been poor . Stevan Jovetic, a £22m signing from Fiorentina, could find himself shipped out as City try to deal with FFP . Samir Nasri gives a thumbs up despite City's defeat at Crystal Palace, and the Frenchman's poor form . Wary of Financial Fair Play restrictions, City cannot spend enormous sums on targets such as Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba without first selling. Others who are vulnerable include Stevan Jovetic, Bacary Sagna and even Toure. The Toure debate is not new but what should be kept in mind is that the Ivorian will not be going anywhere until someone matches a salary that exceeds £1million a month. It could be that City’s climb back to the very top will be slow. They will need to be shrewder in the market and hope investment in their academy pays off. Better decisions are required from top to bottom. As for Pellegrini, he would be daft to think he is not vulnerable and a late-season surge would help him. Odd as it sounds, however, the identity of the manager is currently not City’s biggest issue.","Manchester City have made little progress since Manuel Pellegrini arrived .
Despite last year's title win, City have again failed miserably to retain it .

"The view that Manchester City’s chance at defending their Premier League title has been ruined through bad spending gathered pace after they were defeated by a club whose entire team cost less than half one of their substitutes. Crystal Palace’s XI on Monday night may only have been worth a mere £17m, but left back Martin Kelly still made it through a City defence deemed good enough to keep £40m signing Eliaquim Mangala on the bench to tee up a chance for Wilfried Zaha just 60 seconds into the game. Mangala joined from Porto in August last year and is contracted to City until June 2019. Eliaquim Mangala (green bib) prepares to come on but he never made it off the Manchester City bench . However, striker Glenn Murray succeeded in putting another dent in City’s chances of redeeming themselves after a run of four losses away, when he scored Palace’s first goal. Murray cost Palace nothing when joined from arch rivals Brighton in 2011. Jason Puncheon, signed for a comparative pittance of £1.9m, delivered City their final blow with a goal from a finely executed free-kick. Glenn Murray (left) cost Palace nothing four years ago yet found a way past the City defence . Another expensive City player, £24m-man Yaya Toure, got his team back in the game with 12 minutes left, but they couldn’t penetrate Palace’s defence to find an equaliser and a 2-1 defeat leaves them nine points adrift of the top. Toure joined from Barcelona in July 2010 and is contracted to City until 2017. After spending a total of £500m pounds on transfer fees, City might have expected to be higher than a precarious fourth in the league, but judging by their latest results, it’s teams like Crystal Palace that seem to be getting their value for money. Mangala has endured a miserable first season at the Etihad Stadium since his £40million move .","Manchester City beaten 2-1 by Crystal Palace on Easter Monday .

"Everton defender John Stones was the shock name on Barcelona’s shopping list of central defenders last summer. Barcelona ended up signing 31-year-old Jeremy Mathieu from Valencia for £14.5m and 29-year-old Thomas Vermaelen from Arsenal for £15m but influential voices at the Catalan club urged then sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta to bid for 20-year-old Stones instead. According to El Pais, Barcelona were desperate for defensive reinforcements at the end of last season. The former Barnsley defender  moved himself up the list of possible targets with performances for Everton that saw the youngster on the stand-by list for England’s World Cup campaign in Brazil. Everton defender John Stones was on Barcelona's list of defensive transfer targets last summer . Barcelona were desperate for reinforcements and Stones' performances  caught the eye of the Catalans . His ability to play at right-back as well as centre-back played in his favour with the club preparing for the likely departure of Dani Alves currently in the final year of his contract and Barcelona's preference for central defenders with the mobility and technique to play at full-back. In the end Barcelona coach Luis Enrique insisted on the signing of Mathieu – another who can also fill-in at full-back - and Stones signed a new £30,000-a-week five-year deal keeping him at Everton until 2019. The contract was seen as a rebuff to Chelsea who were following Stones but it now also seems to have been in response to interest from La Liga leaders Barcelona. Stones signed a new £30,000-a-week five year deal keeping him at Everton until 2019 . French defender Mathieu has been a success at the Camp Nou but Vermaelen is yet to start a game for Barcelona. The Belgian arrived with a hamstring injury sustained at the World Cup and never played more than a friendly against an Indonesian XI before having an operation in Finland in December to remedy the problem. He is now training with team-mates but still some way off match fitness and while he could be available for the last month of the season Barcelona have no margin of error in the league and he may have to wait until next season to make his first start. With Vermaelen struggling to regain fitness and both Mathieu and Javier Mascherano having reached 30, Barcelona – who cannot sign anyone until January 2016 because of a Fifa ban – have not forgotten about Stones, who turns 21 at the end of May.

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez has rejected accusations stubbornness prevents him from adapting his tactical approach. The Spaniard has come in for criticism for persisting with trying to get his side to play out from the back despite results suffering recently. There were even suggestions the players had gone to him asking to play a more direct style but Martinez has always stuck rigidly to his principles, which was the case when he was at Wigan when they were in relegation battles every season.

Everton striker Arouna Kone (right) is tackled by Southampton defender Jose Fonte (left) at Goodison Park . Everton left-back Leighton Baines comes in with a strong challenge on Southampton forward Shane Long . But while he may persist in wanting to play the same way he said that does not mean his tactics are rigid. 'The people who say that I am tactically not flexible are people who do not follow my work,' Martinez told the Liverpool Echo. 'I have been innovative at every football club I have been at with my tactics, my shape and my approach. 'I am not someone who needs to defend myself but if you follow my work then I am probably one of the most flexible managers tactically that you could work with.' Martinez tinkered with the shape of his side in Saturday's victory over Southampton, their third successive league win, as he switched to a 4-1-4-1 formation with Gareth Barry the solitary holding midfielder with his regular central partner James McCarthy pushed further forward. He explained he made the change to compensate for the absence of leading scorer Romelu Lukaku, who is still recovering from a hamstring injury. 'It was because we didn't have Romelu,' he added. 'In certain games we played with two strikers. On Saturday we had Aaron Lennon really high up the pitch and James McCarthy had freedom. 'Every game is different. Southampton have a very strong back six that needs to be broken in different ways. 'We don't play the same way twice, but it is not for me to go openly and publicly and tell everyone what we have done.' Martinez insists that his tactics are 'innovative' and points to his changes made against Southampton . Having started the season poorly, Everton are now up to 11th in the Premier League table with 37 points .","Roberto Martinez has hit out at suggestions that he is tactically stubborn .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez insists he is not worried that Romelu Lukaku’s new agent will destabilise the player — even though incendiary comments last week look like they were made with that intention. Lukaku was absent injured as Phil Jagielka’s goal settled this match to give Everton a third straight victory. But the win came in the wake of Lukaku’s new agent Mino Raiola saying Lukaku would never have signed for Everton had he been his representative earlier. ‘Later on, he’ll play for one of world’s best teams: PSG, Manchester City, Manchester United or Bayern Munich,’ Raiola said, sparking uncertainty over the future of the 21-year-old Belgian, who became Everton’s record signing when moving from Chelsea for £28million last summer. Romelu Lukaku (left) has had some big claims made about him by his new agent Mino Raiola (right) Roberto Martinez has dismissed claims suggesting his star striker could leave Goodison Park . Southampton have scored just five goals in nine games since the start of February (0.55 per game). This is less than a third the rate before that (1.68 per game). ‘In the modern game you don’t get the values of 25 years ago,’ said Martinez, implying a decline in standards of behaviour by agents. ‘But when you have a player on a long-term contract there is nothing to discuss. That is straightforward and clear.’ Lukaku signed a five-year contract at Goodison so will have four years remaining after this summer. ‘My focus is that Rom keeps on developing,’ Martinez said. ‘Without a doubt we have been the best club for him because he has had his two best seasons that he has had as a professional and we love Romelu. Agent Raiola said he would have never sanctioned Lukaku’s £28million move to Goodison Park . Raiola hinted that Everton are just a stepping stone for Lukaku on his route to the very top . ‘It has been a joy to see him developing, there is going to be a lot of talk when you score goals as a striker, you are going to get the attraction of other teams … If an agent is going to make those comments, then it is normal that you are going to ask about it. An agent can say whatever they want and it is down to everyone else to see what is behind it.’ Martinez’s counterpart, Ronald Koeman, admitted Saints’s chances of Champions League football next season were all but extinguished by this defeat. ‘It’s not realistic [now] to finish in the top four,’ he said.’","Romelu Lukaku's agent Mino Raiola said his client would leave for big club .

"Harry Kane's participation with England at this summer's Under 21 European Championship remains in  doubt after Tottenham confirmed they will travel to Malaysia for a post-season friendly. Spurs announced on Tuesday morning they will visit Kuala Lumpur next month to take on a Malaysia XI in the AIA Cup. The match will take place at the Shah Alam Stadium on Wednesday, May 27 - before Tottenham  take on Sydney FC the following Saturday - and Kane has been told he will be part of the travelling party for the two exhibition games. Harry Kane could miss the Under 21 European Championship due to Tottenham playing a friendly in Malaysia . Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino has expressed fears about burnout for the 21-year-old striker with the FA in talks with Tottenham officials about Kane playing for the Under 21 side in the Czech Republic at this summer's tournament. Kane is keen to play in Gareth Southgate's side at the championship, which runs from June 17-30, but Pochettino wants the forward to miss the tournament in order to have enough recovery time ahead of next season. The young Tottenham forward, who captained his side during Sunday's 0-0 draw with Burnley, has been told he will not be required for the senior friendly against the Republic of Ireland on June 7 or the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia a week later. Kane scored just 79 seconds into his England debut after coming off the bench to head home during last month's 4-0 win over Lithuania at Wembley.

"Everton midfielder James McCarthy believes Ross Barkley is more than capable of handling the highs and lows which accompany the tremendous expectation which rests on his shoulders. The 1-0 victory over Southampton, courtesy of captain Phil Jagielka's fifth goal of the season, was a case in point. In the first half he produced a brilliant piece of control and skill to skip past three opponents and launch an attack from deep inside his own half which brought Goodison Park to its feet. Everton midfielder James McCarthy believes Ross Barkley is capable of handling the pressure on him . McCarthy (left) said he thought Barkley was 'different class' despite a mistake with an ambitious pass . However, when his ambitious pass after the break gifted possession to the visitors the all-too familiar sound of loud groans echoed around the ground. Then, to cap it all, manager Roberto Martinez's decision to replace him with 20 minutes to go - a requirement to help shore up a tight game - was greeted with disagreement and boos. It is difficult to know what Barkley, who was lauded for two substitute appearances for England in the last 10 days, thought of it, but McCarthy is confident the youngster can deal with the complexities and confusion which appear to surround most of his performances. 'I think Ross was different class,' he said. 'I thought he worked really hard for the team and was a real nuisance driving at people and it was brilliant to see him high in confidence having been away with England. Barkley was withdrawn with 20 minutes to go at Goodison Park, a decision that brought boos from the crowd . 'Ross is a good lad and has his feet firmly on the ground and has a lot of people at the club looking after him. 'He won't get carried away. We have a lot of characters, a lot of experienced heads in the dressing room and there is no better place to be for him.' Aside from Jagielka's 16th-minute goal, giving the centre-back his best tally in eight years at the club, the only other notable action saw goalkeeper Tim Howard claw away Graziano Pelle's early shot from under his crossbar and throw out a hand, while diving the wrong way, to stop James Ward-Prowse's strike. Everton achieved what they were unable to do earlier in the season and ground out victory to make it three successive wins, moving them to 11th in the table, with the relegation fears of a couple of weeks ago now a thing of the past. With nothing to play for in their remaining seven matches McCarthy believes the motivation is to remain unbeaten until the end of the campaign. McCarthy is confident youngster Barkley can deal with the complexities of his sometimes indifferent form . 'We want to kick on, go on a winning run and finish the season strongly,' he added. 'We have won three games and we want to go unbeaten until the end of the season, although that is easier said than done. 'There has been a big improvement. So far, so good, but we won't get carried away. 'The most important thing was to get three points and dig in deep to secure it with a clean sheet.' With leading scorer Romelu Lukaku not quite ready to return after a hamstring injury, the onus was on other players to step up, but few would have bet on Jagielka being the match winner against Saints. Everton secured a 1-0 victory over Southampton, courtesy of captain Phil Jagielka's fifth goal of the season . 'He is different class. He is brilliant to have at the club and is a true leader on the pitch,' said McCarthy. 'A lot of people have been saying the last few weeks he has been exceptional, but for me he has been outstanding throughout the campaign and he is chipping in with goals.' Southampton boss Ronald Koeman conceded his side's Champions League hopes were now over, but was still keen to secure European football next season. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman conceded his side's Champions League hopes were now over . 'European football for the club will be a great success if we reach it,' he said. 'If we showed the ambition we showed (against Everton) then we will have a good chance.' Italy international Pelle has not scored in nine matches for his club - he did manage one against England in midweek - but Koeman still backs him. 'Pelle is struggling but that is football, it is normal. If I don't have confidence I don't pick him in the line-up,' he added.","Everton beat Southamton 1-0 at Goodison Park on Saturday afternoon .

"Jack Nicklaus recorded his first ever hole-in-one at the Masters on Wednesday, as Camilo Villegas fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par-three contest. Villegas holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside Kevin Streelman on five under par, only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play-off hole. Kevin Streelman holds his trophy aloft after winning the Par-3 Contest on a play-off against Camilo Villegas . Streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the 'curse' of the par-three champion, with no player ever becoming par-three and Masters champion in the same year. However, that was placed firmly into perspective thanks to his 11-year-old caddie Ethan Couch, who has a benign but inoperable brain tumour. Streelman found Couch via the Make-a-Wish Foundation and invited him to be his caddie in the light-hearted curtain-raiser. Augusta National's par-three course traditionally hosts the contest the day before start of the major . 'It was a really fun day, especially to have Ethan with me here,' Streelman said. 'This isn't about me today. It's about helping him out and showing him a great day.' Villegas said: 'I've made a few hole-in-ones, but it's pretty special to make them here. The second one, we were a little more emotional there. We just kind of jumped.' Nicklaus had earlier holed out with an eight iron from 123 yards on the fourth, his ball landing around 15 feet past the pin and spinning back into the hole. Woods played in the Masters par-three contest at Augusta National for the first time in 11 years . That took the 75-year-old six-time champion to three under par, but he would bogey the fifth and hit two balls into the water on the ninth to end his hopes of an unlikely triumph. Former US Open champion Curtis Strange reminded Nicklaus of the tradition that players who make a hole-in-one have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse when Nicklaus walked past the ESPN commentary position. 'Send me a bill,' Nicklaus replied. The Masters official Twitter account shared an image of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods with Niall Horan . The 18-time major winner added on ESPN: 'I never had a hole in one at Augusta, in the par three (contest) or on the golf course. Doing an interview this morning I said all I have to do is go out there, make a hole-in-one and win the par three. I had it three under and then choked.' Since the contest started in 1960, nobody has ever become par-three and Masters champion in the same week, a fact which sometimes sees players deliberately not shoot the best score possible. Most treat it as light relief and invite family or friends to act as their caddies, including Tiger Woods this year for the first time since 2004. Woods had his children Charlie and Sam on his bag and made sure he could not win the event by getting daughter Sam to tap in for par on the sixth. Jack Nicklaus (centre) with Ben Crenshaw (left) and Gary Player (right) during the Par-3 Contest . 'We had an absolutely great time. These were memories for a lifetime,' said Woods, who was also accompanied by girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. He later added on Twitter: 'I'll always have memories of my pop at Augusta and now Sam & Charlie. An amazing day.' Tournament favourite Rory McIlroy had One Direction singer Niall Horan acting as his caddie and Horan proved he should stick to singing after badly hooking a tee shot on the ninth into the water. 'I apologise to golf,' Horan joked. 'I do perform to a lot of people but we were performing to their parents today! There was a lot of pressure.' McIlroy, who is looking to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam by winning a first Masters title on Sunday, added: 'I wanted to do this because it's a big week for me and just to go into the tournament in a relaxed mood. To spend a couple of hours like this was fun.'","Kevin Streelman beat Camilo Villegas on third play-off hole at Augusta .

"He was once the most fearsome competitor in all of sport, infamous for his prickly nature towards rivals and single-minded pursuit of victory. But the Tiger Woods who has turned up to Augusta National this year is different. Very different. Earlier this week we were treated to the sight of Woods embracing Darren Clarke on the practice ground. Europe's Ryder Cup captain is an old pal of Tiger's so that was unusual, but understandable. So too was the sight of him sharing a hearty laugh with his old mucker, Mark O'Meara. But dancing? Yes, Tiger Woods dancing. Forget unusual, that is almost alarming. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO OF TIGER WOODS DANCING WHILE PRACTISING . Tiger Woods was spotted dancing while he practised on Monday at Augusta National . The former world No 1 had headphones in both ears as he listened to music while honing his game . A video has emerged of the former world No 1, with headphones in each ear, bopping away while he honed his wedge game on the practice ground on Monday. No prizes for the first person to ask: 'was he listening to Tiger Feet?' Augusta's patrons were treated to another glimpse of the new, cuddly Tiger on Wednesday morning as he enjoyed another manly hug with veteran Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez. Woods shared a warm greeting with Miguel Angel Jimenez on Wednesday morning . The 14-time major champion embraced the veteran Spaniard on the practice ground at Augusta . Jimenez watches on as Woods hits a drive during the build-up to the Masters . Perhaps the 50-year-old was offering Woods some tips on how to play the course, having finished fourth last year. Woods may be a four-time Masters champion but he has not played competitively since the first week in February and has battled through a bout of the chipping yips. Maybe the tunes have helped to release some of the tension in his short game. Woods will also play in the traditional Masters warm-up, the Par-3 Contest, for the first time in 11 years on Wednesday. The 39-year-old will be joined by his daughter, Sam, 7, and his son, Charlie, 6, for the event, which is a light-hearted affair for the players and their families. Woods and former champion Ben Crenshaw compare putters on the 13th green during a practice round . Woods is watched by his coach, Chris Como, as he hits on the driving range on Wednesday . Meanwhile, Australia's Marc Leishman has withdrawn from the Masters due to personal reasons. Leishman's wife Audrey was taken ill with an apparent case of pneumonia last week and put into an induced coma in hospital. 'It is with both deep regret and incredible relief I am withdrawing from the Masters tournament this week,' Leishman said in a statement. 'My wife Audrey has survived a life threatening medical emergency and I have decided to remain by her side with our children. 'Thanks to an incredible team of doctors and nurses Audrey appears to be on the road to a full recovery. Our two young children remain blessed to have the world's best mum in their lives. I want to pass along our thanks to all who supported us through this difficult period. 'We ask that you keep Audrey in your thoughts and prayers and I wish my best to all of the competitors for a great 2015 Masters.' Leishman finished joint fourth at Augusta when fellow Australian Adam Scott won the Masters in 2013. He had been due to tee off at 4:03pm BST on Thursday alongside former champion Ian Woosnam and Erik Compton. His withdrawal brings the field down to 97 players.","Tiger Woods put on another show of affection at Augusta National .

"Masters Wednesday began on a sombre note when Australian Marc Leishman, who got so close to victory in 2013 before finishing tied fourth behind countryman Adam Scott, had to withdraw.

I don’t think we would ever host another one.’ Billy Payne has ruled out starting a women's Masters despite talking about growing the game . It’s well-known the garish surroundings outside Augusta National contrast markedly with the beauty within. But maybe that’s about to change. After buying up all the houses on adjacent Berckmans Road and turning it into a patrons’ car park, Masters chairman Billy Payne is promising a ‘beautification’ project. ‘As you know, we’re pretty good at landscaping,’ he said. ‘It’s going to look nice, I promise.’ Mr Unpopular Bubba Watson can surely not have upset anyone with his choice of menu for the Champions Dinner on Tuesday. Clearly he enjoyed it so much two years ago he decided to stick with the same inoffensive offering: Caesar salad followed by grilled chicken breast with green beans, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese and cornbread. Bubba Watson was recently voted the most unpopular golfer on tour by his fellow professionals . Favourite pic of the week so far?

"It's that time of the season when Premier League footballers cast their vote for the PFA Players’ Player of the Year. Last year’s winner Luis Suarez now resides in Spain, so, too, does 2013 victor Gareth Bale. It means we’re almost certain to see a new name on the trophy come May. Here, Sportsmail runs you through the six leading contenders… . Name: Harry Kane . Club: Tottenham . Age: 21 . Stats: Apps 44, Goals 29 . Striker Harry Kane has hit an astonishing 29 goals in 44 games for Tottenham so far this season . Kane (second right) has twice been named Player of the Month during his breakthrough campaign . Kane (left) broke into the England squad and scored 79 seconds into his debut against Lithuania . Reasons he deserves it: Very few would have predicted Kane would plunder an incredible 29 goals by early April in what is essentially his breakthrough season. His has been the name on everyone’s lips since the turn of the year and last month’s England call-up was thoroughly deserved. In an age where diving, spitting, lying and cheating too often dominate our news agenda, Kane’s goal-laden arrival has been a joy to witness. Reasons he doesn’t: Are there any? You could argue it took him until November to score two Premier League goals but that was as much to do with a lack of opportunities. Previous (individual) Premier League honours: Player of the Month (2) Name: Eden Hazard . Club: Chelsea . Age: 24 . Stats: Apps 44, Goals 17 . Eden Hazard has been Chelsea's outstanding performer, scoring 17 times in 44 games . Hazard (left) has been a menace to opponents all season with his trickery and high workrate . Hazard (centre) is the odds-on favourite to be named PFA Players' Player of the Year . Reasons he deserves it: He’s running back into form at just the right time and his goals look like they’ll edge Chelsea towards the title. Hazard, under the instruction of Jose Mourinho, has married graft to his craft and has been his side’s outstanding player this season. The fact he works so hard in addition to his creativity is sure to earn the respect of fellow pros and it’s no surprise he is the odds-on favourite for the prize. Reasons he doesn’t: Like Kane, it is hard to make an argument against a player who has performed at such a high level on a consistent basis. It did, however, take the Belgian a little while to find his scoring stride and he netted just once in the opening nine matches of the campaign. Previous honours: PFA Young Player of the Year 2014, PFA Team of the Year 2013 & 2014 . Name: Diego Costa . Club: Chelsea . Age: 26 . Stats: Apps 30, Goals 18 . Reasons he deserves it: His immediate impact was sensational, smashing seven goals in his first four outings. His presence as the spearhead of Chelsea’s attack has turned them into title winners and he isn’t afraid to put in a shift either. Diego Costa has spearheaded Chelsea's attack this season, with 18 goals in 30 appearances . Costa (right) fires in the winner for Chelsea in their 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield . Costa's bid to become Player of the Year could be hampered by the games he has missed through injury . Reasons he doesn’t: He’s missed too many games because of injury, as well as suspension, and is too often on our back pages for the wrong reasons. It is that edge which will probably dissuade fellow pros from voting for the Spaniard. Previous honours: Player of the Month (1) Name: Sergio Aguero . Club: Manchester City . Age: 26 . Stats: Apps 31, Goals 23 . Reasons he deserves it: Without his goals City’s title challenge would have faded long ago. It has been a poor season at the Etihad. Aguero, though, has managed to mask those shortcomings with his brilliance. His four goals against Spurs and match-winning treble versus Bayern Munich are among the best individual performances of the season. Meanwhile, he was so devastating during his two-goal show at Sunderland that the home crowd rose to applaud the Argentine when he made way late on. Sergio Aguero has again been in prolific scoring form for Manchester City, blasting 23 goals in  31 matches . Aguero (right) has struggled with fitness and has only managed to score three times in the league in 2015 . Reasons he doesn’t: If Aguero managed to avoid what are all-too-frequent visits to the treatment room then City might be pushing Chelsea harder for the league title. He only has three league goals in 2015 and, while his numbers remain impressive, that lack of consistency will cost him votes. Previous honours: Player of the Month (2) Name: David de Gea . Club: Manchester United . Age: 24 . Stats: Apps 37, Clean sheets 13 . David de Gea (left) has been outstanding for Manchester United with 13 clean sheets this season . De Gea shone for United in the early part of the Premier League campaign when United struggled for form . De Gea's displays have been integral to United's top-four charge and he has been their best player . Reasons he deserves it: Only De Gea was spared criticism as United struggled to find their rhythm during the early part of the season. Indeed, there was an argument that, without his points-saving heroics, Louis van Gaal might have come under pressure far sooner. He has matured into the goalkeeper Sir Alex Ferguson thought he would and it is little wonder he is now being courted by the likes of Real Madrid. Reasons he doesn’t: Only the goalkeeper in a title-winning side would land the PFA prize, you feel. For while De Gea has been United’s best player, he has not single-handedly done enough to turn them into challengers for the Premier League crown. Previous honours: PFA Team of the Year 2013 . Name: Alexis Sanchez . Club: Arsenal . Age: 26 . Stats: Apps 43, Goals 20 . Alexis Sanchez hit the ground running at Arsenal following his Barcelona switch, with 20 goals in 43 games . Sanchez hit 14 goals in 18 appearances during his most relentless scoring period this season . Chile international Sanchez has added greater aggression to Arsenal's attacking line with his arrival . Reasons he deserves it: There was a suspicion it would take the Chilean time to settle in the Premier League. Well, he didn’t score in his first four matches but then embarked on a run which yielded 14 in 18. His energy, aggression and will to win – coupled with bags of quality – has made all to the difference to an Arsenal side previously lacking in such vigour. Reasons he doesn’t: His goals have dried up since January and his awesome autumn could well be forgotten by the time votes are cast. However, he is still a certainty for Arsenal’s individual annual honours. Previous honours: Player of the Month (1) Name: Jordan Henderson . Club: Liverpool . Age: 24 . Stats: Apps 45, Goals 7 . Reasons he deserves it: He has emerged as Liverpool’s future captain having taken on responsibility in the centre of the park. Henderson barely misses a minute and is now a certain starter for his country – not bad for a player who Sir Alex Ferguson said could not run properly. He’s also added goals to his game and is a real pro’s pro – it would be no surprise to see him land his fair share of the votes. Jordan Henderson (centre) has continued his development into an essential player for Liverpool this season . Henderson emerged as Liverpool's future captain with Steven Gerrard (right) leaving at the end of the season . Henderson has added more goals to his game and has been ever present throughout Liverpool's campaign . Reasons he doesn’t: It hasn’t been a vintage year for Liverpool and their bid for Champions League football looks set to end in failure. As good as Henderson has been, this will almost certainly cost him the top prize. Previous honours: None . VERDICT: If the bookies are to be believed then the award will be going to last season’s Young Player of the Year, Eden Hazard. However, don’t underestimate the amount of goodwill there is towards Harry Kane within the game and he could well clean up with both the young and senior prizes. And that Roy of the Rovers tale would be a victory for everything we love about the game. Kane certainly gets my vote!","Premier League footballers are voting for PFA Players' Player of the Year .
Eden Hazard and Harry Kane are the leading candidates for the award .
Sergio Aguero, Alexis Sanchez and David de Gea are also contenders .

"Louis van Gaal couldn’t let the moment pass. Manchester United had just rattled off their 13th home win of the season and the Dutchman wanted to crank up the pressure. A comfortable victory over Aston Villa, inspired by two goals from the excellent Ander Herrera and crowned by Wayne Rooney’s magnificent strike, had seen United leap above Manchester City in the table for the first time since November 23, 2013. When you think on January 10 this year the gap between the two clubs was 10 points, the turnaround has been remarkable. But now, as they head into their latest local squabble, there is mounting confidence around Old Trafford that United will not surrender their position. Louis van Gaal has piled pressure on Manchester City ahead of their games against Crystal Palace and United . Manchester United picked up all three points at the weekend by beating Aston Villa 3-1 at Old Trafford . Van Gaal believes Manchester City's players may struggle to get to grips with being in fourth spot . MANCHESTER UNITED (4-3-3): De Gea 6; Valencia 7, Jones 7, Rojo 7, Blind 7: Herrera 8.5, Carrick 7, Fellaini 6.5 (Falcao 77mins): Mata 7.5, Rooney 8, Young 6.5 (Di Maria 70. 6.5) Subs not used: Valdes, Rafael, Januzaj, McNair, Pereira .

Subs not used: Given, Vlaar, Gil, Grealish . Booked: Delph . Scorer: Benteke 80 . Man of the match: Ander Herrera . Referee: Roger East 6 . Is it feasible for City to finish fourth? They face Crystal Palace on Monday evening and Van Gaal believes dropping down two positions will creep into the psychology of Manuel Pellegrini’s squad. Even if City win at Selhurst Park, how will they handle the furnace that awaits this Sunday? ‘It plays a part in the spirit of the players — of our opponents but also our players,’ said Van Gaal. ‘We have more confidence now and when (if) they lose a point against Crystal Palace, then it is also sitting in their minds. ‘I don’t know the individual players of Manchester City so well, so I cannot judge them. But we have a lot of confidence and we haven’t lost so many times at home. The next game is going to be the decisive game.’ Van Gaal is aware recent history spells doom for United. They have lost seven of the last nine Manchester derbies, including each of the last four. Remarkably, they have not beaten City at home since Rooney scored that breath-taking bicycle kick in February 2011. City, few would dispute, have the better squad but, regardless of what happens in south London, will they be able to hold United’s momentum? Can they match their spirit? Big games are bringing the best out of Van Gaal’s men and they are clearly relishing the opportunity that awaits. Manchester United have not beaten City at Old Trafford since Wayne Rooney's wonder goal in February 2011 . Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero scored in his side's 1-0 win over United back in November . Rooney likes playing against Villa — this was his 13th career goal against them. Newcastle (12) are his second favourite opponents. Man United lead rivals Man City by one point . ‘It was another Manchester United, I believe,’ said Van Gaal, when asked how he reflected on the 1-0 defeat he suffered at the Etihad Stadium in November. ‘We have developed the team. That was more in the start of the process and now we are in the end of the process. ‘So I think also the confidence of our players is very high at the moment but also our performances shows that so it’s not the same Manchester United. It’s like the game against Liverpool and the game (coming up) against Chelsea — you have to win these kinds of matches.’ With Liverpool’s defeat by Arsenal effectively ending the doubt over which sides will finish in the top four, it now becomes a question of what order Chelsea, Arsenal and the two Manchester clubs will be after the final games have been played. United’s run-in is laced with demanding assignments — aside from City, they must go to Stamford Bridge on April 18, face a trip to Goodison Park the following week and host Arsenal on May 16 — but they have an aura once more. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling saw red during the Premier League clash at the Etihad Stadium . Man United vs Man City - April 12 . Chelsea vs Man United - April 18 .

Man City vs QPR - May 10 . Swansea vs Man City - May 17 . Man City vs Southampton - May 24 . Villa, stymied by injury problems that Tim Sherwood described as ‘crippling’, simply couldn’t cope once they went conceded in the 43rd minute and the manager, who was noticeably glum afterwards, can at least take solace from the fact Queens Park Rangers will not offer the same threat on Tuesday. ‘We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, it’s going to be a great game,’ said Ashley Young, who admitted he was ‘disappointed’ to not be selected for the last round of England games. ‘Hopefully we will get the three points. Of course it would be nice but we are just taking each game as it comes.’ There was never any hint they would slip up here, bossing the first half and then going through the gears after a slow period after the break to swat Villa aside. Herrara, with his slick passing and industry, was terrific. Rooney’s 14th strike of the campaign, meanwhile, was sensational. ‘It's about momentum, especially when you are going into this vital stage of the season,’ Young added. ‘United teams always come strong at this stage and we are showing in every game just how strong we can be – and even how we finish the game. We will enjoy this but it is all about next week.’ Ashley Young (left, pictured with Herrera) believes his side are building momentum ahead of the derby .","Louis van Gaal cranked up the pressure on Man City after Aston Villa win .

I told him that I was not a prostitute.’ But she did find the Argentine star’s dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. ‘I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,’ she says.

"Louis van Gaal has found the best way to keep Manchester United fans happy is to win at home. Powering past Aston Villa was their 13th victory in 16 Premier League matches at Old Trafford and they have accumulated more points on their own territory, 40, than anyone else. No wonder after a period of irritation earlier in the season, the Stretford End are cheering regardless of whether United play quickly, slowly, pass back to goalkeeper David de Gea or boot it up to Marouane Fellaini . Wayne Rooney (centre) scored a stunning half-volley as Manchester United beat Aston Villa 3-1 in the Premier League on Saturday .

CLICK HERE to view our brilliant Match Zone - including the move for Ander Herrera's opener in Manchester United's win . They remember losing seven home games under David Moyes last season. Two goals by Ander Herrera and a special one from Wayne Rooney were enough to sweep aside lowly opponents  and took United up to third place, a point ahead of neighbours Manchester City who play Crystal Palace on Monday before they are up next at the Theatre of Dreams. Even more importantly, Van Gaal's side are now eight points clear of Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool in fifth. It means his number one priority, restoring Champions League football to Old Trafford, has nearly been achieved. In terms of performance, it was something of the old, something of the new. United used width as their tradition demands with former Villa winger Ashley Young seeing a lot of the ball on the left. But there was a lot of patience and possession too. United had 72% of the ball without a lot to show for it until the reward came after 43 minutes. Daley Blind overlapped for the umpteenth time and on this occason his cutback to Herrera was perfect for the Spaniard to drill home. The second goal didn't arrive until 11 minutes from the end but was worth the wait. Angel Di Maria, on as a substitute, chipped the ball behind Rooney, but the England striker still found a way to score. He fully extended his left luminous green boot, brought the ball under control with his first touch and then spun 180 degrees to lash home his finish on the half-volley with his right. On such goals has the Theatre of Dreams acquired its reputation. But surprisingly there was still work to do for United because David de Gea let a Christian Benteke shot squirm through his body almost immediately aftewards.

It was only when Herrera added his second goal that van Gaal's men were totally safe though anything other than three points would have been a travesty on the balance of play. 'I wanted to come here and compete, and I thought we did that,' said Villa boss Tim Sherwood. 'But United have players who have been round the block, they know when to speed it up and slow it down. The goal just before half-time killed us.' FA Cup semi-finalists Villa could be in the bottom three when they face QPR at home on Tuesday night in a genuine relegation six-pointer. But they will be without a string of injured players including Alan Hutton. taken off at half-time yesterday with an ankle injury, Scott Sinclair, Ashley Westwood and Kieran Richardson. 'I've never known anything like it. Ridiculous,' said Sherwood. Van Gaal was simply relieved to get United's first game after the international break out the way. 'I was afraid before this match because we were playing against a very defensive organisaton. That is not easy to create chances and score goals,' he said.

Herrera shows his emotion at scoring United's opener as he is congratulated by his Old Trafford team-mates . On two-goal Herrera, he added: 'He has always been very good technically but sometimes was not composed at the right moment. But he is developing. He has scored seven goals now.' Villa defended well in the first-half with Marcos Rojo going closest with a long-range shot that was tipped over by Brad Guzan. For long periods, Rooney cut an unhappy figure, beating the turf in frustration and arguing with referee Roger East after beind denied a penalty for Ciaran Clark's early challenge in the area where he seemed to grab the United striker by the back of the neck. If Rooney reflects on it later, maybe his over-dramatic fall to the ground persauded the official not to award a spot-kick. The deadlock was eventually broken when United passed and passed long enough for Blind to escape free down the left. The Dutchman picked out Herrera and he converted from 12 yards for his first goal at Old Trafford since September. When United couldn't get a second goal with Marouane Fellaini going closest, van Gaal sent on Di Maria and Falcao, combined value £103million. Former Villa winger Young made way to jeers from the away fans and cheers from everyone else after a decent display.

However any hope of a Villa comeback were quashed when Herrera (right) added a third in injury time . Di Maria claimed an assist for Rooney's special, pinging the ball across from the touchline. 'He has 10 assists,' pointed out van Gaal, though he baulked at being asked why the winger hadn't started. 'You think we should always pick the most expensive XI? I think not,' was the manager's retort. Surprisingly, David de Gea gave Villa brief hope to make the game 2-1. Herrera gave the scoreline a realistic edge when he burst forward into the penalty area once again to fire past Guzan. The Manchester derby next Sunday is going to be a cracker.

"Forget Swansea, Stoke City and West Ham, the top seven would be seriously challenged by 'Team Pardew' should this manager have had a full season in charge at one club. That is after Crystal Palace, managed by Alan Pardew, beat Manchester City 2-1 at Selhurst Park on Monday night, the English manager's ninth win  in South London since leaving his role at Newcastle at the end of December. His former club have since plummeted in the Premier League while Palace now find themselves threatening the top half, and combining his records at both clubs this season would see 'Team Pardew' sit in eighth place, just five points behind Southampton. Alan Pardew could be a candidate for manager of the year with his record at Newcastle and Crystal Palace .

Newcastle fans were calling for Pardew's head for many years, seen as owner Mike Ashley's puppet, and were sitting in 10th place when the 53-year-old returned 'home' to Crystal Palace. The Eagles were in the relegation zone along with Burnley and Leicester City, struggling to pick up points following Neil Warnock's sacking. But while John Carver has picked up just nine points in his 12 games in charge at St James' Park, Pardew's Palace now have 39 points and are comfortably above the drop zone. A team compiled with Newcastle and Crystal Palace's stats pre/post Pardew would be sitting in 19th (albeit with 22 Premier League clubs now technically involved).

"Brendan Rodgers is considering recalling £20million misfit defender Dejan Lovren at Blackburn in the FA Cup on Wednesday to help save Liverpool’s season. The trip to Ewood Park for a quarter-final replay has even more significance as in comes in the wake of successive morale-sapping Premier League defeats by Manchester United and Arsenal. Saturday’s 4-1 loss at the Emirates was marked by the kind of shaky defending that blighted Liverpool’s early-season play. Brendan Rodgers is ready to recall his out-of-favour defender Dejan Lovren for the FA Cup quarter-final . Lovren has been out of the Liverpool team recently, but could return against Blackburn on Wednesday .

He will be in contention.’ Lovren has made only 16 league starts since he was signed last summer from Southampton but the Croatian may have to step up as Rodgers sticks with the three-man defensive system that helped turn around Liverpool’s season in December.

"Darren Bent pounced in stoppage time to rescue a 1-1 draw for Derby against Brentford at the iPro Stadium. The Bees controlled the game for long periods after going ahead through Alex Pritchard's brilliant strike - but missed chances in the second half came back to haunt them when Bent grabbed his 10th goal for the Rams. Derby went into the game knowing they needed to win to keep their slim hopes of automatic promotion alive and Tom Ince twice went close in the opening seven minutes. Alex Pritchard celebrates his stunning strike with his Brentford team-mates, after putting his side ahead . Derby: Grant, Keogh, Albentosa, Forsyth, Warnock (Whitbread 78 mins), Russell (Dawkins 46), Bryson (Lingard 78), Hendrick, Ince, Bent, Martin . Subs not used: Ward, Roos, Hanson, Thomas .

Goal: Pritchard 21 . Booked: Tarkowski . Referee: Graham Scott . The on-loan Hull winger was caught by Toumani Diagouraga in the fifth minute and curled the 25-yard free-kick over the wall and just past David Button's left post with the goalkeeper desperately scrambling to get across. Button had to plunge to his right two minutes later when Ince curled a shot from the edge of the box but Brentford hit back in the 14th minute when Jota's header set up Moses Odubajo for a shot that Lee Grant pushed away. Grant was relieved to see a free-kick from Alan Judge whistle past his left post after Pritchard was tripped by Raul Albentosa just outside the area in the 22nd minute - but he was beaten by a quality goal six minutes later. Diagouraga tackled Jeff Hendrick deep in his own half and found Jonathan Douglas who quickly released Judge, before Pritchard went past Richard Keogh and Craig Bryson and bent a right foot shot from the edge of the box past the despairing dive of Grant. Pritchard again found space just outside the area but this time he shot straight at Grant before Ince ran down the left of Brentford's defence to drive in a low shot which Button saved diving to his left. Alan Judge strikes a free kick over the Derby wall, but it flies just over the crossbar . Brentford were good value for their half-time lead and they came close to increasing it in the 51st minute when Bryson's attempted clearance spun back to Andre Gray - but Albentosa deflected his shot wide. Gray had another chance four minutes later when Douglas played him in but fired wide from eight yards, then the home fans found their voice when sub Simon Dawkins played Bent in but Button raced off his line to make the save. There was a big let-off for Derby in the 68th minute when Jota pulled the ball back from the edge of the six-yard box to tee up Douglas - but his shot was cleared off the line by Craig Forsyth. Brentford had another chance in the 73rd minute when Stuart Dallas crossed to the back post, where Gray headed over at full stretch and the Rams nearly made them pay when Zak Whitbread flicked on a corner and Button made an instinctive save to push the ball behind. But Derby grabbed a goal they barely deserved in the second minute of stoppage time when Hendrick fired in a low shot and Bent pounced to stab home an equaliser that was tough on Brentford.

"Tony Pulis has discussed pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication he plans to keep the striker beyond the summer transfer window. Berahino is likely to be away with Gareth Southgate’s England under 21 side in the Czech Republic until late June so Pulis has begun his preparations early. West Bromwich Albion were open to bids of £20million for Berahino in January and the 21-year-old has said he would leave to fulfil his desire to play in Champions League football. West Brom manager Tony Pulis has talked pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication the England under 21 striker will remain at The Hawthorns beyond the summer . Berahino has been linked with a move away from West Brom after saying he wants to play European football . Pulis said: ‘Hopefully he's away with the under 21s so I have had a chat with him about pre-season and the time he'll have off but I haven't spoken about anything else to him. ‘I think the kid is happy here, he has played that way and certainly worked that way. We're more than happy to have him here because he has been very good.’ Berahino shares the same agent as Raheem Sterling, Aidy Ward, who was criticised by Brendan Rodgers over the Liverpool player’s contract stand-off. Pulis said: ‘Agents can have a massive influence on players in lots of respects. My argument to that is in the same in life, you get good agents and you get bad agents. Berahino is likely to be included in the England under 21 squad for this summer's European Championships . Berahino scored a vital goal in England's under 21 play-off with Croatia back in October .

To be the best is what they should be aiming for. ‘If I had an agent I'd just say, 'Look after the money, make sure when I finish this job I have enough to look after my family'. I wouldn't be talking to my agent about football.’ Pulis added: ‘I can’t speak for Sterling and I can't speak for the agent as I haven't dealt with that but the one thing I have said about Saido, he has been fantastic here. ‘There's been a real change in his attitude, his commitment to everything we've tried to do has been brilliant.’","Pulis has spoken with his striker about pre-season plans .

"Boss Nigel Pearson insists Leicester have no margin for error in their relegation fight as they aim to close the gap to safety. The Foxes go to West Brom on Saturday bottom of the Barclays Premier League and six points adrift from the survival line. A 2-1 win over West Ham last weekend gave them a first victory in nine league games and ended a run of just two points from a possible 24. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson (fourth right) talks to his squad during a training session . Pearson watches on at the Foxes training ground as he plans their route to Premier League survival . But with eight games left Pearson knows that they cannot afford any further slip ups. 'Our form has to take that upward trend in terms of results. We don't really have a buffer to fall back on, we have to perform here on in,' he said at his pre-match press conference. 'The players have dealt with an awful lot of disappointment but strived to get the performances. That has been the case for the majority of the season. What we have to do now is change those performances into wins. 'People tell me about other people's run-ins but you will survive or not due to your own results. 'We have to keep it in our hands for as long as possible and we need to win more games. That's the reality of the situation but we're capable of it.' Leicester still have to play relegation rivals Burnley and Sunderland and host QPR on the final day, giving Pearson hope. He said: 'We have to play a lot of sides around us. It's nice to have games where we can directly affect their end to the season but the flip side is they will see it the same way. 'It depends how those fixtures go, you win those and the picture changes. What we have to do is manage the swings in mood which will be in the public domain. 'You win a game or lose a game and there's a shift in terms of how people perceive it.' Matthew Upson (centre) is back in contention for the game with West Brom after returning from injury . Dean Hammond (centre) is also back in training with Leicester following a calf problem . Matt Upson (Achilles) and Dean Hammond (calf) are back in training and are available for the trip to The Hawthorns, where Pearson spent time as coach between 2004 and 2006. The Baggies are holding Jeff Astle Day to honour their former striker and raise awareness for the Jeff Astle Foundation. Former Albion striker Astle died in 2002 aged 59 from a brain condition normally linked to boxing after heading heavy leather footballs during his career. And while Pearson believes it is a fine cause he insisted the Foxes cannot get caught up in the day. He said: 'In many ways it's for recognition for an outstanding player and person who has achieved an awful lot for the football club. 'It's great West Brom have decided to make an occasion to celebrate Jeff Astle's contribution and raise awareness of these types of head injury issues. 'But for us, unfortunately, we have to recognise we are part of the day but our own plight is the most important thing. 'What we can't do is get carried away in the occasion.'","Leicester City travel to West Brom in Premier League on Saturday .

"Barcelona's Brazilian star Neymar was left fuming after being substituted by Luis Enrique during the 2-2 draw at Sevilla on Saturday night, according to reports in Spain. Neymar, who scored his side's second goal with a curling free kick, was replaced with the score at 2-1 and 15 minutes to play. Sevilla then scored a late equaliser, and Neymar 'can't understand why he is subbed so much' reports Spanish paper Sport. Neymar's dispute with Luis Enrique features prominently in Spain, while they look ahead to the Madrid derby . The paper points out that the forward has been replaced in 15 of his 34 matches this season, with only Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta being substituted more. With Barcelona still top of La Liga, and challenging for a treble, the paper points out that the club will need to be united in the final run-in. Elsewhere in Spain the attention is focused on the Madrid derby in this week's Champions League quarter-finals. Marca claims that the game is 'like a final', with the two teams playing out a repeat of last year's showdown in Lisbon, while in AS, Real defender Pepe calls for intensity and humility. In Italy the headlines are dominated by Lazio, who moved above their city rivals Roma into second place in Serie A with a win over Empoli .

"With 20 goals to his name this season, Watford captain Troy Deeney is regarded by many as the best striker outside the Premier League. In fact, Deeney has been lighting up the Championship for the last three seasons, scoring 64 goals in 123 league games at an average of over a goal every other game. The next logical step for the Birmingham-born striker is the top flight and, with Watford just a point off the top of the table with five games to go, he could well be skippering the Hornets in the Premier League next season. Watford striker Troy Deeney won the Championship's Player of the Month award for March . Hornets skipper Deeney is hoping to cap off a fine season by leading Watford to the Premier League . Deeney believes he can follow in the path of Charlie Austin and Danny Ings  by becoming a Premier League hit . Watford are currently just one point behind Championship leaders Bournemouth with five games left to play . And Deeney, who was this week named the Sky Bet Championship player of the month for March, makes no secret of his desire to test himself at the highest level. He said: 'I've looked at Charlie Austin, Danny Ings, Rickie Lambert and Grant Holt before that. 'These are all people that have been in the Championship, done well, then held their own in the Premier League. 'There is a sign there that you can really go on (from the Championship). If you go in and apply yourself then you can score goals. 'I want to make sure that when I go up there I'm ready for it and I show what I'm about.' It seems fair for Deeney to say 'when' and not 'if' he plays at the top level because on this season's evidence he and striker partner Odion Ighalo certainly are ready for it. Between them the Championship's most lethal strikeforce have scored 39 league goals this season and Deeney waxed lyrical about his Nigerian strike partner. 'He's a natural finisher,' he said. 'Before Saturday (when Ighalo scored from 20 yards in the win over Middlesbrough) we had been joking that all of his goals were inside the 18-yard box. 'He's definitely a poacher and when he scores he normally scores doubles, one game he got four. He scores in bunches which is a sign of a real good striker.' Deeney is adamant that together he and Ighalo could terrorise Premier League defences. 'I've been and watched a few games this season and I don't see why not,' he said. Watford striker Odion Ighalo has also been in fine goalscoring form during the course of the campaign . Deeney has been impressed with Slavisa Jokanovic since the Watford manager took charge in October . 'I think you have to be very ruthless in the Premier League and we've shown that we can score goals. 'Are we confident we can do it? Definitely.' Watford - currently third in the table and kept out of the top two only on goal difference - joined the promotion-chasing pack late after a turbulent start to the season saw three managers depart before current boss Slavisa Jokanovic took charge in October. But referring to that period Deeney, who has played under seven managers since joining Watford from Walsall in 2010, insists: 'It wasn't that bad.' He added: 'It definitely brought the players closer together. 'It's just one of those things really, in any line of work if your manager changes your job doesn't change.' Watford have won 15 of Jokanovic's 27 matches in charge and Deeney has been impressed by the Serbian's tactical flexibility. Ahead of Saturday's trip to Millwall, he said: 'We've got a talented squad so we can go from 4-4-2 to 4-4-2 diamond to 3-5-2 or 4-3-3. 'His (Jokanovic's) adaptability would be the one thing that makes him stand out.' Former Watford boss Beppe Sannino handed Deeney the captain's armband during his brief spell in charge . But Deeney's role in the revival of Watford's season, not just as goalscorer but as captain, cannot be underestimated. Beppe Sannino made him captain before the start of the season and Deeney seems to have taken to the role like a duck to water. 'I was very vocal anyway,' he said. 'If I've got something to say I'm going to say it anyway, good or bad, and I think that once people know me they respect that. 'If you're doing good I'll tell you you're doing good, if you're doing wrong I'll tell you you're doing wrong. I don't expect anything else of others towards myself. 'The added responsibility of now having to lead even more by example, I think that's the only that's changed. 'But then I think I did it pretty well beforehand, I think that's why they made me captain. They know what I'm about and what I offer. 'But now it's a case of justifying why they have made that decision.' Deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and says it is no coincidence he has enjoyed by far the best three seasons of his career since his release. Deeney has warned his Watford team-mates they have 'three weeks of hard work' ahead of them . 'The two are definitely linked,' he admits. 'But it's more down to personal growth and realising what an opportunity I had, instead of being an idiot and just letting my chance go by. 'I've just grasped it with both hands and become a better footballer and a better person for it, so it (prison) was probably a blessing in disguise.' Captaining Watford in the Premier League next season, Deeney admits, would be the crowning glory after three years' hard work following his release. 'That would be the fairytale ending,' said the 26-year-old. 'But we've got three weeks of hard work before we can even start thinking about that, so I'm just going to keep working and hopefully that fairytale can come true.' You get the feeling Deeney will be playing in the Premier League regardless of what happens in the next few weeks. But  Watford have as good a chance as any of promotion with their talismanic captain in the side.","Watford striker Troy Deeney is yet to play in the Premier League .

"Jeremy Peace, the West Bromwich Albion chairman, will only sell the club to a buyer who will invest money on and off the pitch. Tony Pulis has held conversations with Peace and is adamant the chairman wants to ensure his legacy is maintained.

"Arsenal target Raheem Sterling is a more talented player than Gunners star Mesut Ozil, according to Michael Owen. The former Liverpool forward made the claim before Brendan Rodgers' men lost 4-1 at the Emirates on Saturday - a game in which Ozil netted his side's second goal. Owen's opinion drew criticism on social media but the ex-England man has refused to back down, even after Sterling's disappointing display in north London.

"Robert Lewandowski returned to haunt his former club as Bayern Munich earned a narrow victory against Borussia Dortmund at the Signal Iduna Park on Saturday. Poland international Lewandowski scored the winner on his first visit back to the club he left on a free transfer last summer as Pep Guardiola's side restored their 10-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Lewandowski spent four years at Dortmund, leading them to back-to-back league titles during that period, and offered only a muted celebration when he pounced to give the visitors the lead 10 minutes before half time. Robert Lewandowski beats Marcel Schmelzer to the ball to head Bayern Munich in front against Dortmund .

Roman Weidenfeller saved Thomas Muller's original effort bu the ball fell kindly to the Poland striker . Weidenfeller complains to his defence as Lewandowski makes his way to his feet after scoring .

Bayern suffered a shock 2-0 home defeat by Borussia Monchengladbach before the international break but responded to get their title charge back on track against their former championship rivals. Dortmund were unbeaten in their last eight domestic matches, sitting comfortably in mid-table after rescuing a desperate-looking situation earlier this year that saw Jurgen Klopp's side bottom of the table. But they were behind after 36 minutes against Bayern. Thomas Muller was released down the left channel but his low drive, after bursting towards the box, was parried by Roman Weidenfeller. Unfortunately for the Dortmund goalkeeper the ball rebounded invitingly for Lewandowski to beat Marcel Schmelzer to the ball and head home from 12 yards. Dortmund offered a spirited fightback  as the hosts applied much of the second-half pressure, but the Bayern defence held firm although they had Manuel Neuer to thank after saving brilliantly from a Marco Reus free kick in the closing stages.

"Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla is among a number of players to have offered support to Villarreal defender Mateo Musacchio following his gruesome leg injury.

The Bavarians, runaway leaders in the Bundesliga and through to the Champions League last eight where they face Porto later this month, are eager to repeat their 2013 treble-winning campaign as the season enters its final stretch.

Bayern were without wingers Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as well as David Alaba, who tore a knee ligament and will be out for about two months. They were also missing defender Holger Badstuber, forcing coach Pep Guardiola to overhaul his team and play a new-look midfield with captain Philipp Lahm, Xabi Alonso and Bastian Schweinsteiger.

Guardiola, in his second season in charge after winning the domestic double last year, will have the chance to slightly alter his system again with midfielder Thiago Alcantara making a comeback on Saturday after more than a year out injured. The addition of the skilled Spain international is undoubtedly a major asset ahead of Leverkusen, who crushed Hamburg SV 4-0 in their league game on Saturday. Ribery could also be back in time for Wednesday's game, providing Guardiola with more punching power. Leverkusen, eager to remain in the top four to secure yet another Champions League campaign next season, have won their last five Bundesliga games without conceding a goal as they hit top form.

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has confessed his academy players are not ready to step into his first-team squad, hinting that City may look to cherry-pick the best youngsters from their top-flight rivals. In the week that Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling spoke about his unwillingness to agree a new contract at Anfield, Pellegrini’s comments suggest that City may look to invest heavily in other teams’ homegrown talent this summer. Premier League regulations require clubs to carry at least eight homegrown players, which can include youngsters who have spent three of their formative years at an English club. FA chairman Greg Dyke is pushing for the figure to be raised to 12. Manuel Pellegrini says the academy players at Manchester City are not ready for the first team . Pellegrini's assertions may mean City buy English players like Raheem Sterling to reach homegrown quotas . Everton's England international midfield player Ross Barkley has also been linked with City . But the lack of suitable candidates emerging from Patrick Vieira’s academy means City’s only option will be to buy in the bulk of their quota, with the defending league champions also linked with Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere and Ross Barkley of Everton. City’s current group of home-grown players will be reduced in the summer when Frank Lampard departs and it could be further depleted if James Milner, who wants guarantees of more regular first-team football, opts to leave. Coincidentally, Liverpool is Milner’s most likely destination should he leave but the prospect of Sterling moving in the opposite direction has been increased to the point that bookmakers rate City his most likely destination next season. City’s youth system has come under fire in recent seasons for its lack of productivity. Belgian defender Dedryck Boyata, who has started nine league games in nearly six years at City, is the only former academy player anywhere near first-team contention. Pellegrini said: ‘We must be patient with the academy. Young players are important. Maybe it’s not so easy for young players, especially at big clubs, to play in the first team, with the professional squad. But I’m sure in the future we will have very important players coming from the academy. James Milner could leave City in the summer with Liverpool a potential destination . Arsenal midfield player Jack Wilshere has also been linked with a transfer to City . Defender Dedryck Boyata (right) is City's only academy player near first-team contention . ‘But it’s important to have years of working the same way. But you never know. Maybe some talented young players can do it soon.’ Sterling would fit the bill, if his impasse at Liverpool proves unsolvable, although Pellegrini refused to comment directly about the Liverpool and England forward. Pellegrini said: ‘I think it’s important for big clubs to bring in the best players, that’s the most important thing. If they’re all good players, of course I agree with the quota. All the big leagues — especially the Premier League — need the best players to play.’ City’s homegrown quota is made up of Boyata, Lampard, Milner, Joe Hart, reserve keeper Richard Wright and Gael Clichy, who qualifies from his years spent with Arsenal. They are joined by four academy players — Thierry Ambrose, George Glendon, Jose Angel Tasende and Jose Angel Pozo, although Spaniard Pozo is the only one to have been near the first team this season. A number of young City professionals, including John Guidetti at Celtic, PSV’s Karim Rekik and Marcos Lopes with Lille, are on loan and may be brought back to plug some of the holes next season, although a big investment in English talent via the transfer market seems the only option. Frank Lampard helps make up City's homegrown quota but is leaving for New York at the end of the season . Patrick Vieira is overseeing the City academy's production of youth and homegrown players . Striker John Guidetti is on loan at Celtic but could return to meet quota regulations next season . Meanwhile, Pellegrini is not in action until Monday, when he takes his team to Crystal Palace, and with Chelsea in an apparently commanding lead at the top, the City manager admits his side face eight cup finals. He said: ‘I hope we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end. We will see the way we play. I hope the way we finish against West Brom is the way we must continue. ‘It is not easy to make a clear analysis because they play with one player less. I hope in these eight games we continue playing that way.’","Manuel Pellegrini believes his youth players are not ready for the first-team .

"Gary Caldwell admitted his first taste of management was 'crazy' following Wigan's battling 2-2 draw against Fulham. The Latics may be heading for relegation but they proved they are ready to go down fighting after twice coming from behind to snatch a point at Craven Cottage. Caldwell, at 32 the youngest boss in the league, only replaced the axed Malky Mackay on Wednesday and must have feared the worst when his side conceded after just three minutes to Ross McCormack's strike. Gary Caldwell admitted his first taste of management was 'crazy' following Wigan's battling 2-2 draw . Wigan's Jason Pearce (right) is congratulated by Pennant (left) as he scores the second equaliser for his side . A stylish Jermaine Pennant free-kick hauled Wigan level, only for a stunning long-range effort from Matt Smith put Fulham back in front. But Jason Pearce's 69th-minute effort, when he tucked in a corner at the far post, earned the Latics a point. 'I have just said to the players that I feel very proud of them considering we only had two days to work,' said former Latics skipper Caldwell. 'It's crazy, absolutely crazy. An all-consuming job. But I loved every minute of it and can't wait for the next one. I've had a lot of managers texting me saying 'welcome to the madhouse' and I can see what they mean.' A point lifted Wigan above Millwall, who they face on Tuesday, on goal difference but both teams are seven points adrift of safety. Matt Smith scores Fulham's second goal to restore their lead against Wigan at Carven Cottage on Friday . Smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the Championship match . Caldwell has not been put in charge to perform a miracle, but he still insists there is plenty to play for. 'We'll try to win every game,' he added. 'There's 12 points to play for and we'll try to win every one and see what happens. 'It's going to be a long process to get the club to where we want it to be. But tonight was the way we want to play, that's how this club got success.' Fulham should now be safe, having edged nine points clear of the drop zone, but they were booed off by sections of the home support. Boss Kit Symons' honeymoon period seems to be over, as his decision to take off goalscorer Smith after an hour was met with a chorus of 'you don't know what you're doing'. Fulham captain Scott Parker (right) is hassled for the ball by Wigan's Gaetan Bong (left) at Craven Cottage . The ever industrious Parker (left) dribbles away from the challenge of Wigan's Kim Bo-Kyung (right) 'Matt was shattered,' he explained. 'He's had a lot of football recently and we needed some fresh legs.' Symons has the air of a manager who cannot wait for the season to come to an end. 'It's glass half full, glass half empty,' he added. 'We're a point closer to safety and come the end of the season it might be the point that keeps us in the division. 'It's been a tough season, to put it mildly, and realistically it was probably always going to be like that. When we stay up I certainly won't be doing cartwheels, but I'll breathe a sigh of relief.'","Fulham 2-2 Wigan Athletic: CLICK HERE to read the match report .

"Gary Hooper came off the bench to snatch a dramatic stoppage-time winner to keep Norwich City on track for automatic promotion in the Sky Bet Championship after Neil Lennon's battling Bolton came within minutes of gaining a point. Former Celtic star Hooper's goal sparked jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench in contrast to the dejection of his one-time Parkhead boss Neil Lennon. Indeed, Hooper had been a transfer target for Lennon earlier in the season so his winning goal was a double blow for the Ulsterman. Gary Hooper celebrates after earning Norwich three points with a stoppage-time winner against Bolton . Former Celtic striker Hooper is mobbed by his team-mates as Norwich remained second in the Championship . Bolton: Bogdan, Vela, Dervite, Ream, Moxey, Bannan, Walker (Janko 87), Feeney, Gudjohnsen (Danns 82), Heskey, Le Fondre . Subs not used: Lonergan, M Davies, Trotter, Rochinha, McCarthy . Booked: Walker, Moxey . Scorer(s): Le Fondre . Norwich: Ruddy; Whittaker (R Bennett 71), Martin, Bassong, Olsson, Tettey, Howson, Dorrans, Hoolahan (Grabban 57), Redmond (Hooper 66), Jerome . Subs not used: Rudd, E Bennett, O'Neil, Odjidja-Ofoe . Booked: Bennett . Scorer(s): Dorrans 9, Hooper 90+ . Referee: James Adcock . Graham Dorrans gave the Canaries an early lead as his right-footed free-kick deflected off Josh Vela into the net, but Adam Le Fondre looked to have rescued a point and extended Bolton's unbeaten run to four games. Instead, Hooper lobbed keeper Adam Bogdan - as the Wanderers defenders switched off - to score an invaluable goal. Lennon had promised his side would spoil a few parties in the remaining games of the season with Brantford and Bournemouth coming up in the next few weeks. That looked to be the case until Hooper's strike made it five wins in the last six meetings between the teams. Norwich made the perfect start with Dorrans' deflected free-kick after Vela took down Nathan Redmond on the edge of the area. The Canaries should have doubled their advantage six minutes later as Sebastien Bassong rose highest at a corner but cleared Bogdan's crossbar by some distance. Hooper lobs the ball over Adam Bogdan to spark jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench . Former West Brom midfielder Graham DOrrans celebrates after giving the visitors the lead on Saturday . And the visitors were in total control when Wanderers drew level totally against the run of play. It was so one-sided manager Lennon was poised to bring on Neil Danns to shore up his midfield. Instead, youngster Tom Walker, who had been guilty of delaying a cross moments earlier, learned his lesson. His flashing centre from the left picked out Le Fondre inside the six-yard box and the on-loan Cardiff City striker, back in the side after missing the Easter Monday trip to South Wales, finished with ease. Walker continued to prove a threat to the visitors' defence with his elusive running and was harshly booked for a foul on Wes Hoolahan. Liam Feeney shot narrowly wide from another Walker cross that fizzed beyond three static Norwich defenders before the Canaries rediscovered their composure. Top scorer Cameron Jerome, whose double won the reverse fixture at Carrow Road last October, brought a smart save out of Bogdan while the Hungarian international needed treatment after punching away another dangerous-looking Dorrans free-kick. Norwich striker Cameron Jerome heads towards goal during the clash at the Macron Stadium . The second half was much more competitive and Wanderers were more of a match for their high flying visitors. So much so that Neil brought on Lewis Grabban after 57 minutes for Hoolahan. And Grabban made an immediate impact, bringing out a save from Bogdan before Tim Ream cleared off the line from first-half scorer Dorrans. However, Bolton had their moments going forward too with Le Fondre trying cheekily to chip John Ruddy while Alex Tettey cleared off the line after Dorian Dervite narrowly failed to connect with Walker's corner. Neil's intention's were clear and with 20 minutes left had made his full set of substitutions with Hooper replacing Nathan Redmond and Steven Whittaker going off for Ryan Bennett. The visitors were incensed they did not get a penalty when Russell Martin's cross hit Dean Moxey on the hand. But any ill luck was cancelled out in injury time as hot shot Hooper slotted his winner.","Norwich beat Bolton 2-1 at the Macron Stadium in the Championship .

"Gary Neville has hailed Manchester United as a team that is getting ever closer to being 'the real deal' after a dominant 4-2 derby victory over City at Old Trafford on Sunday. Louis van Gaal's side took a firm grip on third place as they skipped four points clear of their arch rivals in fourth after going behind to an early goal from Sergio Aguero, who also scored a late consolation. After recent wins over Tottenham, Liverpool and now City, Neville was impressed by his former club's performance as a whole ahead of next  week's clash with Premier League leaders Chelsea. Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young celebrate their combined efforts to put Manchester United in the lead . Fellaini headed home United's second goal getting on the end of a cross from man of the match Young . Goal-scorer Juan Mata and United boss Louis van Gaal show their delight at the end of the Manchester derby . 'I think they're getting so confident now,' he said of United, who claimed the win with goals from man of the match Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling, while Michael Carrick pulled the strings from the base of the midfield. Neville said coming into games against Spurs, Liverpool, City and Chelsea, United could have considered seven points a good result. 'They've got nine already - so that's a fantastic three performances,' he says. 'Against Spurs, you were asking the question, are they the real deal? But Spurs were poor that day, they were flakey. So then they go to Anfield and really make you sit up because that is a tough place to play no matter how Liverpool play. Young enjoyed some fortune as his commitment to get in front of his man saw him score the equaliser . City were at sixes and sevens as United took control of the match after struggling in the first 15 minutes . 'Then to come here today, especially with City starting well and going a goal up, that was a proper performance they've put in out there today.' Fellow pundit Niall Quinn declared United's performance 'the best  I've seen since the glory days of (Sir) Alex Ferguson.' Neville added: 'City have been beaten in the areas of passion, hunger and fight, but they were tactically done as well out here today. 'They couldn't handle Manchester United's position on the pitch. It wasn't just a case of Manchester City coming here and being out-fought, they were out-played.'","Manchester United beat Manchester City 4-2 at Old Trafford on Sunday .

"England picked up their first title on the Sevens World Series this season after beating competition leaders South Africa 21-14 in the final of the Tokyo tournament on Sunday. Phil Burgess, Charlie Hayter and Tom Mitchell scored the tries in the final for the English, who bounced back from a thumping group stage defeat to Fiji on Saturday to win a first title since the Wellington Sevens in Feb. 2013. 'I am unbelievably proud of this team. It's a huge effort and we are so grateful to deliver this title,' skipper Mitchell said after victory at a wet Prince Chichibu Memorial Rugby Ground.

"Tracey Neville would say she has never lived in the shadow of her footballing brothers. She might not have enjoyed their fame or their financial success. At the peak of her career as an England netball player who won bronze medals at the Commonwealth Games and World Cup, she earned just £742 a month. But there has been no shortage of ambition and no lack of personality. She is Phil Neville's twin and I ask her which of them, back on January 21, 1977, emerged first. 'I don't think there was ever any way Philip was coming out before me,' she says in a broad Bury accent enriched by an endearing burst of laughter. Tracey Neville, pictured at Hotel Football in Manchester, is Phil Neville's twin and sister to Gary Neville . Neville gives a team talk to her Manchester Thunder players during a match with Surrey Storm last year . England coach and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville poses with his sister Tracey and her friends . It might explain why it is Tracey who has risen to the rank of national head coach first, taking England's netball team to this summer's World Cup in Australia while her brothers continue to combine coaching and broadcasting. Gary has spent the past three years as assistant to England manager Roy Hodgson. Tracey was parachuted into the top job on an interim basis last month and will select a squad of 12 for the tournament in August. Winning it will be no easy task, even if England are ranked third in the world. They failed to win a medal in last year's Commonwealth Games and poor results in a recent Test series convinced netball chiefs to turn to 38-year-old Neville, who has performed impressively as the boss at Manchester Thunder. How England perform will impact on funding with up to £4million at stake. The pressure is on. She revived an ageing Thunder team with an injection of youth and has secured two Superleague titles in three years. They are top of the league and later this month will contest their Superleague semi-final at the Manchester Arena, with some suggesting there are echoes of a certain local football team. Like Gary and Phil, she was first capped for her country at 19, eventually making 81 international appearances before a knee injury forced her to retire — and she says her personality is probably a mixture of the brothers'. Sportsmail's Chief Sports Reporter, Matt Lawton, interviews Neville over breakfast at Hotel Football . Phil Neville, who now works as pundit with BT Sport and the BBC, takes a selfie with his twin sister . Neville celebrates with her Manchester Thunder team after clinching the Superleague title in April last year . 'I think we're all natural leaders,' she says as she tucks into a cooked breakfast at Hotel Football, which stands next to Old Trafford and counts her brothers and Manchester United's other 'Class of 92' players among its main investors. 'I'd say I'm quite intense, like Gary. He and I would clash quite a lot. Not to the detriment of our relationship. We're very close. But Philip would be the mediator.' So Phil's the nice one? 'I think I am,' she says, chuckling again. 'I'm probably not as intense as Gary and I'm not the mediator that Philip is. I'm somewhere in the middle. I have bits of both personality traits. 'But I can definitely hold my own with the two of them. I'm probably the one who winds Gary up, to be honest. Being a girl I probably know how to push his buttons.' She says she was never dazzled by the success her brothers enjoyed at United or by the fact that Gary's best mate was David Beckham. 'I knew them all when they were earning £29.50 a week in digs,' she says. And she claims never to have been the sister her brothers turned to for fashion or girlfriend advice. 'We never had those kind of conversations,' she says. 'And Gary and clothes? I don't think they are ever in the same conversation really (cue more laughter). Neville, who will manage England at the netball World Cup, believes she is a natural leader like her brothers . Gary Neville (left) leads Wayne Rooney, James Milner and Michael Carrick (L-R) in England training . Neville represents England at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur aged just 21 . 'But we have an awesome dynamic. We obviously all have a competitive edge but not to the detriment of each other. As kids we were like a pack of cubs. We always looked after our own and that's still the case today. We rely on that support system.' Even as kids, her brothers treated her as an equal. 'I was never a girl they put in the field when we played cricket or in goal when we played football,' she says. 'I was always pretty good at all sports and I would give it my all. 'I would have been a good footballer. I loved playing. My mum was the footballer in the family. She played as a striker. That didn't rub off because like Gary and Phil I was a defender. In the end the big decision I had to make was between hockey and netball. I'd made some good friends in netball so that was the option I took.' Understandably, there is what she describes as 'a certain connection' with Phil. 'We probably speak more,' she says. 'Because Gary's so busy I would see more of his family, his kids, than I do him. 'He never talks about himself. He won the award last week (best sports presenter at the RTS Awards) and nobody in the family even knew he was up for it. He wouldn't say he wants to be the next England manager because his focus will be on the job he's doing at the moment. And when I told Gary I'd got this job, it was just a one-word text response. 'Brilliant,' he said. There was more from Philip. 'Unbelievable. So proud.' I think he tweeted something. That's the difference.' Before Australia she will draw on the experience of both brothers. Phil spent a season as assistant coach to David Moyes at Manchester United. Given the opportunity she would also like to pick the brains of Sir Alex Ferguson. Neville would love to have a coffee with Sir Alex Ferguson and pick his brains before the netball World Cup . Phil Neville spent last season on the coaching staff at Manchester United, with 10 months under David Moyes . Neville has worked in hospitality and earned a maths degree in Bristol and sports science degree in Chester . 'If he wouldn't mind having a coffee with me I'd love to do that,' she says. 'But I've got 30 minutes booked in with Gary. 'There are certain challenges in our sport. It's difficult for the girls to be full-time, and often their jobs become more important because there isn't the financial support. 'I had some difficult financial times as a player. I had great support from my family but I had to take different jobs to support myself. 'I worked in hospitality and got into coaching education and I studied too. I got a maths degree in Bristol before studying for a sports science degree in Chester. These days I'm working with girls who are doctors, lawyers, zoologists. 'But I think I'm a better coach than I ever was a player. One of my strengths is the integration of young players and the way I build a team around a certain ethos. I also have a good understanding of the game.' The challenge is nevertheless significant, as Australia and New Zealand are the powerhouses in netball. 'The Sport England target is to get to the final but we've never made a final before,' she says. 'Last year we finished fourth in the Commonwealths. The team didn't perform to their best so it's my job to get them doing that. 'Ideally I'd like to have had longer to prepare. In a perfect world you'd get a four-year cycle. 'Right now the future beyond the World Cup is uncertain. We'll just have to see how it goes. But I had to take this opportunity. I've always had such passion for England.' She's certainly not alone there. lnformation on Manchester Thunder's semi-final at the Manchester Arena is at www.manchesterthunder.com .","Tracey Neville is Phil Neville's twin and sister to Gary Neville .

"Wing's Chinese restaurant is in Manchester city centre, and attracts a certain type of clientele. The restaurant's owner – Mr Wing himself – is never afraid to push for as much publicity as possible, and is often snapped in the photographs with the city's celebrities at his five-star venue. Wing's has been 'recommended in the Mitchelin Guide for the past eight years', according to their website, but how else does it lure Manchester's footballers and stars back time and time again like moths to a flame? Here's all you need to know about Wing's restaurant. So, who goes there? Wing's is rarely short of a Manchester United star or two. The Class of '92 – Gary and Phil Neville, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, minus David Beckham – previously dined there. Yet more regular visitors include current first-team players and their manager. Wayne Rooney, in particular, visits the restaurant with his wife, Coleen, and has even helped them with publicity work. The United and England captain celebrated his last two birthdays at Wing's, and held a Q&A session at the restaurant after starring in a video ahead of the Chinese New Year on February 19. Wing's is the go-to place for footballers in Manchester, with Wayne Rooney a regular (pictured previously) Rooney pictured previously at Wing's Chinese restaurant for a Q and A session with United supporters . Coleen (right) turns up as her husband, United and England captain Rooney, held his 26th birthday there . The reputation must spread around the changing room quick, because Radamel Falcao dined at Wing's on the same day he signed for Manchester United in a £6million loan deal from Monaco. Falcao tweeted a photograph with agent Jorge Mendes and his lawyers, Paulo Rendeiro and Carlos Osorio, while enjoying a glass of wine, some prawn crackers and a Chinese meal. There has also been Nani, Sir Alex Ferguson, and plenty others. Radamel Falcao went to Wing's Chinese restaurant on the day he signed for United on loan from Monaco .

Nani (right), currently on loan at Sporting Lisbon from United, turns up at the Chinese restaurant in 2011 . Former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson leaves Wing's restaurant after having a meal in March 2013 . It's a Manchester United haunt, then? Not quite. Visitors from different clubs include Mario Balotelli, Joe Hart, Gareth Barry, and Peter Crouch, among others. There was former Chelsea defender Ashley Cole with Cheryl from their time together, and former Old Trafford youngster Danny Simpson with ex-partner Tulisa Contostavlos, too. While Wing's  appears to be more popular with those from Old Trafford rather than the Etihad, that was not the case on Sunday  following United's 4-2 win over noisy neighbours City.

Ashley Cole went to Wing's to celebrate Cheryl's 25th birthday previously during their time together .

Wing's tends to be more popular with United players but attracts a wide range of celebrities regularly . Gareth Barry, formerly of Manchester City, turns up at Wing's for Rooney's birthday with his girlfriend . City stars Toni Duggan and Isobel Christiansen from their women's team were snapped with United manager Louis van Gaal. Duggan uploaded the photograph on Instagram of her, Christiansen and Everton's Michelle Hinnigan at Wing's, and wrote: 'Heyyy Louis van G!!!! Nice to share a wings with you...... [sic].' The England striker later deleted the post. Some feel it overstepped boundaries, given the rivalry between the red and blue halves of Manchester, and Van Gaal admits he would avoid Wing's following a defeat. 'I can go to Mr Wing's because when you win you can go,' Van Gaal told reporters in a press conference. 'When you lose then the fans are saying, ""what is Mr Louis van Gaal doing? Losing and he goes to the best restaurant of Manchester?"" Now I can go. Maybe I shall go.' Louis van Gaal pictured with Manchester City women's players Toni Duggan (left) and Isobel Christiansen (far right), while they were joined by Everton's Michelle Hinnigan at Wing's restaurant . Peter Crouch is another that has visited Wing's as footballers and celebrities flock to the restaurant . Just footballers, then? Mainly, but not exclusively. Frankie Sandford from The Saturdays has been snapped there, as has model Kelly Brook, and even Andrew Lloyd Webber and Nicole Scherzinger. Not forgetting Clare Balding, and I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here duo Ant and Dec, too. Rory McIlroy attended a meal with Rooney there, too. Celebrities are never far away at Wing's.

Wing Shing Chu owns the restaurant based at 1 Lincoln Square in the heart of the city’s bustling Chinatown district. The man commonly known by Mr Wing used to worked in Manchester's Chinatown before moving to Cheadle Hulme, near Stockport, and opening a Wing's restaurant there. He was so successful, however, that he left his wife in charge of that establishment and opened his flagship restaurant in the city centre. It's only got more popular since. Van Persie previously went to Wing's with Clare Balding and owner Wing Shing Chu (right) got in on the snap . Van Gaal embraces owner of the restaurant Mr Wing after having a meal following United's 4-2 win over City . Is it expensive? If you fancy splashing out, you can. The restaurant's most expensive bottle of wine – a 1983 Chateau Margaux from France – costs £999. Rooney might be able to afford that, but for those of us not on £300,000 per week, there are more reasonable options. Wing's have an extensive a la carte menu, but also two set banquet options coming in at £30.90 or £44.90 per person. Banquet B at £44.90 per person, for example, offers: . Starter - Steamed scallop in shell with garlic and glass vermicelli. Second course - Baked lobster with ginger and spring onions. Main courses - Crispy chilli shredded fillet steak, steamed sea bass with ginger and spring onions in soya sauce, quick-fried sea treasures (monk-fish fillet, scallops and king prawns), stir-fried king prawns and Chinese greens, as well as pak far roasted duck, all served with mixed seafood fried rice. Dessert - Fresh fruit platter. The restaurant's most expensive bottle of wine – a 1983 Chateau Margaux from France – costs £999 . What about the dress code? City striker Balotelli plays by his own rules and clearly did not take notice of the dress code stated on the restaurant's website when he visited with his ex-girlfriend Raffaella Fico. It states: 'We kindly request for smart dress at all times (i.e. no trainers, sandals, shorts, casual sportswear). Your cooperation is much appreciated. Many thanks.'

"They’ve won seven on the spin in the Premier League and made Liverpool look like relegation candidates as opposed to Champions League rivals during Saturday’s first-half slaughter. So why are Arsenal destined to sign off from another campaign celebrating a top-four finish and not a serious title challenge? Finish second they may well, but never have they entered the race for the top-flight crown. This term they are simply the best of the ragged rest, each with their flaws which have made the title tussle something of a ‘no contest’. Arsenal celebrate after a fine strike from Alexis Sanchez put them 3-0 up against Liverpool on Saturday . This is the most impressive team the Gunners have boasted since the dying embers of the Invincibles side of more than a decade ago. They have pace, power, energy and invention in attack – and that is just Alexis Sanchez. At the other end they have hit upon an understanding which has seen them not concede more than once in the league since New Year’s Day. But their failure to marry all of those components over the course of an entire campaign has cost them, again. This year, however, is a reverse of previous seasons. More recently we have built up Arsene Wenger’s side as title challengers until the arrival of spring, only for it all to fall flat. Arsene Wenger watches on as his side cruise to a stylish win over their rivals for a top-four spot . This time, it is a stuttering start which has undermined their progress. By mid-October they had already dropped 13 points. There was talk of Wenger not even seeing the season out, let alone extending his stay into next term and beyond. But is the long-serving Frenchman finally about to hit upon a team which, given the manner in which they’re finishing this campaign, could well be installed as title favourites come August? Should Wenger strengthen in key areas then they would surely be vying for such status at the head of the market. He needs no more Mesut Ozils, no more Santi Cazorlas or Tomas Rosickys. Rather, he needs a new spine and characters with backbone. Mesut Ozil celebrates his goal on Saturday as the German World Cup winner continued his fine form . A central defender, central midfielder and centre forward need to arrive if this current vintage is to avoid going the same way as those who have promised so much yet delivered so little in recent years. Interestingly, Wenger’s policy of chasing the best British talent could be on the way out. Yes, there was the capture of Danny Welbeck last summer, but that was more opportunistic than a long-term pursuit. Welbeck, in turn, has netted just four league goals and watched from the bench as Liverpool were torn apart. So, too, did Theo Walcott. He has the mitigation of injury, of course, but does Wenger trust him to remain fit for an entire campaign? Likewise, Jack Wilshere. Teams which win titles have players who, in short, play. Jack Wilshere (centre) watches on from the stands on Saturday after missing out through injury . Theo Walcott (left) has struggled since returning from a year-long injury lay-off . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Aaron Ramsey have both started just 17 of 31 league games. For the latter, a return of four goals is a sorry show given the 16 he plundered last season. So while there is the promise of better times ahead, issues remain for Wenger to sort. You feel he is finally on the cusp of something exciting at the Emirates. But then we have been there before and it ultimately ends in the celebration of failure. Wenger needs to think big this summer, or else goodwill from frustrated fans could be in short supply.","Arsenal moved up to second with 4-1 win over Liverpool on Saturday .

"Kenny Miller fears Rangers' promotion bid could be derailed by the Ibrox side's rollercoaster run of form. Gers suffered the first defeat of new boss Stuart McCall's six-game reign on Thursday night as they slumped 3-0 at Queen of the South. It was an especially flat display after the high of recent Scottish Championship victories over Hearts and Hibernian. Kenny Miller fears Rangers' promotion bid could be derailed by the Ibrox side's rollercoaster run of form . The Light Blues - who remain behind the Easter Road side in third place on goal difference - now have five games left, starting with Raith on Sunday, to leapfrog Hibs and spare themselves the effort of playing two extra ties in the play-offs. Finish third and they could even be sent back to Palmerston - where they have now lost twice this season - for another testing clash with Queens, provided James Fowler's side see off Falkirk in the race for fourth. But the worry for striker Miller is that Gers' lack of consistency could wreck their chance of a Premiership return. The 35-year-old said: 'Last night was a reminder that we have not turned the corner and that there's a lot of hard work still to be done. Miller (centre) looks dejected as his Rangers side slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Queen of the South . 'It was a performance that summed up out season a little bit. That 'consistency' word has come up a lot this year. 'We seem to have a couple of good performances and then complacency kicks in and we take our foot of the gas. 'If we go back three games to the Hibs result, I don't think anyone could have seen that coming. Fast forward three games and I don't think anyone could have seen the result last night coming. 'We have to nail down that consistency and get to a level of performance that we can pretty much guarantee every week. Rangers had recently secured victories over Scottish Championship rivals Hearts and Hibernian . 'Might this inconsistency come back to haunt us in the play-offs? It could do, yes. 'There is no point winning 1-0 or 2-0 at home and losing 3-0 away - that means you are out. 'It's about getting that level and balance right. We need to get back to where we were at against Hibs and in the first half against Hearts, where I thought we were superb.'","Rangers lost first game under new boss Stuart McCall on Thursday .

"An Australian man who walked free from an Indonesian prison after nine months plans to celebrate his season by heading to the beach. Jake Drage sang a children's song for reporters as he left  a West Java jail nine months after he was put behind bars following a crash that killed a woman who was riding a motorcycle with her teenage daughter. The 23-year-old surfer, who was taken into custody in June last year, said he cannot wait to get back in the water. Jake Drage sang a children's song for reporters as he left a West Java jail nine months after he was put behind bars . 'The first thing I do when I get home, after seeing family, I'm heading straight to the beach, heading straight to the ocean,' Drage said, according to The West Australian.

"Every one of Africa's 54 member countries will vote for Sepp Blatter in next month's FIFA presidential election, the continent's soccer boss said on Tuesday, referring to the 79-year-old Swiss as 'dear Sepp.' In front of Blatter's three challengers, Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football, promised unanimous support in his speech to open CAF's annual congress in Cairo. 'Africa is comfortable having you. Africa stays with you,' Hayatou said, according to a transcript of his comments provided by CAF. Sepp Blatter (left) has received the full backing of African football's president Issa Hayatou (right) Blatter was also present, and made a speech to the African football leaders in his role as FIFA president. Although the individual countries don't have to follow Hayatou's directive, Africa is expected to be a strong base of support for Blatter. With 54 of the 209 FIFA member countries eligible to vote in the presidential election in Zurich on May 29, Africa is the largest of the six continental confederations. The praise Blatter received in Egypt contrasted to his uncomfortable reception at the UEFA congress last month, when his presidency was criticized by the three candidates standing against him, and some European officials. Luis Figo (left) and Michael van Pragg (right) are opposing Blatter and have chosen to run for presidency . Hayatou, a FIFA vice president and now an ally of Blatter after failing to unseat him in 2002, made an apparent reference to that UEFA congress on Tuesday. 'Dear Sepp,' he said. 'I want to reiterate that here in Africa you are never on some strange or hostile territory. You shall always be at home here, on this continent.' Blatter is seeking a fifth term in office to extend a reign that began in 1998. FIFA vice president Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, Dutch FA head Michael van Praag, and former Portugal international Luis Figo are standing against him. Prince Ali bin al-Hussein is the third challenger and the FIFA vice-president was in attendance in Zimbabwe . Those three challengers won't be addressing CAF delegates like they did at UEFA's congress. CAF said the three were attending merely as 'observers.' In his speech, Blatter reflected on Africa's achievements during his time as FIFA president, including the continent's first World Cup in South Africa in 2010. He said Cameroon's Hayatou, who has led CAF for 27 years despite allegations of corruption and an official reprimand by the IOC, was a 'pillar' of African football, according to CAF.","Issa Hayatou, president of African football, said they will support Sepp Blatter in his bid to for fifth term as FIFA president .

"For all the problems that David Moyes had during his year at Manchester United, you wouldn't associate his teams with defensive frailties and a lack of organisation at set pieces. And since taking over at Real Sociedad Moyes has enhanced his reputation as a manager who brings, if nothing else, solidity. In his 21 La Liga games to date Sociedad have conceded just 29 times, climbing from the relegation when Moyes took over, to an extremely comfortable tenth place. Mikel Gonzalez diverts a corner past his own goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli who fails to punch it away . Atletico Madrid celebrate after going two goals ahead after just 10 minutes, killing the match as a contest . Antoine Griezmann (left) is congratulated by Fernando Torres, but didn't celebrate against his former club . Atletico Madrid: Oblak; Gimenez, Miranda, Siqueira, Gamez; Suarez, Tiago, Koke, Turan (Niguez 81 mins); Griezmann (Gabi 90), Torres (Jimenez 61) Subs not used: Ansaldi, Bernabe, Cani, Hernandez . Goals: Gonzalez (OG) 2, Griezmann 10 . Booked: Turan . Real Sociedad: Rulli; Gonzalez, Elustondo, Yuri, Zadldua; Bergara, Ruben Pardo; Zurutuza (Finnbogason 74), Canales (Agirretxe 74), Xabi Prieto; Castro (Granero 81) Subs not used: Martinez, Hervias, Estrada, Zubikarai . Yet, on Tuesday night, Sociedad showed none of the qualities usually associated with their manager, capitulating inside 10 minutes against the Spanish champions. By the time Antoine Griezmann struck the hosts' second goal, lifting the ball over the hapless Geronimo Rulli after the keeper had parried Koke's shot straight to the Frenchman, Atletico could have been four up, and the game was all but over. Arda Turan had already seen his volley hit the post after being left totally unmarked from a free kick, before Mikel Gonzalez diverted the resulting corner past his own keeper after little more than 90 seconds. Soon after Griezmann narrowly failed to connect with a header after yet more shocking set-piece defending, and the former Sociedad man also came close to tricking his way through the visiting defence, only to be denied by a last-ditch tackle. David Moyes looks on as his team showed uncharacteristic defensive frailties at the Vicente Calderon . Mario Suarez holds off Sociedad forward Sergio Canales as Atletico took control and never relinquished it . Atletico Madrid's Turkish star Arda Turan, who struck the post early on, takes of Gorka Elustondo . Against a team who hadn't conceded a single goal in their previous four games, it was suicidal. In response Moyes' side produced next to nothing. Chory Castro brought a save from Atletico's Slovenia keeper Jan Oblak which was comfortable enough, while Sergio Canales swung a leg at a dropping ball from inside the area, only to see it fly well wide. That was about all they managed until a free kick from one-time QPR midfielder Estaban Granero forced Oblak into his first stretching save with three minutes to play. The champions, on the other hand, without looking particularly good, continued to threaten, helped repeatedly by Rulli and his defenders, who seemed desperate to offer chances out of nothing. Mario Suarez was given the freedom of the penalty area from another corner, but couldn't make contact with his volley, before Rulli misjudged a wayward Koke cross, allowing it to land on his crossbar. Torres worked hard and offered a foil for the talented Griezmann before being replaced after an hour . Diego Simeone calls for more for his team as they kept their La Liga title defense alive . The Argentine stopper also flapped at a cross, allowing Guilherme Siqueira an opportunity from close range, but the full-back saw his shot deflected wide. The win means Atletico are only two points behind city rivals and Champions League quarter-final opponents Real Madrid, although Carlo Ancelotti's side have a game in hand, and the defence of their title is not yet over. Diego Simeone was able to rest Fernando Torres for the final 30 minutes, after the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker had run hard, without much success, alongside Griezmann. His side's season will be defined in the coming weeks, while Moyes' early successes in Sociedad means Real's campaign has already reached a successful conclusion, with survival assured. But his side's defending will nonetheless have hurt the former Manchester United manager.","Mikel Gonzalez own goal puts Atletico Madrid ahead inside two minutes .

"Cristiano Ronaldo brought up another landmark in his glittering career with his 300th goal for Real Madrid in his 288th game during the 2-0 La Liga victory at Rayo Vallecano on Wednesday. The 30-year-old becomes only the third player in Madrid's history to achieve the feat and a breakdown of the statistics demonstrate just how relentless a goalscorer he is.

His record against Madrid's biggest rivals is also not to be understated, as he has scored 15 times each against Atletico Madrid and Barcelona. The pair are second on the Portugal international's Madrid hit-list, alongside Getafe. The stats also show Ronaldo's impressive eye for a goal in the final moments of a game, netting an astonishing 61 times between minutes 76 and 90. Over half (161) of his Madrid goals have been scored at the Santiago Bernabeu and he has also found the net 60 times in the Champions League for the club.

"Former footballer Gary Mabbutt was left with a 30inch scar following a five hour operation to save his leg. The ex-Tottenham and England star, 53, was rushed to hospital after waking up at 1am to find that the leg had gone cold back in 2013. Mabbutt's diabetes had led to a clogged artery in the limb and doctors warned him it was 'touch and go' on whether the leg would have to be amputated. Scroll down for video . Horrific scar: Gary Mabbutt has been left with a 30inch scar on his left leg after his diabetes caused an artery to be clogged requiring emergency surgery to save the limb . He was treated at King's College Hospital in South East London, undergoing an emergency five-hour operation. Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal the horrific wound. Mabbutt, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 17, will not be able to play football again, leaving his dream of becoming a manager in tatters. As he is unable to train with players on the pitch, he has been forced to turn down roles in coaching. Emergency procedure: Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal the horrific wound . The Spurs legend has spoken for the first time about the agony he went through and says he hopes to raise awareness of his condition. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'When they talked about battling to save my leg, I realised I was helpless. As a diabetic you know complications can occur. But you think ""It's never going to happen to me"". It is vital to educate everyone with diabetes how to take care of themselves. If you have anything unusual with your feet, tingly toes, blisters, see your doctor.' In 1982, father-of-two Mabbutt became the first diabetic ever to play for England and captained Tottenham to FA cup glory in 1991. Former star: Mabbutt is pictured, left, lifting the FA Cup while playing for Tottenham in  1991 . He was unaware that his diabetes had triggered peripheral arterial disease, clogging up the blood vessels in the legs. Every year, surgeons perform around 8,000 amputations on diabetics in the UK - but campaigners say four out five could be prevented. Amputations cost the NHS £650million a year - and up 80 per cent of the amputees die within five years. Diabates sufferers are entitled to annual eye tests as they are are 20 times more likely to develop sight problems, but Gary Mabbutt wants a similar programme to apply to feet. Experts say millions of diabetics are unaware their condition could lead to foot problems and agree regular checks could save limbs.","Former footballer woke up in middle of the night to find his leg was cold .

"Diego Simeone and Carlo Ancelotti both hailed Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak, who made a string of excellent saves to keep Real Madrid at bay. The Champions League quarter-final first leg clash at the Vicente Calderon finished goalless and that was largely thanks to an outstanding performance from the Slovenian goalkeeper. He made a phenomenal save to deny Gareth Bale in the fourth minute and another fantastic stop kept James Rodriguez from opening the scoring in the first half. Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak denies Gareth Bale an early goal at the Vicente Calderon on Tuesday . Oblak gets down low to keep out a shot from Real Madrid's James Rodriguez in the second half . 'They are one of the best teams in the world at defending. Oblak did a great job,' said Real Madrid boss Ancelotti. 'I think, above all in the first half we deserved more than 0-0. Real Madrid's first half was fantastic, we played very well, with personality. 'The second half was different because they pressured us more and we had difficulty keeping possession. 'The result was not good, but we have gained confidence from that game, from what the team showed. The result is the best of the 'worst' results. 'They are little details, we had opportunities and everyone did great work in attack, but we didn't finish well. We have to repeat this performance in the Bernabeu next Wednesday. Carlo Ancelotti wants his side to repeat their performance at the Bernabeu next week despite failing to win . Cristiano Ronaldo is thwarted in his attempt to open the scoring against rivals Atletico Madrid . 'After this game there is still no favourite. It's as it was before we started. We have to repeat the game we played in the first 45 minutes. With two draws, you can still go through.' Simeone was also impressed with the performance of Real Madrid in the first half, but more so with that of his goalkeeper. 'In the first half the opponents were good. Oblak was great, especially for Bale's chance. 'And the best thing was the reaction we had. Any other team that had been damaged as we were in the first half would have ended up conceding. 'But the game became much closer to what we had imagined at the start.' Simeone also did not want to put the blame on Sergio Ramos for an incident which saw Mario Mandzukic left with a bloodied face.

'Mandzukic had a hard game and competed against Ramos and Varane who are extraordinary players,' said Simeone. 'The hit with Ramos happened without him meaning to, so let's speak nothing more of it.' The teams meet again on Wednesday April 22, and Simeone, whose side have not lost to Ancelotti's in any of the seven clashes this season, is convinced that it will be a great game.

Amanda's friend Ashley Blocker says Benji was just behind his wife of nine years in the Palmetto Half Marathon. 'He was four minutes behind her,' Blocker told WLTX. 'I'm sure he thought well I'll catch up with her at the finish line and she'll gloat about how she beat me and we'll go about our day, you know. It makes you hold people a little bit tighter and not take things for granted.' Blocker met Glover at Fitness 535 in Columbia, which Glover co-owned.

"Once the greatest golfer in the world, but years of bad form and injury have taken their toll on Tiger Woods and on Tuesday he looked grateful just to have the support and adoration of his two young children and longterm girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. Woods, 39, was pictured hugging Sam, 8, and Charlie, 6, during the second day of practice at the Augusta National Golf Club, Georgia, ahead of his latest attempt at a comeback at The Masters 2015. The 14-time major winner certainly needs all the support he can get after he recently dropped out of the world's top 100 rankings for the first time since September 1996. Scroll down for video . Happy family: Former world No 1 Tiger Woods enjoyed some quality time on the course at Augusta on Tuesday as he was joined by his children Sam, 8, and Charlie, 6, as well as longterm girlfriend Lindsey Vonn . Stepmom in waiting? Ski champ Lindsey, 30, looked like she had adapted well to her new role as she chaperoned  Wood's two young children on Tuesday . She kept one arm easily draped over Sam's shoulder as she chatted to Rory McIlroy . Wood's two children are the legacy of his six year marriage to former Swedish model Elin Nordegren which ended adruptly after reports of his countless infidelities emerged in 2009. The couple divorced the following year. These days Woods is dating Vonn, herself a four-time world champion and one of the most decorated female skiers in the world. The pair have been together for over two years and during Woods' recent break from golf he was regularly spotted supporting her on the slopes. Woods declared himself ready to compete for a fifth Masters title after completing 11 holes of practice at Augusta National on Monday. The former world No 1 has started just two events in 2015, shooting a career-worst score of 82 to miss the cut in the first of them and withdrawing through injury after just 11 holes of the second on February 5. That led to the 14-time major winner taking a break from competition to work on his game, during which time he dropped outside the world's top 100, a slide which continued on Monday as he fell from 104th to 111th. Woods, 39, was pictured hugging Sam, 8, and Charlie, 6, during the second day of practice at the Augusta National Golf Club ahead of his latest attempt at a comeback at The Masters 2015 .

Woods hasn't won a major since the 2008 US Open and the last of his four Masters wins was a decade ago, with the American only confirming on Friday that he would compete at Augusta this year. 'I felt like I had to get my game into a spot where I could compete to win a golf tournament,' he said. 'And it's finally there.' 'There are not many people that have played the game of golf like he has. The game of golf is better because of Tiger Woods,' said his long-time friend Mark O'Meara. 'He is in a good place and I think he is fired up about it. He will be nervous on Thursday but I think he will be fine.' Woods was ranked 433rd when he turned professional in September 1996. He then jumped to 75th after landing his first victory as a professional at the 1996 Las Vegas Invitational, the first of 79 PGA Tour titles. Woods first moved to world No 1 when he finished 19th at the 1997 US Open. The American spent a record total of 683 weeks at the top of the rankings until he lost the No 1 spot to Australia's Adam Scott in May 2014.

"Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid couldn't be separated in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final showdown on Tuesday. The two giants from the Spanish capital played out a goalless draw, meaning all is left to play for in the second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu. Here, Sportsmail rates the players in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final at the Vicente Calderon. ATLETICO MADRID . Jan Oblak 9 - Blocked everything in the first half as a wind-assisted Real Madrid looked like putting the tie beyond doubt in the first 45 minutes. Had less to do in the second half but did it well. A man of the match display from the 22-year-old. Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak made a big save to deny Gareth Bale in the early minutes . Juanfran 7 - He was rattled, along with the rest of the team, in the first half but he played his part in keeping Madrid at bay. Miranda 7 - Will not have put any watching suitors off with another solid display alongside Godin - that is the third time this season Real have failed to score against Atletico Madrid at the Calderon and Miranda is a major reason for that. Diego Godin 7 - A rare slip early on let Bale in but the Welshman failed to punish the Uruguayan and he recovered well to marshall the team to another clean sheet against the European champions. At times in the first half he must have been seeing flashbacks of extra time in Lisbon but came through without conceding. Atletico Madrid centre-back Diego Godin rises higher than Sergio Ramos to attempt a header on goal . Guilherme Siqueira 6 - No mystery why Diego Simeone wants Felipe Luis back at the club next season. Siquiera is a threat going forward but a liability defensively and will be replaced in the summer. Arda Turan 7 - Always bright going forward and tested Casillas in the second period with a shot the Spain keeper did well to save. Will be vital in nicking a goal at the Bernabeu next week. Mario Suarez 6 - Forced a fine second-half save from Casillas but was just as blown away by Real in the first 45 minutes. Will still be a steal for someone at the end of the season if, as expected, he moves on. Gabi 6 - Simeone's soldier worked hard in defence in the first period but maybe lacked invention in the second period as Atletico took the initiative. Cristiano Ronaldo is crowded out by Atletico Madrid's Mario Suarez (left) and Gabi . Koke 6 - Currently struggling to live up to those 'new Xavi' tags. Still a tremendous prospect and gave as good as he got against Real's trio of Modric, James and Kroos. Antoine Griezmann 7 - You can see why he has scored 21 goals this season in a little over 40 games. He is always bright and showed pace and surprising strength in the first period to pull away from Ramos. Tough to play against and he will be important for Atletico on the break at the Bernabeu. Mario Mandzukic 7 - The old warhorse was elbowed by Ramos, bitten and punched by Carvajal and booked for complaining. He was a bloody hero too and had to be bandaged up midway through the second half. Still lacks that pace to pull away into space that Diego Costa has. Substitutes: Raul Garcia (Griezmann 77), Torres (Koke 83). Not used: Moya, Tiago, Saul, Jesus Gamez, Gimenez. REAL MADRID . Iker Casillas 7- Stayed awake in the first half as Real poured forward but Atletico Madrid still threatened on the break. Also kept out Mario Suarez' late shot as Real managed to hang on. Iker Casillas makes a save as Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres goes for the ball . Dani Carvajal 7 - Was used as an auxiliary winger in the first 45 minutes as Real tried to take advantage of Siqueira’s weakness. Also scrapped at the back and landed a punch and a bite on Manzukic as tempers frayed. That might still cost him his place in the second leg. Raphael Varane 8 - Real Madrid's best performer. We knew he was quick but how quick! His first half sprint down the right was worthy of Bale. Is there a quicker defender in Europe at the moment? Quite possibly not. When Pepe pulled out before the start of the game many Real Madrid fans would have feared the worst but Varane never put a foot wrong. Raphael Varane was in excellent form for Real Madrid in defence at the Vicente Calderon . Sergio Ramos 6 - Left trailing in Griezmann’s wake early on but was a match for Mandzukic. Solid but without the heroics of Lisbon and that last-minute goal. Marcelo 7 - Asked to attack less in the first half with Carvajal trying to do more damage on the other flank. Did all that was asked of him defensively without shining going forward as he can do. Booked and will not play second leg. Luka Modric 7 - Majestic in the first half as Madrid dominated but faded like his team in the second. Still the most complete midfielder that Real Madrid have and they were never going to lose 4-0 as they did in February without him. He will be vital in the second leg. Luka Modric was majestic in the first half for Real Madrid, but he faded along with the team in the second . Toni Kroos 6 - A shame that he has less license to attack in his current incarnation as Madrid’s holder. Covered ground, got Madrid passing and still managed a shot that Oblak saved, but wouldn't he have more influence on games if he played slightly further forward? James Rodriguez 6 - Only just back from injury and it showed in the second half. Could easily have made way for Isco, who eventually replaced Benzema. Has magic in his boots and had a fine chance to win it on the night but couldn't take it. Gareth Bale 7 - Provided cross after cross in the first half as he tormented Siqueira but they came to nothing and Madrid were left to rue the chance he had when Godin slipped and he was through on Oblak’s goal. He will be blamed because of that miss but worked hard and could still be key in the second leg with Atletico's weakness at left back. Bale missed an excellent opportunity to give Real the lead and a priceless away goal . Karim Benzema 5 - Struggles to score against Atletico and was taken off in the second half as he once again failed to puncture their rearguard. Missed a fine chance in the second period when for some reason he flicked the ball back towards Ronaldo instead of trying to beat Oblak himself. Cristiano Ronaldo 6 - Had several free-kicks in the first half that failed to trouble Oblak, Also failed to connect with those excellent first-half crosses from Bale. Atletico Madrid are a tough nut to crack and the world’s most expensive forward line couldn’t find the vital away goal. Ronaldo was just as responsible as Bale and Benzema for that. Substitutes: Arbeloa (Carvajal 85), Isco (Benzema 76). Not used: Navas, Pepe, Khedira, Jese, Illarramendi. Ronaldo endured a frustrating evening as he was unable to find a breakthrough for his team .","Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid draw 0-0 at Vicente Calderon .

"Sheffield Wednesday claimed all three points against Championship play-off hopefuls Brentford with a 1-0 win thanks to Kieran Lee's second-half goal. With both teams playing with high defensive lines at Hillsborough there were a high number of long balls attempted by each side but, with few finding their mark, the game produced nothing of note for the vast majority of the first half. It took until the 35th minute for a decent chance to present itself when a whipped cross found Caolan Lavery in the box but the Owls striker could not wrap his foot around it and the ball sailed wide of the post. Kieran Lee (second left) opens the scoring for Sheffield Wednesday with the only goal for the game . Lee (right) is mobbed by his team-mates after he scores the first goal for the home side . The second half started in a livelier fashion to the first and that was evident after 49 minutes when some clever play from Brentford around the box presented Andre Gray with an opportunity to get a shot on goal but his effort skimmed agonisingly past the post. However, the promise of exciting football and the chance of goals petered out as the half wore on. Both sides managed to work themselves into good areas but could not produce the final pass to create clear-cut scoring opportunities. A mistake from Harlee Dean looked as though it had gifted Wednesday with a sure-fire goal. Sergiu Bus collected the ball and made a run towards goal with Chris Maguire at his side but the pair could not make the two-on-one situation count as Bus' lay-off to Maguire was hit straight into the midriff of James Tarkowski. Alan Judge (right) is dejected after missing a chance  as Wednesday keeper Kieran Westwood looks relieved . Mark Warburton watches on as his Brentford side lose and suffer a blow to their promotion hopes . The breakthrough finally came in the 75th minute when Lee ghosted into space in the box and was unmarked as a parried ball from David Button fell at his feet. He made sure his shot found the back of the net as he rifled home from six yards out. Brentford had a chance to strike back five minutes later but, having found himself one-one-one with the goalkeeper and with two of his team-mates to the left of him, Alan Judge blasted the ball over the keeper and over the goal. Another mistake from Dean almost gifted the Owls a second goal but instead of running into the space he had available, Bus decided to shoot from outside the box and could not keep his effort on target.","Kieran Lee's second-half goal wins the game for Sheffield Wednesday .

Hall scored with his first touch just moments after coming off the bench to keep the Pilgrims on course for a place in the Conference North play-offs. And it put a smile on the face of Lewis, his on-off girlfriend in the popular Essex-based ITV show, who was watching on at York Street.

Novak Djokovic perhaps? Or fellow Scotsman Alex Ferguson? The answer is a resounding 'not likely'. When Murray, 27, says 'I do' with his long-term girlfriend, also 27, on April 11, the guests wishing them well in his hometown of Dunblane will be largely a gathering of close family and friends. Low-key: In spite of high profile friendships with the likes of James Corden, Andy Murray and bride-to-be, Kim Sears (pictured here when Murray received his OBE in 2013) haven't invited many big names to attend their wedding in Dumblane this weekend .

But the biggest name likely to be in attendance at Dunblane Cathedral, where the couple are tying the knot, is one-time British tennis star Tim Henman. Indeed, when the sport's world number one, Novak Djokovic, was asked by a journalist recently if he would be attending the celebration, he replied with a curt: 'Not invited', before following up with a more charitable: 'But I wish him all the best.' As one of Murray's fiercest rivals on the court, it's not surprising Djokovic isn't at the top of the guest list but it seems that, unlike a lot of famous faces, the couple have taken a more low-key approach when it comes to who to invite. Murray has said: 'There won't be any celebrities as such. 'I don't have any celebrity friends so it wasn't something that was planned. '[It'll be] Everyone who we're close to, people we've spent a lot of time with in the past but also people we see ourselves spending time with in the future. 'That's how we came up with the names. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I'm sure a few things will come up next week but it's pretty much sorted.' Who made the list? British player Jamie Delgado (left) is a close friend of Murray's but celebrity pals such as James Corden (right), who admittedly may well have other fish to fry in the US, won't be attending . There will be names from the tennis world in attendance but certainly not players who are as well known as the likes of Nadal or Federer. Murray has invited Dutch doubles player Jules Rojer, who he spends time with while training in Miami and Davis Cup team mate James Ward. Another British pro Jamie Delgado will also attend. Bride-to-be Kim was spotted cheering on her fiancé this weekend as he battled Novak Djokovic in the men's final at the Miami Open before the couple fly back to Scotland ahead of their nuptials. For the 27-year-old’s many fans and friends in the town, it means at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport, played out on the streets of the community. It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at luxury hotel Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck – so they too could toast his big day. The reception will be held at Cromlix, which Murray owns. There's a friendly rivalry on court between Andy Murray and tennis world number one Novak Djokovic but the Serbian won't be attending Murray's nuptials this weekend . Lady in waiting: Kim Sears watched her husband-to-be lose to Novak Djokovic in the Miami Open in Key Biscayne, Florida last weekend. Hundreds of well-wishers are expected to welcome the couple as they arrive at Dunblane Cathedral, before Andy and Kim hold their wedding reception at luxury hotel Cromlix House . The 300-seat, 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix, which seats only 28. Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day. Murray’s uncle Niall Erskine said: ‘I’m sure it will be a popular decision, as he’s had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. Andy has admitted that, food aside, he's left much of the preparation for the big day to his betrothed: 'Kim’s been pretty much doing it' 'I’ve tried to help out when she has asked, but I haven’t been over-involved. I did all the food and cake tasting which I really enjoyed, although I didn’t think I was going to. He added: 'It’s a big day for Kim. Pretty much everything is taken care of now. She seems fairly relaxed but as we get closer that might change.'","Andy Murray and Kim Sears will tie the knot on Saturday April 11 .

"Hillary Clinton's 'Everyday Americans' video has been given an 18 rating by a Russian television network - because it features two men holding hands. Dozhd TV, an independent network, fears the video launching Clinton's White House bid may fall foul of Putin's 'gay propaganda' laws - which allows the imposition heavy fines for promoting homosexuality to people under the age of 18. Clinton's video not only features Democrat campaigners Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson, from Chicago, Illinois, holding hands, but talking about their up-coming wedding. Restricted: A Russian television network has given Hillary Clinton's video an 18 rating because it features a gay couple, who are planning a summer wedding, holding hands . Equality: Jared Milrad (pictured right) and his fiancé Nate Johnson, were delighted to be included in the video, saying it showed off the changing attitudes of the U.S. Milrad's voice is heard in a voiceover saying: 'I’m getting married this summer to someone I really care about.' The inclusion of the segment has won widespread support, and highlights Clinton's own stand on equality. Milrad himself has said he  was overjoyed to be part of the Clinton roll out - and part of a large-scale change in U.S. social attitudes. 'It shows how far we've come,' said Milrad, a 31-year-old lawyer and social activist, pleased that public support for same-sex marriage rights has grown so far as to appear in a presidential campaign launch. But it is at odds with Russia's view on LGBT rights, which have become increasingly restrictive during Vladimir Putin's presidency. However, Dozhd, an opposition network, told ABC News it had acted before being instructed by the Russian government. If they had aired it without the warning, the company could have faced a fine of as much as £13,200 under 2013's gay propaganda laws. Dozhd is not the only company to take preemptive action like this: in March, Ikea pulled its online magazine IKEA Family Live, which 'demonstrates various aspects of home life regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation'. The Swedish retailer decided to remove it as there was a risk 'some material in our magazine can be considered as propaganda'. Backwards: But while the U.S. may be becoming more inclusive, Russia has recently been putting in place more repressive laws as the government becomes increasingly anti LGBT rights . Fine: Opposition television network Dozhd decided to give it the rating to avoid getting a £13,200 fine . Differing views: Putin (left) and Clinton (right) are on other sides of the divide when it comes to LGBT rights - with the former First Lady being a staunch supporter of equality . But it is not just the U.S. and Russia as countries which are at odds with each other: Putin and Clinton hold very differing views personally as well. Speaking in 2014, Putin claimed there was a need to 'clean up' homosexuality in Russian order to drive up the country's birth rate, and defended the country's right to pass such a law. The Russian leader - who claims he has gay friends - has gone as far as to link gay people to pedophiles in the past. Meanwhile, the same year Putin signed the gay propaganda law into being, Secretary of State Clinton had publicly come out in support of gay marriage. 'LGBT Americans are our colleagues, our teachers, our soldiers, our friends, our loved ones, and they are full and equal citizens and deserve the rights of citizenship- that includes marriage,' she said in the video. 'I support it personally and as a matter of policy and law. 'Like so many others, my personal views have been shaped over time by people I have known and loved, by my experience representing our nation on the world's stage, my devotion to law and human rights, and the guiding principles of my faith.' Clinton also has a lot of support within the LGBT community, with the nation's largest lesbian political action committee launching Lesbians4Hillary to support her bid for the White House. Lesbians4Hillary, co-chaired by pioneering tennis great Billie Jean King, said: 'Hillary Clinton is a proven leader and she has a strong track record when it comes to inclusion -- specifically for women and the LGBTQ community.'","Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson filmed holding hands for campaign video .

Albion are still not out of danger towards the bottom of the table and are seven points above the drop zone with three games left.

Birmingham's highly-rated winger Demarai Gray was on target for the second successive game as his strike rescued a point in City's 2-2 draw against Blackburn at St Andrew's. The hosts twice came from behind to salvage a share of the spoils in the Sky Bet Championship fixture with Gray following up his winner against Wolves last weekend with another classy piece of finishing in the 78th minute. Blackburn captain Matt Kilgallon had put Rovers ahead after just eight minutes with his first goal in over a year. A stirring second-half fight back from Birmingham saw them draw level when full-back Jonathan Grounds grabbed a 64th-minute equaliser. The ever reliable Jordan Rhodes looked to have earned Blackburn only their second win in their last five Championship games with his 18th goal of the season four minutes later.

But Gray popped up to ensure Birmingham extended their unbeaten home record to seven games, while Rovers have now not been beaten in eight league and cup matches on the road. Adam Le Fondre's seventh goal of the season rescued a point for Bolton and ensured Charlton's third successive SkyBet Championship draw. The on-loan Cardiff marksman netted for a second successive game after 78 minutes when it seemed Charlton were comfortably protecting Frederic Bulot's ninth-minute opener. Wanderers had goalkeeper Adam Bogdan to thank for keeping it at 1-0 before Le Fondre drew level with Craig Davies at the head of the Trotters' goal charts to salvage a 1-1 draw for Neil Lennon's men.

"A woman is in a critical condition after falling 30 metres from the highest lookout in Blue Mountains when she slipped trying to retrieve her mobile phone. The 44-year-old, named by locals as Donna Christie, slipped and fell from Hassans Fall lookout at Lithgow on Tuesday afternoon, the ABC reports. She was bushwalking with a male friend and her two children, aged 12 and 13, when she dropped her phone at the lookout, which is almost 1,100 metres above sea level. The 44-year-old, named by locals as Donna Christie, slipped and fell from Hassans Fall lookout at Lithgow on Tuesday afternoon . She is believed to have suffered serious head, spinal and chest injuries when she plunged 30 metres. Her friend raised the alarm and it took two hours for police, paramedics and the Lithgow Volunteer Rescue Squad to rescue the woman. 'The paramedics were assisted by emergency services personnel to stabilise the then unconscious patient, lift her back up to the top of the cliff face, where an ambulance helicopter was then dispatched from Sydney,' an Ambulance spokesman said. She was bushwalking with a male friend and her two children, aged 12 and 13, when she dropped her phone at the lookout, which is almost 1,100 metres above sea level . She is believed to have suffered serious head, spinal and chest injuries when she plunged 30 metres . She was airlifted to Westmead Hospital in Sydney where she remains in a stable condition. 'It was one of those tragic accidents that could have been avoided,' Lithgow police inspector Chris Sammut said. 'In this case, it would appear that she's accidently dropped her phone and in trying to retrieve it, she's lost her footing and fallen.' Inspector Sammut said parts of the lookout didn't have fencing and walkers needed to be vigilant to avoid risks. 'We have to weigh up whether a mobile phone is worth a life and obviously the answer is 'no',' he said. 'The phone can be replaced.'

"Newcastle midfielder Rolando Aarons may have played his last game this season after suffering another injury setback. The 19-year-old was in contention to play for the club's under-21s against Derby on Wednesday evening along with fellow long-term absentee Siem de Jong. However, it is understood he has succumbed to injury once again and it is feared his campaign could be over. Newcastle midfielder Rolando Aarons has suffered another injury setback and may not play again this season . The 19-year-old was in contention to play for the Magpies' Under 21s against Derby on Wednesday . The Magpies declined to comment, but Aarons' loss would be yet another blow to head coach John Carver, who has seen his side defeated in each of its last five Barclays Premier League games amid a suspension and injury crisis which shows few signs of abating. Midfielder Moussa Sissoko was sent off during Monday night's loss at Liverpool to ensure his own enforced spell on the sidelines just as Carver prepares to welcome skipper Fabricio Coloccini back from a three-match ban. Carver can not call on striker Papiss Cisse, who has three more games to serve of his suspension, while Steven Taylor, Paul Dummett, Massadio Haidara, Cheick Tiote, Aarons and De Jong have all been missing for some time with most having kicked their last ball of the campaign. Newcastle had hoped Aarons' pace and direct approach would give them some fresh impetus with their season having careered to a halt in recent weeks. The exciting winger has made only five senior appearances to date this term, the last of them on November 1 when he was used as a first-half substitute in a 1-0 league win over Liverpool at St James' Park.Â .

"Most parents have the souvenir of a scan of their child in the womb at 12 weeks. The must-have for IVF mums and dads these days, however, is a video and pictures right from the moment of conception. The images are thanks to revolutionary technology that allows medics to record the microscopic miracle of life – from fertilisation to the division of cells, right through to the growth of an embryo. Hundreds of parents are now the proud owners of these EmbryoScope images, which are also helping scientists learn more about the IVF process. Scroll down for video . Pictured is the very first cell division of Pixie Morley, now aged nine months, taken using the revolutionary EmbryoScope technology . Sally and Stephen Morley (pictured with their daughter Pixie) are one of some 1,500 couples in Britain who have had babies using EmbryoScope technology . Sally and Stephen Morley are among them. The grainy grey and white picture on this page shows the first cell division in the creation of their IVF baby, Pixie. A tiny camera, placed inside an incubator, films the reproduction process. As well as allowing parents to watch back the moment the embryos form, the technology – developed in the US – also allows experts to select the best possible embryos based on how they form during the conception process. This narrows a mother’s chance of miscarrying. The Morleys, from Walsall, had spent months trying to have children naturally before opting for IVF. Mrs Morley, 38, the head of a nursery, said: ‘I knew time was against me being 36 when we started trying so when I failed to get pregnant each month I knew we should have fertility tests as soon as possible.’ While the couple were undergoing IVF, the EmbryoScope technology was introduced at the Midland Fertility Clinic, allowing them to be the first in their area to capture their child’s conception on camera. The technology allows medics and parents to watch the cell dividing. Pictured is the cell division of now nine-month-old Pixie . In October 2013, the embryo was transferred into Mrs Morley’s womb and within two weeks she was told by doctors that the process had been successful. Now, nine months after Pixie’s birth, she is still able to re-watch the moment her daughter was conceived. Experts have hailed the technology as one of the most important developments in IVF. Professor Simon Fishel, who is boss of Care Fertility, the first clinic in Britain to use the EmbryoScope, said: ‘We now know that embryos that do make babies and embryos that don’t make babies do different things. 'And to be able to see this in a time-matched movie and to be able to analyse it scientifically is absolutely wonderful science for us.’ Professor Fishel, who was part of the team that produced first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, in 1978, said the EmbryoScope was revealing the secrets about what happens to embryos as they develop – and why it is that around 70 per cent of them do not actually make babies. The videos were also an emotional milestone in the process of becoming a parent, Professor Fishel said. ‘The couple can see the process of fertilisation, see the cells divide, see the number of cells grow and see them produce an embryo…it is nothing short of observing the wonderful miracle of life.’ The video given to parents is a sped-up version of the process which occurs before the embryo develops. Professor Fishel said his patients were ‘awestruck’ when given the footage but that the clinic only gave parents the video once a mother had fallen pregnant. He added that, at across the Care Fertility clinics, 1,000 couples, who had gone on to have a baby, had been given footage of their embryo’s development.","New technology allows parents of IVF children to view babies' conception .

"Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has sought to play down Neymar's petulant reaction when the Brazil forward was substituted in Saturday's 2-2 La Liga draw at Sevilla. Neymar, who scored a superb free kick to make it 2-0 to Barca after Lionel Messi's opener, was clearly furious at being replaced by Xavi with around 20 minutes left and Spanish media speculated he might be dropped for Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg at Paris St Germain. Luis Enrique declined to reveal who would start the match at the Parc des Princes but did make it clear that he was the one in charge and urged all his players to respect that. Luis Enrique has played down Neymar's angry reaction to be substituted against Sevilla . Neymar (left) speaks with Brazilian team-mates Adriano (centre) and   Rafinha during a training session . Barcelona face Chelsea' conquerors Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday in the Champions League . 'I haven't seen the footage,' Luis Enrique told reporters after he was asked about television images showing Neymar complaining to his team mates on the bench. 'As a coach I understand that all the players want to be on the pitch,' he added. 'And the players must understand that I am the coach and I have to make decisions. Beyond that you can speculate and draw the conclusions you want.' Asked again about Neymar's behaviour later in the news conference, Luis Enrique drew laughter by taking the chance to wish his mother a happy birthday. Luis Suarez (centre) and Gerard Pique joke around during the session at the Parcs des Princes Stadium . Messi (centre) takes part in a drill and the forward will need to be in top form to beat the French champions . Barca and PSG have already met twice in the Champions League group stage this term, with the Ligue 1 side winning 3-2 in Paris and Barca's 3-1 success at the Nou Camp helping them finish as pool winners. Barca are in the last eight of Europe's elite club competition for a record eighth season in a row, while PSG are seeking a last-four place for the second time, having lost to AC Milan in 1994-95 after beating Barca in the quarter-finals. PSG's hopes of making the semi-finals have been hit by suspensions and injury, with Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Italy midfielder Marco Verratti banned and midfielder Thiago Motta out with a thigh injury. The three-time Ballon d'Or winner looks on as his Barcelona team-mates take part in a heading drill . Brazil centre back David Luiz has been sidelined with a hamstring problem, but has been included in the squad for Wednesday's match. 'Obviously they have some players missing, we cannot hide that, but if we remember the group game when Ibrahimovic wasn't playing they beat us,' Luis Enrique said. 'Then when Ibrahimovic was playing in Barcelona we were able to beat them. 'They are important players for them without doubt but they have a strong squad and for sure they will cause us problems.'

"Brendan Rodgers has insisted that Raheem Sterling will not be sold this summer, even if he fails to agree a new long-term contract at Anfield.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at five possible destinations for the England man. Raheem Sterling, pictured in training on Thursday, has attracted interest from a number of big clubs . ARSENAL .

But when push comes to shove, can they emerge victorious in what could turn out to be an auction? Sterling has rejected a contract worth £100,000-a-week and could look to force a move away from Liverpool . CHELSEA . The big question is how would Sterling fit into Jose Mourinho's plans given his wealth of attacking talent. But when the best players become available, the best clubs are always in the market. It is no different with the Blues. London will also be a major pull for Sterling. MANCHESTER CITY . City are always in the market for the best British talent as they try to keep up with homegrown quota regulations. Sterling will, perhaps, be the best available British player in the market this summer. Expect City to make their move early in the transfer window. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has insisted that the club will not sell Sterling this summer . MANCHESTER UNITED . Would Sterling do it? Would Liverpool sell to United? It would certainly a bold move should he join Liverpool's fiercest rivals. They certainly have the finances to make a deal happen. United are looking for superstars this summer. This would be a super transfer. BAYERN MUNICH . Pep Guardiola is understood to be a big fan of the 20-year-old. But would Sterling be up for playing abroad at such an early stage of his career? If he is, then expect Bayern to be in the running for his signature this summer.

"Whatever Isaiah Jay Brown goes on to accomplish in the game, it’s unlikely he’ll ever forget this weekend. On Friday, the 18-year-old played an integral part in Chelsea’s 4-0 demolition of Roma to earn a place in the UEFA Youth League final. Sometime that evening, he heard news that Jose Mourinho required his services. So back he went to London, sitting amongst the substitutes on the Loftus Road bench, the No 37 on his back, as the Blues took another big step towards the Premier League title.

Referee: Serdar Gozubuyuk (Holland) Afterwards, it was back to the airport and back to the shores of Lake Geneva. And there, on Monday afternoon, he pulled on the captain’s armband once more and scored two goals to inspire Chelsea’s academy side to European glory. There’s never a frown with Izzy Brown, it would seem. His excellent individual performance was one of many as the Blues dominated Shakhtar Donetsk to become the second name, after Barcelona, to be inscribed on the handsome Youth League trophy. The French winger Jeremie Boga was dangerous throughout and crafted the two goals - one for Dominic Solanke, the other for Brown - early in the second-half that finally rewarded Chelsea’s dominance. As for Solanke, his place on the scoresheet was just inevitable. The deadly England Under 18 striker has made this tournament his own, thriving on the European stage. His 47th-minute goal, a towering header from Boga’s perfect, dinked delivery from the left, took his season’s tally to 12. Solanke is, by some distance, the tournament’s top goalscorer and it’s greatest success this year. Brown, who was snatched away from West Brom's youtyh system, fired home to give Chelsea the lead .

Indeed, he might have had a hat-trick, somehow failing to connect with a drilled low Charly Musonda cross two yards out on the stroke of half-time and blazing over from point-blank range when Brown teed him up in the second period. Mourinho recognised his hot form with a senior debut against Maribor in the Champions League back in October. We now wait and wonder whether he’ll get any more first-team action, something that can be easily extended to all these players. Brown has also been involved with the first-team squad and his two goals here were both well-conceived and clinically finished. He gave Chelsea, who had racked up 33 goals in nine matches in reaching this point, the perfect start after just seven minutes. Showing no signs of fatigue after all that commuting, Brown thundered home Solanke’s low cross, culminating one of the many intricate passing moves Chelsea put together in the game. His second - Chelsea’s third - came on 55 minutes and killed the contest. Boga took his time in assessing the options in front of him and eventually found Brown inside the area. The captain swiveled and placed a fine left-footed shot into the far corner. Shakhtar drew level when Blues defender Andreas Christensen (centre) scored an own goal in the first-half .

They had also come from behind to beat Anderlecht 3-1 in Friday’s semi-final, that contest a stark contrast to the ease of Chelsea’s demolition of Roma. Having created little of note, they drew level late in the first-half when the unfortunate Chelsea centre-half Andreas Christensen diverted a dangerous Deny Arendaruk cross beyond his goalkeeper Bradley Collins. The Denmark under 21 defender looked crestfallen but the wrong was quickly righted by Chelsea’s rapier-sharp attack.

They are the defending Under 21 Premier League champions and will put their FA Youth Cup title on the line against Manchester City next week.

'But his wages and City's asking price might be a big obstacle.' Toure has scored seven goals and set up one more in 22 Premier League appearances this term for City. Inter are also working on new deals for their Argentina forward Mauro Icardi and Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic. Icardi is Inter's top scorer this season with 15 goals and is tied to the Nerazzurri for a further three seasons, while Kovacic, who is a reported target of Liverpool, is under contract with inter until June 2019. Inter striker Mauro Icardi is on the verge of signing a new contract with the club, according to Marco Fassone . Mateo Kovacic, pictured celebrating a goal against Cagliari, is also in talks over an extended deal . 'We are almost there with respect to Icardi's contract extension,' Fassone said. 'We want to keep him just as we want to keep Kovacic. 'We will evaluate with great care (their) eventual offers. 'It's clear that if we want to sign three players (this summer) we will need to evaluate those that will depart.' Inter's priority right now is to tie Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic to a long-term contract. Goalkeeper Samir Handanovic, pictured against Napoli, has been linked with Roma and Manchester United . The Slovenia international has been linked with Roma as well as Manchester United and becomes a free agent next season. 'Handanovic's renewal is an issue that we must resolve at once,' Fassone said. 'We need to understand what he wants. 'We cannot go into next season knowing that our goalkeeper's contract expires.' Inter are currently 10th in Serie A with 10 league games remaining.","Inter Milan are hoping to sign Manchester City's Yaya Toure this summer .

"A gay couple getting married this summer had their wedding plans featured on Hillary Clinton's announcement that she is joining the race for the White House. Democrat campaigners Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson, from Chicago, Illinois, claimed they were surprised to find out that their same-sex wedding plans were featured on Sunday's video announcing Clinton's 2016 bid. The pair were seen walking hand in hand in what quickly became one of the most widely viewed political clips of the year. Milrad's voice is heard in a voiceover saying: 'I’m getting married this summer to someone I really care about.' Scroll down for videos . Jared Milrad (pictured right) and his fiancé Nate Johnson, who are campaigning Democrats, were featured in Hillary Clinton's video announcing her 2016 White House bid . The couple, who are planning a summer wedding, were featured walking hand in hand during Clinton's video to announce her 2016 bid for the White House . 'We were both out shopping, working on wedding invitations,' Milrad said of finding out about their new-found fame. He said he was overjoyed to be part of the Clinton rollout - and part of a large-scale change in U.S. social attitudes. 'It shows how far we've come,' said Milrad, 31-year-old lawyer and social activist, pleased that public support for same-sex marriage rights has grown so far as to appear in a presidential campaign launch. Mr Johnson, 30, is a project manager for a health care consulting company. The couple will get married in July in a Chicago park bordering Lake Michigan then have their reception at a LGBT community center, The Washington Blade reported. The couple told The Blade that they would be making financial contributions to Clinton's campaign and would volunteer. Both have previously volunteered in presidential campaigns. Johnson supported Clinton in 2008 while Milrad worked for Obama in New Hampshire. The gay couple were only one in a diverse series of aspirational Americans featured in the Clinton ad, which casts a broad demographic net as she hunts for a winning coalition of voters. The video also featured Spanish-speaking brothers preparing to start a business, a mother seeking to return to the work force, an Asian-American college graduate and expectant African-American parents. 'Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion,' Clinton says on the video. 'So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote.' The vibrant clip, set to snappy music and featuring Clinton for less than half the video's length, is a dramatic departure from Clinton's drab announcement of seven years ago. The video which kicked off her former unsuccessful campaign showed Clinton on a couch, talking about ending the Iraq war, shrinking deficits and expanding affordable health care. Mr Milrad, who is the founder of social enterprise program the Civic Legal Corps, worked for Obama during the 2008 Democrat primaries in New Hampshire when the President was running against Clinton . Milrad, who is a lawyer and social campaigner, worked for Obama in New Hampshire during his 2008 White House bid . The couple pictured at the White House. They have been active campaigners in Democrat campaigns and plan to donate financially to Clinton's White House bid . It made no mention of same-sex unions. Barack Obama, the candidate who beat her to the White House, was personally opposed to gay marriage in 2008 and only recently converted to the cause. 'It's a sea change in progress that we see in our country,' Milrad said. Minutes after the Clinton announcement, Milrad took to Twitter to offer his endorsement -- and to invite Clinton to the upcoming Milrad-Johnson nuptials. 'We have not officially heard from Hillary,' admitted Johnson, a health consultant. 'We are going to extend an option of a plus-one for her. She'll probably want to bring someone.'","Democrat campaigners Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson, from Chicago, Illinois, had their summer wedding plans featured on Clinton's video .

"Tottenham target Kevin Wimmer will move to England this summer, according to Austria manager Marcel Koller. The Cologne defender, who is wanted by Spurs in a £4.4million deal, has impressed the boss of his national team as well as scouts at White Hart Lane this season. Earlier this week Wimmer confirmed that the two clubs were yet to agree a fee but that now appears to have changed after comments from Koller. Cologne's 22-year-old Austria international defender Kevin Wimmer is a £4.4 million target for Tottenham . He says it would be a 'dream' to join a top club like Spurs and would relish the challenge of English football . He said: 'He has played exactly the same as I've seen him do already in Cologne. On the ball he is very calm, not rushed. 'He switches in the summer to England. With his young age he still has potential to improve. He has it all.' Wimmer has admitted that it would be a 'dream' to join Mauricio Pochettino's side this summer. He told Laola TV: 'The two clubs have yet to agree because of the transfer fee. They are still negotiating. Wimmer, who has one senior international cap for Austria, would help Spurs bolster their defensive options . 'It would be a dream to move to a top club like Tottenham. For me, the transfer is a big step, a step with which I can develop myself. That's why I want to take the chance. 'I'm not someone who wants to stop developing. That is why England would be the next step. I'm playing in Germany. This is pretty much the best league in the world. 'The English Premier League is the only one that can match that. For me, the English league would be a great challenge. There I can develop because it's very demanding. I'm a fan of English football.'","Cologne defender Kevin Wimmer is a £4.4million target for Tottenham .

"Paul Scholes has told Raheem Sterling to stay at Liverpool and continue his development. Sterling said on Wednesday that he was not ready to sign a new £100,000-a-week deal at Liverpool and described links with Arsenal as ‘quite flattering’. Former Manchester United midfielder Scholes hailed Sterling as a good player but says he does not score enough goals and needs to focus on playing every week rather than move to a bigger club and not play. Raheem Sterling says he is not ready to sign a new deal at Liverpool . Paul Scholes has advised Sterling to stay at Liverpool and continue to develop . Sterling arrives for training at Liverpool's Melwood training ground ahead of this week's Arsenal clash . Scholes says Sterling should concentrate on playing every week for Liverpool . Writing in his Independent column, Scholes said: ‘When it comes to his future, my view is that Raheem Sterling should stay at Liverpool. They have elevated him from the junior sides and he has a manager who has built a team around him. He plays every week. What more do you need at that age? ‘Sterling is a good player. He can beat a man and on his day he looks impressive. But he doesn’t score enough goals, not yet anyway. ‘You have to be careful when you time a move to one of the biggest clubs. Occasionally, these young players do not realise what a good thing they are on to when they know that they will be playing every week.’ Liverpool are infuriated by Sterling's decision to give an interview to the BBC without even telling them and some members of the club's hierarchy are convinced that the England international and his representatives are simply preparing the way for a move this summer. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers shakes hands with Sterling as he leaves the pitch . Stirling says his refusal to sign a contract is not about money . Sterling says he wants to win trophies in his career . 'It's not about the money at all,' Sterling said. 'It's never been about money. I talk about winning trophies throughout my career. That's all I talk about. 'I don't talk about how many cars I'm going to drive, how many houses I've got. I just purely want to be the best I can be. 'I don't want to be perceived as a money-grabbing 20-year-old. 'I try to kill it off, but I don't think the public can see it that way. 'I think they just see it as this 20-year-old boy being greedy. 'I just want to take the time to think about what I've achieved in my career so far, where I need to go and what I need to do to get better as a player. 'Everyone's dream growing up is seeing themselves in an away kit somewhere in a sunny country. But, in reality, I'm happy to be playing for Liverpool and trying to win trophies.' 'If, at that point in time [last season], I was offered a contract, I most definitely would have signed straight away, probably for far less money than being said now.

The 19-year-old Spaniard is Real Madrid's first choice to fill the left side of their defence next season.

"She captured hearts across the nation as she realized her dream to play for Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team in Ohio and raised $1.5million - all while battling inoperable brain cancer. And one of the millions Lauren Hill touched was LeBron James, who posted an emotional farewell letter to the teenager via Twitter on Friday, just hours after she passed away from her rare tumor. In the letter, the basketball star, dubbed King James, praised the 19-year-old for the 'leadership', 'courage' and 'strength' she had shown while suffering from Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). James, 30, who had never actually met Lauren, wrote: 'Dear Lauren Hill, You are the true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership, etc etc! Your time spent on earth will never be forgotten.

The Cleveland Cavaliers player signed off the letter - which was posted to his Twitter page - 'Sincerely, LeBron James'. The letter has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times. Many users have deemed the tribute 'touching' and 'beautiful'. One told James - who competed against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night - that it 'was so sweet it brought me to tears'. Lauren, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had repeatedly defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. A touching tribute: James told Lauren not to have 'too much fun up there without all your family and friends' 'Tell my Grandma I said hello': He added that he had spoken 'plenty of times' about Lauren to his grandmother . #RIPLaurenHill: The Cleveland Cavaliers player signed off the letter - which was posted to his Twitter page - 'Sincerely, LeBron James' (pictured). The letter has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times . Instead, the Indiana native played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer she suffered from. But as her condition worsened, the teenager became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital. She passed away at the hospital on Friday morning. As news of her death became public, thousands of people across the country - both basketball fans and not - took to social media to express their sorrow at her death, and show support for her family. Only a year and a half ago, Lauren, whose cancer saw her rapidly gain weight, had been just another teenager preparing for college after deciding to play basketball for Mount St. Joseph. But a few weeks later, she started feeling dizzy while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found her tumor and she was told she had less than two years left. Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013, and right, in December 2014, after her treatment for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a rare childhood brain cancer which changed her appearance . Brave: Lauren, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December - months before she passed away . In September, doctors gave her the devastating news she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout player, Lauren's hopes of playing college basketball were put in jeopardy. However, the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition. On November 2, Lauren realized her dream of playing for the school. Incredibly, she scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . 'It's a dream come true,' Lauren told reporters at the time. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' At the game, Lauren said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game, USA Today reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Lauren played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, Lauren's family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV before her death. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter (left) and St Patrick's Day (right) from hospital in Cincinnati . Fighter: The NCAA moved Mount St. Joseph's first basketball game forward last November (pictured) so that Lauren could achieve her dream of playing for collegiate basketball. She scored the first and last baskets . The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday. 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' Lauren's coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.' No information about a memorial has yet been released, but Lawrenceburg Schools superintendent Karl Galey said on Twitter that schools will be prepared to assist staff and students with counseling. Heroic: Lauren, pictured left, smiles at Pat Summitt after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game in November last year. She went on to play four games for the school . Dear Lauren Hill, . You are the true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership, etc etc! Your time spent on earth will never be forgotten.

"A group of black attorneys have called for the second officer connected to the fatal shooting of South Carolina father Walter Scott to be arrested. National Bar Association officials said that Officer Clarence Habersham, 37, who was the second policeman to arrive at the dead man's body after shooter Michael Slager, should be fired and prosecuted for filing a false report. The call comes after Slager, who has been fired from the North Charleston police and charged with murder last week, is thought to have falsified reports on the circumstances that led to Scott's death. Warning: Graphic Content Below . Scroll down for video . The National Bar Association is calling for North Chareston officer Clarence Habersham, 37 (right) to be arrested for falsifying a report about the actions of  Michael Slager, 33 (left), during the death of Walter Scott . Habersham (right) was the second office to arrive at the body of Scott, 50, and did not report Slager's actions leading up to the shooting . Scott, 50, a Coast Guard veteran,  was pulled over for a broken tail light last Saturday by Slager, who shot him five times in the back as he ran away from the traffic stop. The father of four's death sparked nationwide debate about police brutality and bias against black people after a witness published video contradicting the police account of the event. Slager, 33, who is white, said that he felt 'threatened' by Scott, who is black, during a confrontation over his Taser, but video shows the civilian running away before being shot. Habersham, who approached the body after Slager went to go grab the Taser that fell, can be seen examining Scott. Slager then drops the Taser next to the dead body in the presence of Habersham. Habersham then used his radio to report that Scott had gunshot wounds to his chest, right side, and backside. However, the black officer gave a two-sentence supplemental report and said that he tried to render aid to the body, which no one in the video does. On April 4, 2015 I Officer Habersham responded to the empty Lot behind Mega Pawn in reference to the above incident. I (Habersham) attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and directing the best route for EMS and fire to take to get to the victim faster. Video released after Slager's account into the death shows Scott (left) running away from the traffic stop when he is shot. Mourners have placed flowers at a memorial to the veteran (right) over the past week . Slager said after the incident that he 'felt threatened' by Scott, though video shot by Feidin Santana contradicts his report . Officers in the video are seen walking around and checking the pulse of the body. Sergeant James Gann wrote in his report that he helped Habersham administer first aid and CPR.. Feidin Santana, who filmed a widely circulated video of the incident, said he did not any officers giving Scott CPR. The National Bar Association, the country's oldest group of black lawyers, said that Habersham 'deliberately left material facts out of his report' and left it 'incomplete'. The group said it was 'outraged' by the incident and that any other officer of the seven that quickly arrived on the scene should be indicted if they filed a false report. Police are interviewing all officers involved, a police source told CBS News. Chief Eddie Driggers said that he would not comment because the investigation is ongoing. POLICE VERSION . Police officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday. He said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light. He said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager. The officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement. According to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott. At that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said. He added that his actions were in line with procedure. Police then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser.' His department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim. WHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS . Slager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back. The footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body. Footage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him. It is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse. A black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid. They are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim. Relatives of Scott say their goodbyes to him on Saturday at a funeral that was was so widely attended that hundreds were left outside. Habersham was accused of excessive force by another black South Carolina resident, Sheldon Williams, 47, according to the Guardian. Williams, who has multiple criminal convictions, said that he was pinned to the ground, handcuffed and had his face stomped on during a 2011 arrest. He said he did not resist arrest . Scott was laid to rest today, his casket draped in an American flag and accompanied by his distraught mother. So many people came to the service that hundreds were left waiting outside. US senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman Jim Clyburn (D-SC), state senator Marlon Kimpson, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, and Elder James Johnson of the National Action Network all attended. Slager is being held without bail and faces punishments as serious as the death penalty if convicted. Judy Scott, the mother of Walter, leaves the funeral for her son in Charleston, South Carolina. The service was also attended by a number of the state's politcians .

"Robbie Williams has scaled back plans to revamp his multi-million pound home following a public spat with neighbour Jimmy Page. The 41-year-old star has ditched the proposal for a two-storey basement extension under the garden and glass studio at the top of his house. The Take That singer angered the veteran Led Zeppelin rocker with ambitious proposals for the 46-room mansion, which was previously owned by the late film director Michael Winner. Neighbours: The homes of Robbie Williams (left) and Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page (right). Williams has submitted fresh plans to extend his mansion having angered the veteran rocker with an earlier proposal . Williams responded by withdrawing the blueprints but has now returned with a fresh set of plans. After ditching the underground extension, the focus now is on the inside of the property, which he bought for £17.5million in 2013 and includes a swimming pool. Williams wants to lower some of the floors and knock down a number of the walls to create bigger rooms and doorways. One of the walls earmarked for demolition by the pop star is between his lounge and home cinema. The application reads: 'The proposed alterations have been considered in regard to a holistic programme of contemporary family living that will ensure the long term occupation and appropriate use of the place into the future.'

Somewhere to cool off: Williams' home included a swimming pool when he bought it. He wanted to build a new one in an underground extension but has since backtracked on the idea . Rocker Jimmy Page was upset that building work in Williams' garden (pictured) would cause disruption to the neighbourhood. He claimed the work could damage his property, built in the 1870s by Victorian architect . The plans have been submitted to Kensington and Chelsea Council and also include the demolition and rebuilding of the garage. Williams lives at the property with his wife, U.S. television actress Ayda Field, and their two children. Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, who lives next door house, hired a team of experts to help him rebuff the couple's original plans.

"Struggling Hamburg have appointed Bruno Labbadia as their new coach with immediate effect in a surprise decision with the former European champions anchored in last place with six matches left. Despite widespread speculation about a pending deal with former Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel, Hamburg said they had agreed on a 15-month contract with Labbadia, who had coached them in 2009-10. The coach's contract is also valid for the second division should Hamburg be relegated. He takes over from interim coach Peter Knaebel who replaced sacked Joe Zinnbauer in March and will now return to his post as sports director. Hamburg have appointed Bruno Labbadia as their new coach on a 15-month contract . 'We decided to take this step because we consider the coach question the most important,' said Hamburg CEO Dietmar Beiersdorfer in a statement. 'With Bruno Labbadia we now have a strong coach who is also experienced in relegation battles.' Beiersdorfer said the club had ended talks with Tuchel after an agreement could not be reached. Hamburg are the only club with a perfect Bundesliga record, having played every season in the top division since the league's creation in 1963. Labbadia returns to Hamburg for a second spell after coaching the club for one season in 2009-10 . The 49-year-old Labbadia, a former Hamburg player, has also coached Bayer Leverkusen and VfB Stuttgart among other. 'We have no time to waste,' Labbadia said.

"Newcastle boss John Carver accepts the pressure is on as his side head into their final six games with their top-flight status still not secured. The Magpies slipped to a fifth successive Barclays Premier League defeat at Liverpool on Monday, a result that did little to ease fears they could yet be sucked into relegation trouble. Newcastle remain in the relative safety of 13th place with 35 points but the sides below them have been eating into their cushion. They are nine points above the relegation zone but with some awkward-looking games in their run-in, including this weekend's home clash with Tottenham and matches against fellow battlers Leicester, West Brom and QPR. Newcastle boss John Carver insists his side have 'got six cup finals' left to play during the current campaign . Carver, pictured with Newcastle ace Moussa Sissoko, has won just two games since taking over the reins . Newcastle are just nine points above QPR . Carver said: 'We have got six cup finals. We need points. We have got four home games, two away, and it is important when we play those home games our fans are right behind us.' It looked like being a long night for Newcastle and their fans as Liverpool dominated the early proceedings at Anfield, with Raheem Sterling setting up their 2-0 win with a brilliant ninth-minute opener. Liverpool spurned several good chances to increase their lead and Newcastle rallied before the break and were controversially denied a penalty when referee Lee Mason surprisingly did not point to the spot after Dejan Lovren appeared to bring down Ayoze Perez. Perez also had a fine header superbly saved by Simon Mignolet but Liverpool secured victory through Joe Allen after 70 minutes, and Newcastle's misery was complete when Moussa Sissoko was shown a late red card. Carver at least felt his side had shown the right spirit after their recent derby loss to Sunderland. England winger Raheem Sterling scored in Liverpool's 2-0 win over Newcastle at Anfield on Monday night . He said: 'The pleasing thing from my point of view was our response. We have responded from that dreadful performance against Sunderland. Anything would have been better than what we saw against Sunderland. 'It is still not a win, but there are an awful lot of things that we can take into the final six games.' Carver, who has overseen just two wins in 14 games since taking over from Alan Pardew, is also fighting for his own future. Carver feels his side are getting a rough deal from referees, with the Perez penalty claim the latest example. He said: 'I think Liverpool fans understand the game like Newcastle fans do and the reaction of them told me it was a penalty. Even Brendan (Rodgers) said straight away it was a penalty. 'These guys have to do a job - I am not going to be critical in general - I am just talking about one big decision. Contracts and jobs and livelihoods are decided on decisions like that.

"John Carver will turn to Siem de Jong in a bid to save Newcastle’s sorry season. The £6million summer signing suffered a collapsed lung in February and it was initially feared he would miss the remainder of the campaign, especially as it was the second time he had fallen victim to the problem. De Jong has started just one Premier League game since arriving from Ajax and he was only days away from a return to action following a five-month layoff with a torn thigh muscle when he was diagnosed with the collapsed lung. Newcastle attacking midfielder Siem de Jong could return to action before the end of the current campaign . De Jong, pictured in training on April 9 with his team-mates, will feature for Newcastle's reserve side . However, the 26-year-old returned to training earlier this month and will now feature for United’s reserves when they entertain Derby County at St James’ Park on Wednesday night, as will England Under 19 winger Rolando Aarons. Sunday’s visit of Spurs will probably come too soon for De Jong and hamstring absentee Aarons – who has not played since November - but Carver will be desperately hoping to have them available for the final five matches of a season which is in danger of ending on a sour note. Newcastle have lost five on the spin and their head coach has admitted that he does not know where the next point is coming from. They have scored just once in eight hours and would be fighting relegation had it not been for a five-match winning run under Alan Pardew last autumn. Supporters are organising a boycott ahead of the televised clash with Spurs, where thousands are expected to stay away in protest at Mike Ashley’s running of the club.

"Miracle Godson drowned after jumping into deep waters at East Quarry near Wigan on Friday . A 13-year-old schoolboy who was tipped for rugby league stardom has drowned in a quarry after going for a swim on the hottest day of the year so far. Miracle Godson, from Marsh Green in Wigan, was reported missing on Friday afternoon after he jumped into deep waters at East Quarry in Appley Bridge near the town and failed to surface. Friends desperately tried to save him but his lifeless body was found by police divers at about 5pm that day. Lancashire Police say his death is not being treated as suspicious but an inquest will be held in due course. Bosses at Wigan St Judes Rugby League Club, where Miracle played for the junior side, said he had great future potential and scouts were monitoring his progress. The teenager's team paid their respects on Facebook after rugby league clubs across the region marked his death with a minute's silence ahead of games this weekend. It said: 'We at Wigan St Judes would like to show our appreciation to all teams across the country who held silences before their matches in respect to Miracle. 'The messages of condolence sent to us have been huge. And we cannot thank everybody enough. 'Our sport is tough, played by players who get into situations where confrontation happens on the field between players and supporters. 'This just shows how proud we are of our sport. But the rugby world really has shown how much we all stick together at times like this. 'Thank you all, the rugby league world and the rugby league family for your support at this very difficult time.' A tribute site to Miracle has also been set up on Facebook, alongside dozens of posts in his memory on Twitter. Friends tried to save him but his lifeless body was found in East Quarry, Appley Bridge, by police divers . Jules Staniford Russon posted on the wall: 'RIP Miracle, so so sad. Thinking of all your family x.' Sue Walls added: 'Truly saddened by this tragic news. May friends and family find strength and comfort in the difficult times ahead. X.'

"SPFL clubs are poised to do battle over a late Hibernian move to cash in on the Premiership play-offs. Currently second in the Championship, the Easter Road club stand to make £1million from anticipated sell-out home gates against Rangers and the 11th place club in the Premiership - currently Motherwell. Under recently passed SPFL rules, however, play-off sides must hand over 50 per cent of their play-off profits for distribution among lower league clubs within seven days. And, faced with the possible loss of substantial sums from two lucrative matches, Hibs chairman Rod Petrie has garnered support from Hearts and Motherwell for a resolution to slash the profits levied from play-off finalists from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. The issue will go to the vote at the SPFL AGM next Thursday, but faces opposition from the SPFL board who believe the move puts self-interest above those of all 42 clubs. Hibernian face a battle over potentially lucrative gate revenues with lower league clubs . On Tuesday, one senior club figure told Sportsmail on condition of anonymity, that the Hibs, Hearts and Motherwell proposal was ‘outrageous’. ‘The agreement two years ago was that the clubs from the bottom three divisions would get more of the money,’ Sportsmail was told. ‘As part of that overall package we agreed a levy on the play-offs. No one at that time anticipated you might have a Rangers-Hibs play-off final. ‘Now there is a move by people with vested interests to say “we might be doing ourselves out of a bit of money!”. And they are attempting to revisit it. ‘That’s potentially outrageous because all clubs voted for the restructuring on the basis of the overall package and you can’t suddenly decide later that because you are in the play-offs you are not happy with it.’ Hibernian declined to comment last night although the Easter Road club will argue that funding for lower league clubs will be unaffected by slashing the levy because of a new six-figure broadcast deal for the play-offs and the imposition by the SPFL of new minimum pricing policy of £15 and £10 for all six matches. Hibs would have to hand over 50 per cent of play-off gate revenues to lower league clubs under SPFL rules . Hibernian are believed to have had reservations over the 50 per cent levy before the redistribution package was passed and have now gathered backing to revisit the issue next Thursday from Motherwell – also likely to be involved in the play-offs – and city rivals Hearts. One Easter Road source told Sportsmail: ‘A rule change has been introduced by the SPFL stopping clubs allowing their season ticket holders into the play-off games for free. ‘They have also imposed a minimum price of £15 and £10 for the play-offs. ‘In addition there was no television money in place for the play-offs last year while this year they have secured six-figure revenues to go round the clubs. ‘Add in the fact the parachute payments to the Premiership clubs are fully funded by the SFA – not the SPFL – and people at Hibs take the view that to hand back 50 per cent of the money generated is excessive and unnecessary. The suggestion that it be reduced is not unreasonable. Hearts and Motherwell agree.’","Hibernian stand to make £1million from gate revenues in play-offs .

"Greg Rusedski has supported Aljaz Bedene's bid to overturn an International Tennis Federation ruling and become eligible to represent Great Britain in the Davis Cup. Slovenia-born Bedene secured a British passport last month but cannot currently represent his new nation in the competition having played twice for Slovenia in 2010 and 2011.

'At the moment when it comes to the Davis Cup he doesn't even factor into the discussion unless he gets the ITF to overturn their current ruling. 'But I think if the ITF do change their ruling and allow him to become available then it will be a good thing for the game in this country.' Bedene is currently ranked 99 in the world, making him British No 2 behind Andy Murray and ahead of James Ward, Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady. Rusedski has some experience of where Bedene is coming from after turning to Team GB from Canada .

Murray has already backed Bedene's switch of nationality, saying: 'I would hope that all the guys that are below him now will use it as motivation.' Bedene's case with the ITF is based on the fact that his citizenship was already pending when the governing body amended its own rules on the subject earlier this year. The 26-year-old could make his debut as a British player at the new AEGON Manchester Trophy, a grass-court Challenger event which starts on May 31.","Slovenian-born Aljaz Bedene secured a British passport last month .

'Come on, guys,' he moaned over the team radio after he was informed he'd missed out on pole. Hamilton was relaxed. Vettel was downcast, but said that the race may be a different story from qualifying. Hamilton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough. Rosberg, though, got closer to Hamilton than he has recently, perhaps heeding the advice of Niki Lauda, his team chairman, who told him via Sportsmail to ‘sort himself out’. McLaren will be towards the back of the grid. Jenson Button will start 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair’s breadth separated the two former champions. A naturally disappointed Button said: 'The car didn't feel bad so it's interesting when you find a good balance but the lap time is not there. We've made good improvements this weekend, but qualifying just wasn't for us. 'Hopefully we'll be racing the cars in front tomorrow, but we hoped to be competing with them in qualifying as well.' Sebastian Vettel qualified third but could threaten Hamilton's supremacy with the Ferrari stronger than Mercedes over a long run . Rosberg waves to the crowd after qualifying on the front row, but the German was clearly frustrated to have missed out on pole position . Hamilton's impressive lap on his first run on Q3 was enough to claim his third successive pole at the Chinese Grand Prix . Vettel starts ahead of Williams pair Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, with Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen down in sixth place as he struggled in Q3, with his best lap in Q2. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was seventh quickest ahead of the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, with Sauber pair Felipe Nasr and Marcus Ericsson performing superbly to claim ninth and 10th. Pastor Maldonado lines up 11th, missing out on a place in the top 10 by seven thousandths of a second, with Daniil Kvyat a surprisingly lowly and disappointing 12th in his Red Bull. Jenson Button out-qualified Fernando Alonso for the second consecutive race, but will only start 17th for McLaren . Fernando Alonso starts 18th in Shanghai and will have the Manor cars of Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi for company at the back of the grid . Toro Rosso rookies Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz Jr start 13th and 14th, with Sergio Perez 15th in a Force India that is off the pace as the team's financial issues means they will not have their new car on the grid until June. From the initial 18-minute session, Force India's Nico Hulkenberg led the list of departees, finishing three tenths of a second behind team -mate Perez. For the first time this season Manor had both cars taking part in qualifying, with both also comfortably finishing within the 107 per cent rule. Will Stevens, forced to sit out qualifying and the races in Australia and Malaysia due to issues, finally enjoyed a one-lap session. The 23-year-old Briton will start 19th, eight tenths of a second ahead of Roberto Merhi, albeit three seconds behind Alonso, underlining that whilst Manor are fighting, they still have a lot of work to do.","Lewis Hamilton claimed his third straight pole position of the season with a scintillating lap in Shanghai .

The world No 1 grabbed a towel from the ball boy (right)  who seemed startled by the loud confrontation . He said: 'It's probably been the best start to a season aside from 2011 that I had in my career, and I can't be more grateful for all the support I'm getting from you guys and I'm enjoying my time playing and competing and hopefully I brought a smile to your faces. 'Also I want to reflect on a bad moment that happened in the final against Andy when I lost the second set. I yelled to my camp and my box in frustration. 'I saw the replay. Unfortunately a ball boy was in the middle of it and I really, really feel sorry and regret that he was there. There was absolutely no intention whatsoever to hurt him or scare him in any kind of way. I sincerely hope he forgives me. I really apologise.' Djokovic then extended his apology to the boy's parents. 'I do care about children a lot right now and I look at it in a much different way,' he added. 'So I want to apologise to his parents for this situation as well. As a father I wouldn't wish that something like this happens to my son. The youngster was standing between Djokovic and his backroom team during the heated exchange . 'Again I sincerely hope you can forgive me and that we can move on. Unfortunately sometimes the emotions get the better of you. 'Also times as a professional athlete you learn how to control them and how to stay composed and mentally strong. But on a hot day like this when Andy was playing well and pushing all my buttons it wasn't easy.' Djokovic was feeling the pressure after Murray fought back from a first set tie-break loss to win the second set in the blazing heat of Key Biscayne, Florida. But the outburst seemed to take Djokovic to another level as he rolled Murray 6-0 in the third to claim his fifth Miami Open title.

"The omens are looking good. After taking the big race on the opening day of the Grand National festival, AP McCoy repeated the trick on Don Cossack to the delight of a huge Ladies’ day crowd. McCoy, who will ride hot favourite Shutthefrontdoor in the Crabbie’s Grand National on Saturday, struck on day one in the Doom Bar Aintree Hurdle with Jezki. If the trend continues, McCoy will be celebrating another victory in the biggest race of all. And if he wanted a further sign that the cards are falling in his favour, the last time he won the Melling Chase – on Alberta’s Run in 2010 – he followed up the next day in the Grand National on Don’t Push It. AP McCoy celebrates after winning the Melling Chase race at Aintree on Friday . McCoy rode Don Cossack to victory as he prepares for his final Grand National on Saturday . There may have been some fortune attached to Jezki’s victory as favourite Arctic Fire fell at the last flight when poised to challenge. Here, though, there was no luck involved. Don Cossack was mighty impressive in running away with The Grade One Betfred Melling Chase, prompting his trainer Gordon Elliot to talk of a challenge for the Cheltenham Gold Cup next year. This was one of the more straightforward successes in McCoy’s career, as once he took up the running three fences from home the result was never in doubt. Don Cossack ridden by McCoy (second left) leads the field on the way to victory at Aintree . McCoy jumps the final fence on Don Cossack as he rides to victory in the Melling Steeple Chase . In the end, there was a yawning 26-lengths back to second placed Cue Card, with John’s Spirit back in third. Elliott, who won the Grand National in 2007 with Silver Birch, said: ‘The horse is the apple of my eye. I was delighted to see him sent on when he was, as we know that he stays. It is nice having a winner for AP, as well. He is a genius. He has ridden a good few winners for me over the years.’ This has been a memorable meeting for Elliott, who saddled a first day double with Clarcam and Tagliatelle. He saddles Cause of Causes in the big one and hopes are high of a bold show. ‘When I won the National last time, I didn’t really appreciate it, ’said Elliott. ‘We are looking forward to tomorrow (Saturday).’","AP McCoy wins second feature race at Grand National festival .

"Lewis Hamilton's love of the Shanghai International Circuit continues to show no bounds as the reigning Formula One champion again claimed pole position for the race. Hamilton now has a record five poles to his name at the track, and three in succession, to take his tally to 41 overall in his career. The 30-year-old Briton ultimately finished just 0.042secs ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to give the team another front-row lock out. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, a surprise winner last time out in Malaysia, will start third, albeit down by nine tenths of a second on Hamilton. Now click here to read the full qualifying report. Host commentator . Thank you for joining us this morning and be sure to return tomorrow for our coverage of Sunday’s race. 1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Vettel; 4 Massa; 5 Bottas; 6 Raikkonen; 7 Ricciardo; 8 Grosjean; 9 Nasr; 10 Ericsson . ‘Oh come on, guys’, Rosberg exasperates after missing out on pole by 0.042secs. Hamilton fails to improve on his time, but it doesn’t matter as Rosberg can’t beat his lap. It is Hamilton’s pole. Back on track and all 10 drivers are out for their final runs and they’re all on fresh tyres. Here we go… . Meanwhile... Vettel crosses the line to go fourth fastest as he splits the Williams pair of Massa and Bottas. We’ve got four minutes to run. The Mercedes pair are so much quicker than the rest of the field here. Raikkonen is the first of the Ferrari drivers to post a time and he is the best part of two seconds slower than Hamilton on a used set of option tyres. And Hamilton crosses the line with a 1:35.782. Wow. What can Rosberg do? The Mercedes man is 0.280secs slower than his team-mate. Bottas is the first driver to post a competitive lap, and he crosses the start-finish line with a 1:37.903… but it is Hamilton up next. We’ll see two runs from each driver and Hamilton is the first of the Mercedes pair to take to the track. So, we’re already underway with the final session to determine the top 10… surely, Lewis Hamilton won’t be stopped in his quest for a third straight pole this year? So, surprisingly both Toro Rossos fail to make the top-10 shootout with Verstappen and Sainz to start 13th and 14th tomorrow. Hamilton remains the quickest man on the track. So, we’re in the last minute of Q2 and Massa, Ericsson, Nasr and Perez are facing the drop. Vettel crosses the line to go faster than Raikkonen,  but he is half-a-second off Hamilton’s mighty lap. Raikkonen goes third-fastest with a 1:37.1, but the Finn is seven tenths slower than Hamilton… what can Vettel do in the sister Ferrari? Neither Ferrari driver are yet to post a time, so the best of the rest behind the Mercedes pair is currently the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, 1.6 seconds slower than Hamilton. That really is a stunning time from the world champion. Rosberg follows Hamilton across the line, but he is three tenths slower than his Mercedes team-mate. The Briton really appears to be a class above his Mercedes team-mate this weekend. Valtteri Bottas leads the way until Hamilton posts a 1:36.423 with his first run of the afternoon on the soft-option tyre. He then reports that his seat was getting really warm on that lap; a problem he mentioned during practice this morning. The second session is underway in Shanghai to determine which drivers will make it through to the top-10 shootout. That’s quite a big shock to see McLaren on the penultimate row again. Button, Alonso and the team have been speaking with plenty of optimism this weekend, but they will start tomorrow’s race only 17th and 18th. So, the McLaren drivers do not make it out of Q1 and Button and Alonso will start on the penultimate row for tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix. But as I write that, Vettel goes fastest with a 1:37.502. Carlos Sainz, Pastor Maldonado, Romain Grosjean, Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi occupy the drop zone with a minute to go… . Raikkonen is back on track, on the softs, and it is the Finn’s turn to top the timesheets as he goes some two tenths faster than Bottas. Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa are both on the option tyres for their first timed runs of the afternoon. Bottas goes fastest with a 1:38.014 as Massa slots into third. Button, also on the soft compound, is faster than Alonso by four tenths, and he slots his McLaren into P7. The Briton comes over the radio to complain that the ‘rears are overheating’. Alonso is already donning the soft compound tyre. He comes across plenty of traffic on his fast lap, but still manages to go eighth… for now. So, with 10 minutes to go, Hamilton leads the way from Rosberg, Hulkenberg, Felipe Nasr, Vettel, Raikkonen and the ever-impressive Max Verstappen. Rosberg is the next driver to cross the line and he posts a lap of 1:38.496 which is some two tenths off his team-mate. Nico Hulkenberg, on the much faster softer compound tyre, pops his Force India into third. Here comes Hamilton, who looks at ease in his Mercedes, and the British driver is 1.6 seconds faster than Vettel. Ouch. Raikkonen crosses the line to post a 1:40.917, but he appeared to be struggling with plenty of understeer on that lap and Vettel crosses the line to go one second quicker than his Ferrari team-mate. Plenty of smoke as Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes is fired up, but there’s no problem with the world champion’s Silver Arrows as he takes to the circuit for Q1. Kimi Raikkonen meanwhile is the first big gun out on a hot lap… . Fernando Alonso failed to post a time in this morning's practice session, but the Spaniard is first out of the blocks as today's qualifying session gets underway. Security has been ramped up for this week’s race in China after a spectator managed to get on to the track during yesterday’s second practice session. The local man darted across the start-finish line before leaping over the pit wall and walking into the Ferrari garage. He is then alleged to have said: ‘I want a car. I’ve got a ticket.’ Rosberg has been challenged by Mercedes F1 chairman Niki Lauda to raise his game this weekend after being outclassed by Hamilton in both races so far this term. Here, the German is taking part in his traditional warm-up before hopping into his Mercedes for this afternoon’s qualifying session. That said, Mercedes, and Lewis Hamilton in particular, appear to be back to their ominous best in Shanghai. Hamilton has been fastest in all three practice sessions this weekend at a track where he has already won on three occasions and was the pole-sitter here in 2013 and again last year. The 30-year-old posted a time of one minute 37.615secs, finishing 0.226secs quicker than team-mate Rosberg. Fresh from his win in Sepang, Vettel was the best of the rest, albeit some seven tenths down on Hamilton’s best lap. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of today’s qualifying session for the Chinese Grand Prix. After Lewis Hamilton led Nico Rosberg home in a Mercedes one-two at the curtain raiser in Melbourne, we were told a year of domination from the Silver Arrows loomed. But how wrong they  were. Sebastian Vettel, in his Ferrari, upset the odds to roar to victory in Malaysia to blow the race for the championship back open and give Mercedes food-for-thought ahead of this week’s Chinese Grand Prix and for the remainder of the campaign.","Lewis Hamilton claimed his third straight pole position of the season .

"Daniel Ricciardo has called for a back-to-basics approach for Red Bull to forge a return to the front of the grid. Second best to Mercedes last season after a run of four successive championship triumphs, Red Bull have struggled at the start of this year. To rub salt into the wounds, Red Bull even found themselves trailing 'sister' team Toro Rosso at the last race in Malaysia. Daniel Ricciardo in action during practice for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix . The Australian driver has urged his Red Bull team to go back to basics after a troubled start to 2015 . The main gripe has centred on power-unit supplier Renault, with billionaire benefactor Dietrich Mateschitz suggesting this week he could pull his team out of the sport if matters fail to improve. Ahead of this weekend's grand prix in China, Ricciardo concedes Red Bull are exploring numerous avenues to correct the problems. The Australian managed to finish third quickest in practice, a second behind reigning champion Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes and four tenths of a second adrift of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. 1. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes 1:37.219 . 2. Kimi Raikkonen Ferrari 1:37.662 . 3. Daniel Ricciardo Red Bull - Renault 1:38.311 . 4. Sebastian Vettel Ferrari 1:38.339 . 5. Nico Rosberg Mercedes 1:38.399 . 6. Daniil Kvyat Red Bull - Renault 1:38.737 . 7. Valtteri Bottas Williams-Mercedes 1:38.850 . 8. Felipe Nasr Sauber - Ferrari 1:39.032 . 9. Romain Grosjean Lotus - Mercedes 1:39.142 . 10. Jenson Button  McLaren 1:39.275 . 11. Pastor Maldonado  Lotus - Mercedes 1:39.444 . 12. Fernando Alonso  McLaren 1:39.743 . 13. Marcus Ericsson Sauber - Ferrari 1:39.751 . 14. Max Verstappen Toro Rosso - Renault 1:39.894 . 15. Carlos Sainz Jr Toro Rosso - Renault 1:39.971 . 16. Nico Hulkenberg  Force India - Mercedes 1:40.151 . 17. Felipe Massa Williams-Mercedes 1:40.423 . 18. Sergio Perez Force India - Mercedes 1:40.868 . 19. Roberto Merhi  Marussia - Ferrari 1:42.973 . 20. Will Stevens  Marussia - Ferrari 1:44.564 . 'We are experimenting with a few things, but I think for now we have to go back to what we know, get our basics right,' said Ricciardo. 'We have done quite a bit. In Malaysia we had brake issues, a lot of overheating, so we have reverted back on a few things, even from last year which we knew was more efficient. 'Just because it's from last year it doesn't mean it's not better, so I guess we have taken a step back in that direction. The team has done quite a lot to rectify some issues and get us further up the grid.' Ricciardo has no doubt Renault are also pulling their weight, adding: 'From Melbourne to Malaysia they made a pretty massive step with driveability. 'We also have a few more software things this weekend, which should give things another pretty significant step on that side. 'I appreciate what everyone is doing to get us back towards the front, so fingers crossed it can be put together in the right way this weekend and if so we can get back into that top five.' Daniil Kvyat was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire . Team-mate Daniil Kvyat, however, was not so fortunate as the young Russian was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire. Christian Horner said: 'Something overheated within the rear hub assembly. As a result of that we lost pressure in the master cylinder halfway round the lap. 'We asked him to drive back slowly without using the brakes if at all possible, but unfortunately he had to brake at turn 14 and he had a very slow off. 'It's frustrating it's happened, but all the relevant pieces are intact so we can find out what the root cause was.' Despite suffering brake issues in Malaysia, Horner insists the issue there and the one experienced by Kvyat are 'totally unrelated'. Horner added: 'Today was a one-off and can be sorted for tomorrow.'","Red Bull have endured a difficult start to the new Formula One campaign .

"Jonathan Trott's first innings on his return to Test cricket for the first time in 17 months was brief and unsuccessful, as he was caught at first slip just three balls in. Trott last played a Test for his country in November 2013, when he withdrew from England's disastrous Ashes tour with a stress-related illness. But his much-anticipated return, this time as captain Alastair Cook's opening partner, was over almost before it had begun when he nicked Jerome Taylor to Darren Bravo. Jonathan Trott trudges off the field after being dismissed for a duck in his first game back in the Test team . Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Trott in the first over as England slumped to 1-1 after just five balls . Trott, usually a middle order batsman, had been preferred to Yorkshire's Adam Lyth, still to make his England debut, and moved up to the top of the order. But the gamble failed for the Warwickshire man, who has worked hard to prove he still has the quality to play Test cricket since his Ashes withdrawal the winter before last. The wicket left England one for one after just five balls after being put into bat by the West Indies in the first Test in Antigua. Trott was making his first Test appearance since his Ashes turmoil against Mitchell Johnson 18 months ago .","Jonathan Trott out after three balls, caught by Darren Bravo at slip .

"JIMMY’S TON UP . Jimmy Anderson was given a silver cap by Mike Atherton to mark his 100th Test. And well deserved it was, too. The list of fast bowling centurions is a short one and Anderson finds himself in good company with Courtney Walsh (132), Glenn McGrath (124), Chaminda Vaas (111), Shaun Pollock (108), Wasim Akram (104) and Makhaya Ntini (101). Jimmy Anderson was presented with a special silver cap after reaching 100 Test matches for England . RICHIE REMEMBERED . In a week when cricket lost one of its most revered voices, respectful tributes were paid before play began in Antigua. Both teams stood either side of the pitch for a minute’s silence in honour of the late, great Richie Benaud, who passed away last week. The players and officials also wore black armbands to show their respect. Both teams paid their respects to Richie Benaud before the start of play after he died last week . CANDID CAMERON . Dave Cameron — the West Indies Cricket Board president as opposed to the Prime Minister — said he needed to convince his team of the worth of playing for their country rather than playing for themselves. He told the BBC: ‘We have to help them understand that the team is the most important thing.’ HIGH AND KNIGHTY . There were some famous faces on show as the two ends of the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium were renamed in honour of Sir Curtly Ambrose and Sir Andy Roberts. Both were knighted at the ground in 2014 and Sir Curtly was joined by Sir Viv before play started. Though the power seems to have gone to Curtly’s head, judging by his unusual haircut... West Indies coach Sir Curtly Ambrose (far left) with Sir Viv Richards (second left) before the start of play . CASH BEFORE COUNTRY . What a shame that West Indies’ best batsman Chris Gayle chose to play in the IPL rather than for his country. Gayle hit 21 in a Royal Challengers Bangalore loss. It is a sad sign of the times that West Indies’ best would put a T20 competition before Test cricket. Money talks, of course, and Gayle has become very wealthy through Twenty20 cricket. It is certainly more lucrative than playing for West Indies. Chris Gayle (right) pictured playing for the Royal Challengers Bangalore during the 2012 edition of the IPL . NEW DESIGNS . Ian Bell and Joe Root could be seen wearing new headgear out in the middle.

"Jonathan Brownlee backed up his win in Auckland a fortnight ago by taking the Gold Coast Triathlon in the ITU World Series on Saturday. The Yorkshireman moved amongst the leaders on the swim, remained at the front during the cycle and then broke clear in the run, seeing off Mario Mola by 19 seconds with a winning time of 1:46:53. 'I think it's down to confidence,' he said of his victory. Jonathan Brownlee poses with his gold medal on the podium having won the Gold Coast ITU race . 'After the start of the season I had an awful race, I said I didn't want to make mistakes again. Today it started really well. I saw the four of us and thought lets be aggressive. 'On the run I knew they would take time out of me on the first lap, then I thought 'be steady, and if I run 30:30 it's going to take a great run for them to catch me', and fortunately they didn't.' World champion Javier Gomez took third. As a result Brownlee leads the rankings with 2,186 points from Gomez, who is 219 points behind. Brownlee broke clear of the field during the running section of the Gold Coast triathlon in Australia . In the women's race, Gwen Jorgensen racked up an eighth series victory in a row, leading a clean sweep of Americans on the podium with Sarah True second and Katie Zaferes third.

"He was the goalkeeper who only won his place in the side on the back of a teammate shipping an embarrassing eight, so when Costel Pantilimon conceded four goals inside 45 minutes he feared the worst – for himself and the club’s top-flight status. That was four weeks ago when Aston Villa ran riot at the Stadium of Light and Sunderland were booed from the field at half-time before thousands of fans streamed for the exits. Within 48 hours Gus Poyet had been sacked and Dick Advocaat was being installed. The Dutch boss celebrated his first home match with a 1-0 victory over Newcastle last weekend, a result which moved the Black Cats three points clear of the relegation zone ahead of this afternoon’s visit of Crystal Palace. Sunderland Goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon celebrates Jermain Defoe's goal against Newcastle United . Pantilimon kept his place despite pressure from Vito Mannone - the man who was dropped in the wake of October’s 8-0 defeat at Southampton – and the Romanian stopper admits there has been a definite mood change under Advocaat. ‘Before the new manager came, our confidence was not in a good way,’ said the 28-year-old, who was a Premier League winner with Manchester City in 2012 and again last season. ‘We were playing very badly, but now we have a new motivation. He’s brought the enjoyment back. ‘I never expected to play in a game like the 4-0 loss at home to Aston Villa. I was upset. You start to think about what you did wrong. The former Manchester City goalkeeper celebrates with teammate Santiago Vergini at the Stadium of Light . ‘We had to change something. It wasn’t easy. I thought about relegation after the Villa game. ‘I was asking myself, “What is happening?”. We couldn’t win games at home. Away from home we were taking points, but in front of our fans we were failing. 'It was strange and very frustrating. I didn’t know what we could do to be better.’ The answer, it appears, was Advocaat. ‘He has tried to bring us together as a group,’ explained Pantilimon, who has so far avoided one of Advocaat’s infamous fines for a lack of punctuality. ‘We all eat lunch together as a team. That should be normal. It’s a good idea, it creates a stronger group. It means we get to know each other better and other people’s situations. Pantilimon rolls the ball out to a defender as Sunderland beat Newcastle at the Stadium of Light . ‘On the pitch, he wants us to be aggressive all the time, but also keep the ball a lot more. ‘Before the derby he reminded us that not many people have the opportunity to play in a game like this. I think these words said everything, the motivation was at 100 per cent. ‘The atmosphere last week reminded me a lot of how it was after City won the league (in 2012). ‘It was incredible. My wife and my parents were there and they loved the game.’ Both of Pantilimon’s parents are deaf and the keeper uses sign language to communicate. Indeed, it was some advice from his father which set him on his way to a career between the posts. The Romanian shot-stopper celebrates a Sunderland win with his team-mates against Newcastle . ‘I was a striker when I started playing as a child because I liked scoring goals,’ said 6ft 8ins Pantilimon, who was raised in Bacau at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. ‘My father told me it was better to go in goal. He said I had the physical attributes to play there. ‘But I was not always so tall. I had a period between 14 and 16 when I grew so fast. ‘Thankfully, I didn’t like basketball so much. When I was about 15 I realised I could be a professional goalkeeper. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat enjoyed his first victory as manager in the derby game with Newcastle . ‘I was only 16 when I made my debut for a professional club. It was a third division club, but it was young to make my debut at that level. ‘I was always confident I could be a goalkeeper. I thought I could get right to the top, I’ve worked hard to be here and I don’t want to stop, I want to get better and better.’ Under Advocaat, things are certainly looking up, for Pantilimon and Sunderland.","Costel Pantilimon believes the good times have returned to the club .

"For Celtic, a slow-burning season has seen Ronny Deila’s side raise their game after a stuttering start and eventually rout their nearest rivals. Their steady emergence under the Norwegian has seen them swat aside second-placed Aberdeen 8-2 on aggregate over three matches and eradicate fourth-placed Dundee United 17-3 over the course of six games. Yet although the Parkhead side have in recent times looked like an increasingly irresistible force in the race for the treble, it has been left to third-placed Inverness Caley Thistle to enhance their credentials as the team most likely to represent a potential stumbling block on Ronny Deila’s march towards history. Leigh Griffiths (left) fired Celtic into an early lead in their encounter against Inverness . Griffiths runs over to celebrate his opening strike with the travelling Celtic supporters . Griffiths (right) celebrates his third minute goal with his Celtic team-mates, but the lead did not last long . In three games this season, there has been nothing between these two teams. In August, Celtic lost 1-0 at Tulloch Caledonian Stadium, before gaining revenge with a 1-0 win at Parkhead in November. On Saturday, Deila’s side were held to a draw by Caley Thistle. Yet while Celtic were surprisingly poor, the evidence from the weekend also suggests that Inverness possess a potent blend of passion and physicality which, more so than any other side in the country, seems to knock Deila’s men out of their stride. For goalkeeper Craig Gordon, Saturday’s 1-1 draw - which included a quick-fire goal from Leigh Griffiths and one in immediate response Edward Ofere - served as a warning shot against complacency in the quest for a rare domestic clean sweep. The Scotland goalkeeper believes his side will need to fight with every sinew when the two tribes renew hostilities in Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi final at Hampden if Celtic’s dream of winning a fourth treble is not to be shattered. ‘It’s a good little reminder that we are in for a big fight next week,’ said the Scotland international. ‘Inverness are a good team. They are big and physical - but they can also pass the ball. ‘They were up for it and they put us under a bit of pressure today. They’ve got a little bit of everything about them and, on any given day, they are more than capable of winning a game. ‘They pressed us high and they will try to do that again at Hampden. Hopefully we will learn from this and play better. But the one thing we know for sure is that we will be in for a battle next weekend.’ Edward Ofere (left) equalised for Inverness from close range a minute after Griffiths scoring .

But Gordon reckons the recently re-laid turf at Hampden will benefit Inverness just as much as the treble-chasers. ‘It will be a different venue on a different pitch but that won’t have any bearing,’ he said. ‘The pitch at Hampden will help us but it will be good for Inverness as well because they like to pass the ball about. ‘Both sides were aggressive today in trying to press, there was nothing nasty about it. Everyone was just trying to get one over their direct opponent ahead of the semi final and neither team wanted to lose ahead of next weekend. ‘We all know next weekend is a big one but we’ve also got a midweek league match (against Kilmarnock) at home on Wednesday night sandwiched right in the middle of these two Inverness games. ‘We need to keep picking up points. If we can win against Kilmarnock we can go into the semi-final high on confidence and looking to beat Inverness.’ If Celtic felt ill at ease on a poor pitch and blowing wind, it did not show as the elements played a part in the opening goal after just 135 seconds. The wind held up Scott Brown’s long ball and Griffiths set himself up before blasting past Dean Brill from 25 yards for a terrific goal. Inverness goalkeeper Dean Brill was substituted off injured after 20 minutes against Celtic . Stuart Armstrong of Celtic tackles Ryan Christie of Inverness in Saturday's early Scottish Premiership match . Inverness were level almost straight away, however, when David Raven’s shanked shot was directed goalwards by Ryan Christie. Belgian defender Jason Denayer cleared the ball off the line but only as far as Nigeria forward Ofere, who was there to ram home his second goal for Caley Thistle since joining the club in January. It had been a breathtaking opening five minutes but the next incident of note was a horror show for Brill as the enthusiastic Gary Mackay-Steven chased down a loose ball and accidentally caught the Caley Thistle keeper, who collapsed to the deck in agony. As the keeper was treated by medics on the park, Mackay-Steven kept checking on the welfare of his stricken opponent. Jeered for his role in the incident, Mackay-Steven seemed spooked afterwards and fell out of the game, before being substituted by Kris Commons just after the hour mark. There was precious little else to talk about in the remainder of the match, apart from some decent saves by Brill’s replacement Ryan Esson from Efe Ambrose and Denayer - while Celtic captain Scott Brown was booked for ‘simulation’ after colliding with Raven in the box. Afterwards, Deila backed his man, saying Brown was ‘the last man in the world anyone can accuse of diving.’ Deila added: ‘He is a tough guy. It’s not a big issue.’ Keeper Gordon, meanwhile, tried to remain philosophical over two lost points in a title race which has been going Celtic’s way for quite some time. ‘I think a point was probably fair today. It’s always tough here and you always get a battle,’ he said. ‘That’s pretty much what it was like as the game never really settled down or had any real pattern to it. ‘We couldn’t impose ourselves and do what we wanted to do. The conditions were difficult, but it was the same for them. Both teams created a few opportunities but not too many and a draw was fair. We will need to be better next Sunday if we are to get a result.’","Leigh Griffiths gave Celtic a third minute lead which lasted only 60 seconds .

"Ian Bell rescued England from a nightmare start with a century in the first Test against West Indies that was pay back time for being dropped during his last Caribbean series. After his classy 143 had steered England to 341 for five, after they had been 34 for three, Bell said that thoughts of him losing his place in 2009 was a big motivating factor. Bell said: 'It's been at the back of my mind for some time that I got dropped the last time I was here for a Test series. So I wanted to make this one count and it was very satisfying to do so. I deserved to be dropped at the time and I did a lot of hard yards to get back in.' Ian Bell scored 143 on the first day of the first Test against West Indies in Antigua on Monday . The 33-year-old kisses the England badge on his helmet after his 22nd Test match century . And Bell rates his hundred one of the best of his 22 – only Alastair Cook (25), out for another low score, and Kevin Pietersen (23) have scored more. Bell shared century partnerships of 177 with Joe Root, who made 83 and another one of 130 with Ben Stokes who is 71 not out. 'It has to be right up there,' said Bell . It doesn't get much better. The partnership with Joe Root was just what we needed. But the West Indies bowled very well for the first two hours. And Ben Stokes made it a brilliant finish to the day.' Bell was dropped from the side on his last visit to the Caribbean in 2009 . Bell put on 177 for the fourth wicket with Joe Root and added 130 for the fifth wicket with Ben Stokes . ' It was my day today, but hopefully it will be someone else's day in the next innings. 'For me, it was nice - coming here in 2009, this was where I got dropped after our shemozzle in Jamaica, so I was determined to come out and play as well as I could. 'It was nice to come back and put things right.' Bell raises his bat after being dismissed for 143 in the evening session on day one in Antigua . Kemar Roach runs away to celebrate bowling Alastair Cook out for 11 on the first morning of the Test . Cook, who hasn't added to his record haul of 25 centuries since May 2013, was bowled by Kemar Roach for 11 falling again to a good length ball outside off stump. Roach said: 'Cook has a weakness there, everyone knows it. We let them get away a bit, but Bell batted very well.' The other two England disappointments were a nervous-looking Jonathan Trott who lasted just three deliveries on his return from 'situational anxiety', and Gary Ballance, who also fell to a poor shot.","Ian Bell hit 143 on the opening day of the first Test in Antigua .

"Celtic midfielder Stuart Armstrong has backed under-fire Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara to turn around his troubled season at Tannadice. McNamara has faced a furious fan backlash in the past week amid a woeful run of results allied to the revelation that he receives a cut of transfer fees for United players sales. Since selling prize assets Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven to Celtic for £2million on transfer deadline day, United have won just once, in a Scottish Cup tie at Stranraer. Celtic midfielder Stuart Armstrong has backed under-fire Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara . McNamara has faced a furious fan backlash in the past week amid a woeful run of results . After 10 games without a win, the heat was turned up on McNamara on Wednesday night when United lost 3-1 at Dens Park – their first derby defeat to Dundee since November 2004. However, as McNamara comes under increasing pressure from United fans, some of whom believe his position is untenable, Armstrong yesterday backed his old boss to ride out the most testing period of his managerial career. ‘Jackie McNamara is a good guy. He was always really nice to me when I was at United - and he is capable of turning it around,’ said the 23-year-old. Celtic unveil former Dundee Utd teammates Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven following their exit . ‘Yes, United are having woes just now. They are on a bad run of form, and the injuries aren’t really helping either. But these things happen in football. I am sure Jackie McNamara and United will turn it around – it’s just a matter of time.’ Asked yesterday if this spell was the toughest test so far of his managerial career, McNamara said: ‘Not really. We went through a spell last year but it’s things I’ll learn from. I am learning so it’s been good in that sense. ‘I’ve learned different things, reasons for things and different scenarios recently. I think that will stand me in good stead.’ Mackay-Steven (right) celebrates his goal with former Dundee United teammate John Rankin . Ex-United defender Mark Wilson, who also left Tannadice in January, insists the root of the current crisis at United has been their losing streak - not the manager’s controversial bonus scheme. United face Hamilton today, who have not won in 12 matches, and Wilson believes ‘bruised figure’ McNamara can win back the fans if he can restore his team to winning ways. ‘The bonus row doesn’t sit well with the fans,’ conceded Wilson. ‘But that’s purely because the team is losing. If the team was winning it would all be brushed under the carpet. ‘Does the manager look a bruised figure right now? Yes, but you can see why! He’ s built a successful attacking team and his players are getting ripped away. Former Dundee United ace Armstrong celebrates with Mackay-Steven after scoring for Celtic . 'You don’t know whether the players had clauses, or whether it’s been a decision made at the top of the club, but if you took Armstrong and Mackay Steven out of any team it would leave a massive hole. 'Take away Andrew Robertson and Ryan Gauld, who were sold last summer, that’s four mainstays of last year’s team now gone. ‘Those are big shoes to fill, and I’m sure the likes of Aidan Connolly and Blair Spitall, if given time, will do that. Jackie has shown he can go out and buy and rear genuine stars. I believe there is still enough quality there for United to grind out results and start climbing up the league.’","Stuart Armstrong has backed Jackie McNamara to come good again .

"Roberto Martinez will hold talks with Kevin Mirallas over his future at the end of the season as he stated his ambition to keep Aaron Lennon. Mirallas was one of Everton’s top performers in the first half of the campaign but his form has tailed off following a number of hamstring injuries and he has wanted by Tottenham during the January transfer window. It was mooted at one point that Mirallas and Lennon could be part of a swap deal but Lennon arrived at Goodison Park on loan and has made a big impression on his manager; it would cost £6million to make his signing permanent when the window re-opens. Roberto Martinez will hold talks with Kevin Mirallas and admits he wants to keep loanee Aaron Lenon . Mirallas has made no secret of his ambition to play in the Champions League and Martinez, whose side face Swansea on Saturday, will speak to him after the final game about what his intentions are moving forward. ‘Every player needs to be pleased and happy with that, so in the summer we'll sit down and assess what has been,’ said Martinez. ‘For that reason the next seven games are vital and will give you a much clearer picture of what you do in the summer. Belgian attacker Mirallas was one of Everton’s top performers in the first half of the campaign . ‘I know there have been a couple of times he's had quotes translated from interviews. I don't think anything he has said is disrespectful or out of the norm. The way I see it he's one of those players who loves playing football and he hasn't got any other motivation. ‘He still has a two year contract. If he were out of contract, I would be worried, but all I want is for him to be fully recovered.’ Mirallas has made no secret of his ambition to play in the Champions League . Lennon has caught the eye in recent weeks and Martinez wants him to maintain his impressive form all the way through until the end of May. ‘He’s been a really impressive footballer,’ said Martinez. ‘The way he’s engaged with the other players has been quite impressive. I think he’s brought know-how and experience but also that freshness of wanting to show what he can do. ‘The next seven games will be very important to see if he can carry on enjoying his football and then like any loan situation it’s a three way conversation that, first of all, the player needs to see that experience as a positive one and then we’ll see what the parent club wants to do. ‘But it’s not a decision we need to make now. The next seven games is an eternity in football.’ Lennon is all smiles as Everton train ahead of their weekend fixture against Swansea City .

"Two dropped points won’t cause too much damage to Celtic’s title defence — but this draw will have offered encouragement to Inverness Caledonian Thistle ahead of next weekend’s Scottish Cup semi-final against the champions. While Celtic have relentlessly marched towards the title, the shine has come off Caley’s season in recent weeks, with manager John Hughes struggling to find a solution to the problem posed by the sale of top scorer Billy McKay to Wigan in January. Nigerian Edward Ofere has been recruited as a replacement and, although he does not appear to have the same natural predatory instincts as the Northern Irish international, he did pop up in the right place to equalise Leigh Griffiths’ early goal. Leigh Griffiths (left) fired Celtic into an early lead in their encounter against Inverness . Griffiths runs over to celebrate his opening strike with the travelling Celtic supporters . Griffiths (right) celebrates his third minute goal with his Celtic team-mates, but the lead did not last long . A further sign of the Highlanders’ fortitude came with the way in which they absorbed the loss of goalkeeper Dean Brill to a nasty knee injury but, in truth, neither side was able to play their favoured passing game thanks to the combination of a bobbly pitch and a strong wind. Celtic last travelled here during their troubled and ultimately unsuccessful bid to qualify for the Champions League group stages, with manager Ronny Deila making 10 changes to the team in the midst of a two-legged tie with Slovenian champions Maribor. Names like (Filip) Twardzik, (Teemu) Pukki and (Dylan) McGeouch featured on the team-sheet that day, with teenage Irish defender Eoghan O’Connell having the dubious honour of match-winner, his own goal gifting Inverness Caley their 1-0 victory. With Celtic eager to wrap up the title as quickly as possible, a victory was the priority this time and there were three changes to the team that beat Partick Thistle in midweek, Efe Ambrose and Scott Brown joining Griffiths in the starting line-up. Deila has taken to rotating his strikers of late and Griffiths immediately staked his claim with a clinical piece of forward play which had shades of the sort of goal he regularly scored for Hibs en route to picking up the Player of the Year title with the Easter Road club a couple of years ago. Edward Ofere (left) equalised for Inverness from close range a minute after Griffiths scoring . Ofere (left) wheels away in celebration after swiftly levelling the score for Inverness against Celtic . Brown, restored to the team after suspension — and booked again on Saturday — offered assistance by launching a long pass into the wind. The stiff breeze coming off the Moray Firth was enough to give Griffiths the chance to beat Gary Warren in a race for the ball. By the time the defender had got square, Griffiths had worked the ball onto his left foot and drilled an emphatic finish into the bottom corner of the net from 20 yards. With their team on such a poor run and struggling to score goals, the locals cringed — but Inverness rallied and produced an impressive response. Ofere may have shown little to suggest he can offset the loss of McKay’s goals but he is a powerful specimen and this, clearly, was his type of occasion. Before scoring, he had already given Jason Denayer a couple of bumps and he was there to punish the Belgian for the goal. Denayer did all he could to prevent the ball crossing the line when he blocked Ryan Christie’s net-bound effort but Ofere was there to jab home the finish from close range. Few teams have the physicality to match Celtic but Ofere typifies the muscular streak that runs through Hughes’ team, with Warren, Josh Meekings, Warren, Greg Tansey and Ross Draper all quite happy to mix it with the champions. Inverness goalkeeper Dean Brill was substituted off injured after 20 minutes against Celtic . Stuart Armstrong of Celtic tackles Ryan Christie of Inverness in Saturday's early Scottish Premiership match . In such circumstances, Celtic turn to Brown, and the captain stepped up to the plate, breaking up play and showing a willingness to carry the ball forward from deep. He was the most impressive performer afield, yet his game was not without controversy as he picked up a yellow card for tumbling when tackled by David Raven, a harsh sanction from referee Craig Thomson, who adjudged the contact insufficient to award a penalty. The Highland team had to overcome a more serious setback, however, when goalkeeper Brill went down in obvious discomfort after kicking clear as Gary Mackay-Steven moved in. There seemed no ill-intent in the Celtic winger’s challenge but Brill required five minutes of treatment before being stretchered off and replaced by Ryan Esson. To his credit, the substitute produced impressive saves either side of half-time to tip over headers from Ambrose and Denayer. Caley dropped deeper as the game wore on, with Deila introducing Kris Commons, Adam Matthews and John Guidetti in a bid to force the issue. Even so, it was Inverness who came on strongly at the end. Raven and Tansey flashed shots over, although ultimately there was nothing to test the capabilities of Craig Gordon in goal.","Leigh Griffiths gave Celtic a third minute lead which lasted only 60 seconds .

"Rangers kept the pressure on Hibernian in the race for second spot in the Championship with a comfortable 4-0 win over Raith Rovers. Hibs had secured a win over Hearts in the Edinburgh derby in the earlier kick-off and the Light Blues knew they had to respond. They bounced back from Thursday's defeat by Queen of the South, with Nicky Clark and Haris Vuckic claiming a goal apiece and Nicky Law grabbing a double. Nicky Clark celebrates after putting Rangers 1-0 up against Raith Rovers on Sunday . Clark in the air as he heads the ball towards goal to give the hosts the lead at Ibrox . Rangers manager Stuart McCall applauds the home fans after the full-time whistle . The win means Rangers and Hibs remain level on 61 points, albeit the Leith side have the better goal difference. Stuart McCall had suffered his first defeat as Rangers manager against Queens last week. So it was no real surprise to see him make three changes for the visit of Raith. Goalkeeper Cammy Bell was back between the sticks and Dean Shiels and Robbie Crawford were also added to the side. The Light Blues enjoyed the best possible start to the game when they surged into the lead after just six minutes. Clark found himself in plenty of space to connect with Law's corner and bullet a header home from 10 yards. Law then carved out a chance of his own but his shot from just inside the box was weak and easily held by Kevin Cuthbert. But the goalkeeper had no chance when Gers claimed their second of the day after 27 minutes. Vuckic cut inside from the right before unleashing a powerful drive into the bottom corner to claim his seventh Rangers goal.

Raith could have pulled a goal back moments later but a well-struck free-kick from Ryan Conroy on the edge of the box was blocked by Bell. The visitors fired out another warning to Rangers shortly after the restart. Lewis Vaughan tried his luck with a snap-shot that fell inches past the upright as Raith tried to haul themselves back into the game. At the other end, the hosts passed up a decent chance to all but secure the three points. Vuckic released Crawford and he tried to tee up the shot for Law but he failed to connect in front of goal and the chance was lost. However Law was celebrating when he added his name to the scoresheet after 72 minutes, putting the game beyond Raith. Law's first attempt crashed off the crossbar but the ball fell kindly to his feet and he had the net bulging with the rebound from eight yards. Tom Walsh then saw a terrific volley saved well by the goalkeeper, before Law completed his double when he curled home from the edge of the box with two minutes to go.

"Stuart McCall  watched Rangers bounce back to winning ways before warning his players they must show further improvement in the push for promotion. The Ibrox side recovered from their defeat against Queen of the South as two goals from Nicky Law and one each from Nicky Clark and Haris Vuckic swamped Raith Rovers in a 4-0 victory. McCall, though, wasn’t happy with some of lax moments within their performance and insisted that better will be needed for Wednesday night’s trip to face a Livingston side fighting for survival. Nicky Law celebrates after putting his side 3-0 up as Rangers cruised to victory over Raith . That meeting with the Championship’s bottom club is Rangers’ game in hand over Hibernian, providing the chance to push three points clear in the battle for second place. ‘It was okay,’ reflected McCall on the victory over Rovers, who are locked in mid-table safety. ‘There were some nice goals, although we were sloppy at times. ‘For a little period in the second-half of 20 minutes, we went through the motions and we can’t afford to do that. ‘It was pleasing in a few senses with some nice goals, some decent football and a clean sheet. ‘But we certainly know that Wednesday night will be a different challenge. I was at the Alloa versus Dumbarton game on Saturday and you could sense that Alloa had everything to play for and Dumbarton nothing bar pride, obviously. ‘I thought the game today might pan out as it did, but Wednesday will be different with Livingston flying in terms of their recent results. ‘There is no singing and dancing today. We have done OK. I still think that we’ll need to be better and we can be better,’ said McCall. Stuart McCall has warned Rangers to be on their guard against Livingston in midweek . The pick of the Rangers goals again came from Vuckic, who has scored in each of his last five Ibrox appearances. The Newcastle United loanee has netted seven times in 12 Rangers outings overall. ‘We tried to swap it around by playing a diamond and by getting Haris into more space,’ added McCall, who expects another of the loanees, Shane Ferguson, to begin training with Rangers today. ‘But he still tends to head for the right-hand side, which is his favourite. ‘Every time he cuts in onto his left, you expect the net to bulge. ‘We had good footballers in there with him, Nicky Law, Dean Shiels and Andrew Murdoch, who I thought was terrific again. ‘I said from day one that Haris has got fantastic ability. ‘Obviously, he has got fitter having played more games now, and his match fitness is now looking strong at the end of games where he was flagging after 50 or 60 minutes earlier. ‘That’s just having more time on the park. He is important to us and he is a goal threat.’ Nicky Clark (left) heads it home to give Rangers an early lead . Raith Rovers manager Grant Murray feels Rangers have improved under McCall, but he also believes that whichever Championship side comes through the play-offs will face a difficult task to clear the final promotion hurdle. ‘They still have to go and play a Premier League team and there is a good chance that that team will have a winning mentality,’ said Murray. ‘People are talking about Ross County or Motherwell - well it won’t be an easy task going to these kind of places. ‘I think everyone is talking about how Rangers have picked up now and they look like a strong team who will finish second. ‘Hibs have had a fantastic season, too, in terms of the attacking football they play, but I think Queen of the South are also keeping themselves in there. ‘We knew Rangers would come at us after losing on Thursday and we knew it would be difficult. It is difficult coming to places like this and you have to stand up and have the right mentality. But going a goal down so early put us on the back foot.’","Rangers beat Raith 4-0 but McCall is aware of tough test Livingston will provide in midweek .

"John Carver has labelled Moussa Sissoko's reckless lunge on Lucas as 'indefensible' as the Newcastle boss refused to make excuses for his captain. The midfielder was sent off for two bookings in the 2-0 defeat at Liverpool Sunday night, but he could've seen a straight red after he caught Lucas on the ankle. The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle.

I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.'

Carver did see reason for some optimism, feeling that his side's performance was much improved from their derby loss to Sunderland last time out. Sissoko is given his marching orders by referee Lee Mason after picking up two yellow cards . He said: 'I thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative, nervous after our performance against Sunderland. It was a bad goal to concede. 'After that we grew into the game. It is easy to crumble at Anfield but we didn't. One or two guys rolled their sleeves up. 'I think we got a response. We didn't get a result but I saw enough.

"It was the high point of their young careers. As silver confetti rained down, the Chelsea players took their turn to lift the UEFA Youth League trophy towards the cloudless Swiss sky. Each was cheered to the echo by their team-mates and the crowd. Their 3-2 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk in Nyon meant another piece of silverware for the ever-expanding cabinet at Chelsea’s academy. It will be seen there as affirmation of the superiority of the Stamford Bridge production line.

Will Izzy Brown, given a tantalising taste of first-team involvement when named on the bench for Sunday’s match at QPR before flying back to captain the team and score twice here, be absorbed into Mourinho’s forward line? Brown, who was snatched away from West Brom's youtyh system, fired home to give Chelsea the lead . Brown races off to celebrate his opening strike closely followed by his Chelsea team-mates . Solanke, Brown and the elegant central midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek have all been involved in the first-team squad, grabbing minutes here and there, but we all wait and wonder whether they will become regulars. Coach Adi Viveash struck an optimistic tone: ‘Do I feel they’re getting closer? Yes. Do I feel players from this group will come through? Yes. I’m confident of that. ‘You can’t have a team that’s won as much as it has and have the different range of qualities and strengths as we have and not feel confident some will come through. ‘Ruben, Dominic and Andreas (Christensen) have got minutes this season but it is all right getting minutes, they’ve got to get to the next stage.’ And it is in getting players to that next stage that Chelsea, so far at least, have struggled. While many of their academy products have gained minutes here and there, you have to go back to John Terry to find a bona fide first-teamer who has come through the ranks.

Take a look at the side that played in the 2010 FA Youth Cup triumph over Aston Villa. Centre back Jeffrey Bruma made nine senior appearances for Chelsea before spending time on loan at Leicester City and Hamburg. He was sold to PSV in 2013. Josh McEachran, the midfielder tipped as England’s next great hope, is currently at Vitesse in Holland, his fifth loan spell in three years. Now 22, his chance at Chelsea has long passed.

"Michael Vaughan has re-affirmed his interest in taking on the newly created role of director of England cricket - but only if he feels he can make a difference. A new post has been opened after Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket on Wednesday, with the job title also scrapped. Instead ECB chief executive Tom Harrison is keen to have Downton's replacement focus solely on performances, rather than administration duties, which has brought a number of former England captains into the fray. Michael Vaughan has re-affirmed his interest in taking on the newly created role of director of England cricket . Ashes 2005 winning skipper Vaughan is among the early frontrunners for the new role with the ECB . Ashes 2005 winning skipper Vaughan is among the early frontrunners although the former Yorkshire batsman admitted in his column with the Daily Telegraph he would need to know more about the role before committing. Vaughan, who since retirement has been a pundit and commentator for numerous media outlets, said: 'It will take honesty and unity to make a change. In (incoming ECB chairman) Colin Graves and Tom Harrison we have a chance to change English cricket and admit our problems. 'Let us finally do it. Stop looking at what your own county needs and ask what is best for English cricket moving forward and what is right for the England team to sustain a proper period of success. Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket . 'For the first time since retiring six years ago I am open to a conversation with the ECB. I am passionate about English cricket. I love the game and I always want England to move forward and be successful. 'I have a vision for the game and I think I will be one of many ex-players who will be more than willing to talk to the ECB to see what exactly the role is and how much influence it will wield over the future structure of our game. 'The brief has to be wider and more powerful than Paul's to have any real impact on England.'","Michael Vaughan wants to get new role of director of England cricket .

"English cricket's new broom swept dramatically through the national team on Wednesday night when Paul Downton paid the price for their woeful World Cup by being sacked as managing director. The move came a day ahead of an ECB board meeting that was meant to discuss the future of a figure who has endured a traumatic time since replacing Hugh Morris in the aftermath of the Ashes whitewash. With more sackings inevitable, Sportsmail asks: Who's next? Alastair Cook . Downton was a supporter of Cook as Test captain but was persuaded to sack him as one-day captain three weeks before the disastrous World Cup campaign. The new ‘Director of England cricket’ might think Cook needs to go back to scoring runs at the top of the order after failing to convince as a tactician. Verdict: Vulnerable. Alastair Cook was sacked as one-day captain three weeks before the disastrous World Cup campaign . Peter Moores . An atrocious World Cup heaped even more pressure on the coach, whose reappointment last year by Downton has been mitigated only by last summer’s Test series win against India. Described as ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’ by Downton, Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been. Verdict: Vulnerable. Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . Kevin Pietersen . It is almost inconceivable that barely six months after publishing one of the most vitriolic books in the history of sport, this high-maintenance player could be on the brink of a return. But Downton’s removal, and Giles Clarke’s departure, means the path is now clear for Pietersen if he scores runs for Surrey. Verdict: Return possible. Pietersen has rejoined Surrey in the hope of earning a place in the Ashes squad for England this summer . James Whitaker . The chairman of selectors and former Leicestershire captain has been involved in one of the grimmest periods in English cricket. Selections have been difficult to fathom at times and a series of well-publicised clangers have alienated the selector from players, spectators and media. Verdict: Sure to follow Downton out the door .

"Chelsea will try to add another trophy to their ever-expanding cabinet when the Under 19 team take on Shakhtar Donetsk in the final of the UEFA Youth League on Monday afternoon. Adi Viveash's team will start as favourites in Nyon, Switzerland after their resounding 4-0 win over Roma in the semi-finals on Friday, a result which continued their free-scoring form in this competition. Ahead of the final, we bring you everything you need to know. Chelsea striker Dominic Solanke starred in his side's emphatic 4-0 semi-final win over Roma on Friday . Solanke has scored 11 UEFA Youth League games during Chelsea's route to the final in Nyon, Switzerland . REMIND ME, WHAT IS THE UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE? In a nutshell, it's the Champions League - but for Under 19 teams. In its second season, the Youth League was created by UEFA to enable up-and-coming players in Europe's leading academies to gain valuable experience of playing in continental competition. The group phase runs in parallel with its big brother, with the same 32 teams as in the Champions League matched in the same groups. The main difference is that the knockout rounds are single-legged and the semi-finals and final in the same place over the course of one weekend. SO, WHERE IS THAT? Monday's final will be played at the Stade Colovray, which is situated in the shadow of UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. It's a pleasant spot, overlooking Lake Geneva, and is the home of Stade Nyonnais, who play in the Swiss third tier. It's capacity is 7,200 and pretty big crowds were there enjoying the sunshine and the football in Friday's semi-finals. WHEN IS THE GAME AND CAN I WATCH IT? It will kick-off at 3pm UK time and the match is live on British Eurosport. WHO WON THE COMPETITION LAST YEAR? The maiden winners of the Youth League were Barcelona, who defeated Benfica 3-0 in a one-sided final. The goals came from Rodrigo and a double from Munir El Haddadi, the competition's top goalscorer with 11 and now a member of the first-team squad. There was no English representation in the last four, though both Chelsea and Manchester City had made it to the quarter-finals. HOW HAVE THE BRITISH CLUBS DONE THIS YEAR? Chelsea, obviously, have made it all the way. Manchester City went out to Roma in the last eight, while both Arsenal and Liverpool tumbled out at the last 16 stage. Arsenal lost 1-0 to Atletico Madrid and Liverpool were beaten 2-1 by Benfica. ALL HOPES WITH CHELSEA THEN? Yes, and they will enter Monday's match as the marginal favourites. It is well-established that the Stamford Bridge academy is one of the best in England and last season saw the Under 21 team claim the Premier League title and the Under 18s win the FA Youth Cup. They will take on Manchester City in this season's Youth Cup final, too, over the next couple of weeks, their fifth final in six seasons. Having missed out on the NextGen Series title to Aston Villa two years ago, this is an excellent opportunity to assert their claim as one of Europe's best academies too. Chelsea's Isaiah Brown (left) tussle for the ball with Roma's Silvio Anocic (right) in the box . WHO HAVE THEY BEATEN TO GET THIS FAR? The Blues made a statement of intent in the group phase, winning five of their six matches and racking up 24 goals in the process. Slovenians Maribor were beaten 2-0 at home and 7-0 away, while Sporting Lisbon suffered 5-0 and 6-0 drubbings. Germans Schalke, who knocked Chelsea out last season, were beaten 4-1 before managing to win 2-0 at home. Chelsea then overcame Russians Zenit St Petersburg 3-1 in the last 16 courtesy of goals from Dominic Solanke, Kasey Palmer and Charlie Colkett. Atletico Madrid were then seen off 2-0 at Cobham in the quarters, with an own goal and another from Solanke securing their passage to Switzerland. But their most impressive performance came in the semi-final with Roma on Friday as a flurry of second-half goals from Colkett, Solanke (2) and Tammy Abraham left Roma in ruins. Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek (right) and Roma's Jose Machin (left) battle for the ball on Monday . WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? Coach Viveash was effusive about his team's qualities after their drubbing of Roma, telling Uefa.com: 'I'm very proud – proud of the players, proud of the staff who have worked very hard to get to this stage. When you see players perform like that it brings warmth to your heart. 'I feel very proud to work with that calibre of player and to watch them play is wonderful for everyone who works in our academy. They were excellent from minute one to minute 94 and thoroughly deserve their place in the final.' Tournament top scorer Solanke, who took his season's tally to 11 Youth League goals with a brace, added: 'I'm over the moon. We had quite a difficult journey yesterday because our flight was cancelled, so we had to get on with it today. It's amazing to reach the final. 'It's such a big tournament containing some of the best teams in the world. The level has gone up in the knockout games, but we've stepped things up as well and managed to reach the final.' WHO IS THE COACH? Adi Viveash is a former defender who played for Swindon Town, Walsall and Reading in the Football League during an 18-year playing career. He joined Chelsea's academy in 2008, starting with the Under 12 team and working his way up. In July 2011, he was appointed Under 18 coach and led the team to two FA Youth Cup triumphs in three seasons. Viveash stepped up to take charge of the under 21 team this season and doubles up to lead the under 19 side in the Youth League. MEET THE PLAYERS .

"Whether it is through Sir Bradley Wiggins, Geraint Thomas or Ian Stannard, Ireland's classics king Sean Kelly believes the time has come for Team Sky to break their duck in one of cycling's Monuments. With the two major cobbled classics - the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix - looming large over the next two weekends, it is time to see the early results of Sir Dave Brailsford's move to put more emphasis on the Spring Classics in his second five-year plan for Team Sky. With Wiggins electing to sign off his Team Sky career with an appearance at Paris-Roubaix on April 12, the races are bound to be a big part of the team's season whatever the outcome. British Bradley Wiggins competes during the  the Gent-Wevelgem one day cycling race on March 29 . The shift in emphasis has already paid dividends in the early part of the season, with Stannard defending his title at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Team Sky's third victory in the Belgian race, while Thomas last week won E3 Harelbeke - a key warm-up for this weekend's Tour of Flanders. Kelly, whose record of nine Monument wins puts him in a tie for third all-time, likes what he sees from Team Sky as the big races approach. 'Right now they're looking really good,' Kelly said. 'They've been very impressive in the semi-classics. Can they finish it off by winning a big one?' Team Sky's focus on the Grand Tours up to now has left them short of riders equipped to win classics, while the usually chaotic nature of the races is anathema to their favoured controlling tactics. But the development of Stannard and Thomas gives Team Sky two in-house contenders, while Wiggins raised eyebrows with his ninth-placed finish in Paris-Roubaix last year and he vowed to return. Luke Rowe could also be another British option for the team. Ian Stannard (3rd from front) rides in the Gent-Wevelgem one-day cycling race on March 29 . Injuries to classics specialists Fabian Cancellara (Trek Factory) and Tom Boonen (Etixx-QuickStep) - although the latter may return in time for Paris-Roubaix - add to the impression that Team Sky's best chance may be now. 'Without Cancellara, without Boonen, it's going to be a more open race,' said Kelly, who will commentate on both the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix for Eurosport. 'There's going to be eight-10 guys saying they can win and Sky have three of them. Geraint is certainly in there, Stannard is maybe a little bit under his best after his crash (in the first Monument, Milan-San Remo on March 22) but can come back, and then of course there is Wiggins.' Of the three, Wiggins is yet to show the sort of form this season which suggests he can win Paris-Roubaix, but Kelly is not counting the 2012 Tour de France winner out, saying a Monument win to add to his Tour and world time trial success would elevate Wiggins to 'another level'. 'If you look at the way he's performing at the moment, for me, it's not as good as I would like him to be in the recent races, but you can't go to Paris-Roubaix with only one card to play,' Kelly said. Geraint Thomas celebrates placing third in the Belgian cycling classic Ghent-Wevelgem . 'With Thomas and Stannard as well, you play all of those cards and the rest look after them. If you can get to the final 10-12km and Wiggins is still there, that is where he can go on the attack.' To get to that point, Team Sky will need to be in survival mode in a usually attritional race known as 'the Hell of the North'. The brutal cobbled stretches, which require huge amounts of effort while increasing the chances of crashes and mechanical problems, create a nervousness in the peloton which makes planning all but impossible. Although Kelly never won the Tour of Flanders, finishing second in 1984, he was victorious in Paris-Roubaix twice, 1984 and 1986, and said the fear of the cobbles is something that never really left him. 'When I first went there I had a horrendous time - I was very nervous on the cobbles and I wasn't able to ride them well,' he said. 'I slowly developed and I was able to manage to ride them, but even when I got to the point of being a Paris-Roubaix favourite it's still very nervous times. 'It's a horrible race to ride, but a great race to win.'","Team Sky have never won one of cycling's five Monument races .

"Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has a Premier League win ratio of 91.7 per cent - the highest of any player to have made at least 10 appearances. Following the Gunners' 1-0 win against Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday, the Colombia international took his tally to 11 wins from 12 games since he displaced Wojciech Szczesny as No 1 in January. Ospina has kept six clean sheets in those 12 games with his only defeat coming against Tottenham in the north London derby on February 7 to boast an impressive win percentage. But who else makes the top 10? Ospina has the highest win ratio of any Premier League player to make more than 10 appearances . The Arsenal goalkeeper has won 11 of his 12 games in the league since displacing Wojciech Szczesny . Former Manchester City defender Stefan Savic (right) won 10 of his 11 games in the league before being sold . Former Manchester City defender Stefan Savic, who was deemed not good enough after making just 11 Premier League appearances before being sold to Fiorentina, is second behind Ospina. The Montenegro international has a win ratio of 90.9 per cent after appearing on the losing side just once during his only season with the Premier League champions. Gerard Pique, who spent four years at Manchester United, makes up the top three after winning 10 of his 12 Premier League games before rejoining Barcelona and going on to win countless trophies, including a World Cup with Spain. Gerard Pique made 12 Premier League appearances for Manchester United, winning 10 of them . Arjen Robben posts an impressive 82.1 per cent win ration in the Premier League from 67 matches . Asier del Horno won 20 times during his only season in the Premier League with Chelsea in 2005-06 . Arjen Robben has arguably the most impressive stats of any player on the list for the number of appearances he made for Chelsea during a three-year spell. The Bayern Munich winger was on the winning side an incredible 55 times from his 67 games giving him a win ration of 82.1 per cent. Another former Chelsea player Asier del Horno is fifth on the list with 80 per cent and is followed by current Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin with 78.6. Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin (left) has won 11 of his 14 league games this season . Manchester United forward James Wilson has won 10 of 13 appearances in the league . Igor Stepanov made 17 appearances for Arsenal in the early 2000s and won 13 matches . Manchester United's 19-year-old striker James Wilson has only failed to be on the winning side three times from his 13 appearances putting him seventh on the list, while former Arsenal defender Igor Stepanovs' 76.5 per cent is enough to put him eighth. Nacho Monreal, currently preferred to Kieran Gibbs as Arsenal left back, has won 43 games from his 57 appearances for Arsene Wenger's side. United defender Paddy McNair sneaks into the top 10 with 75 per cent having featured 12 times under Louis van Gaal this season, winning nine. When did Ospina join Arsenal? Arsenal signed Ospina from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The 26-year-old made close to 200 appearances for the French club during six seasons. How much did Arsenal pay for him? Originally signed as back-up and competition for Wojciech Szczesny after the Gunners No 2 Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea, Ospina cost a paltry £3million. Is he of international calibre? Ospina had won 52 caps for Colombia and impressed during their run to the World Cup quarter-final in Brazil last summer. When did Ospina make his first appearance for Arsenal? Ospina made his debut for Arsenal in a 2-1 defeat by Southampton in the third round of the Capital One Cup back in September and only made one further appearance in the Champions League before 2015. When did he displace Wojciech Szczesny as No 1? Ospina was recalled to the starting line-up as Arsenal beat Hull 2-0 in the FA Cup third round in January after Szczesny was at fault for both goals during a 2-0 defeat by Southampton. It later emerged that the Poland goalkeeper was caught smoking in the showers after the game. Ospina kept his place for the league game the following week and has played every Premier League match since. Did you know...

"He was, as one ECB board member put it, just too accident-prone for a role that has seen him flounder in the face of the bitter fallout from an Ashes whitewash. Paul Downton was brave enough to make huge decisions in his first 14 months as England’s managing director but the jury is still out on all of them at a time as the clamour for change has grown louder. It was Downton who made the big call to sack Kevin Pietersen and reappoint Peter Moores as England coach. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . The move came a day ahead of an ECB board meeting that was meant to discuss the future of Downton . OCTOBER 2013 . Downton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014. FEBRUARY 2014 . After the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked. After days of silence, the official line on Pietersen’s dismissal is that the ECB wanted to ‘create a culture’ in which captain Alastair Cook had ‘the full support of all players’. MARCH 2014 . England suffer a humiliating 45-run defeat to Holland in the World T20. Ravi Bopara top-scored for England with just 18. APRIL 2014 . Downton appoints Peter Moores, who had spent the previous four seasons as head coach at Lancashire, for a second spell as England head coach. MAY 2014 . Downton and the ECB issue an apology to Pietersen for claiming he appeared ‘disinterested’ and ‘distracted’ during the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney. JUNE 2014 . England lose a Test series at home to Sri Lanka. The south Asian side had previously won on English soil in 1998 — in a one-off Test match. JULY-AUG 2014 . England lose the second Test against India, but come back to win the home series 3-1. In the fifth Test, England inflict upon India their third heaviest defeat in history. DECEMBER 2014 . Cook is sacked as one-day captain and replaced by Eoin Morgan, marking the end of a sorry year for England in which they won just 18 of their 48 matches across all formats. FEBRUARY-MARCH 2015 . England endure a dreadful World Cup campaign, failing to advance from the group stage and finishing behind Bangladesh, who sealed their exit with a 15-run victory. APRIL 2015 . Downton departs as ECB managing director. The ECB are to create a new role of ‘director of England Cricket’ ahead of the Ashes series. He also had to back the decision to replace Alastair Cook as one-day captain on the brink of the World Cup even though it was the selectors who drove it. But, most of all, it is England’s humiliating World Cup that led the 14 members of the ECB management board to unanimously back the sacking of Downton when new chief executive Tom Harrison rang them on Wednesday morning. So acute was the embarrassment at England going out in the first round of the World Cup that any hopes Downton had for an extended stay in office proved impossible. To the new regime he had to go. ‘Hugh Morris (his predecessor) stayed in the background but Paul became far too high-profile,’ one board member told Sportsmail on Wednesday night. ‘He was always on the outfield before games. The bottom line is that he was just too accident prone.’ Downton is the most high-profile casualty so far of that new broom sweeping through English cricket, led by Harrison and chairman-elect Colin Graves but he will not be the last, unless England are successful in their busiest of all years. James Whitaker, the national selector, is the most vulnerable, not least because a change of job description for Downton’s successor to director of England cricket looks likely to make the new man an all-round supremo. Moores and captain Alastair Cook now need to beat the West Indies in the three-Test series starting in Antigua on Monday if they are to feel secure. They must then carry on winning when they face New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa over the next 10 months in Test cricket alone. Whether this makes a difference to Pietersen’s future remains to be seen. Clearly the removal of the man who sacked him and an ECB chairman Giles Clarke who was firmly against Pietersen must increase the odds on one of the most unlikely comebacks in sport history happening this summer. Much may depend on who replaces Downton because there is still no real appetite within the ECB, and certainly not among senior members of the England team, for Pietersen to return. His best chance may be if Michael Vaughan is appointed by a man he is known to be close to in Graves. The former England captain  said on Wednesday that he would like to talk to the ECB about the role. Vaughan was the England captain who brought the best from Pietersen, admittedly when he was young and far less likely to cause trouble, and has made no secret of his encouragement for his return. Yet Vaughan, a constant critic of Downton and Moores, has a myriad of interests, both cricketing and otherwise, that he presumably must shelve if he is to return to the ECB now. A more likely scenario is for another former England captain in Andrew Strauss to take up a role that would appear made for him. There were many at the ECB who wanted Strauss to succeed Morris, not least the Welshman himself, but he ruled it out at the time, saying it was too soon after the end of his playing career. Since then he has dabbled in commentary with Sky but may now think the time is right for what seems a natural progression to administration. Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing . Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . Former England captain Michael Vaughan  said on Wednesday he would like to talk to the ECB about the role . Kevin Pietersen (left) could return for England while Andrew Strauss (right) is another that could take the role . Pietersen was uncharacteristically coy when asked on Twitter for his thoughts on Downton’s departure . Alec Stewart is another candidate who, presumably, would have a more open mind about recalling Pietersen as he has just re-signed him for Surrey. He is the third man on the most likely three-man short-list. The best brains in English cricket are undoubtedly Hussain and Atherton so Harrison and Graves should be doing all they possibly can to encourage one of them to return to the national cause. Hussain has already refused and it is extremely unlikely Atherton would be tempted either. Downton has become a derided character but he does not deserve to be the figure of ridicule he has become as frustration has grown at the national team. He was a respected wicketkeeper-batsman with England who had to play much of his Test cricket against the West Indies at their peak and was widely admired for his bravery and gutsy character. His return to cricket after a career in the City came at a time when Morris assured him that everything was in place for a bright future. England’s catastrophic collapse in Australia changed everything. The decision to ditch Pietersen was, as far as I am concerned, absolutely right while Moores may yet prove to be the coach Downton and others believe him to be. But a fall-guy was needed for the World Cup and Downton was the obvious candidate. It remains to be seen how many follow.

Moores (from left to right), Downton and England captain Alastair Cook during the press conference . Downton speaks with Sir Ian Botham  at Lord's Cricket Ground on May 31, 2014 . Meanwhile, here in Basseterre, Jonny Bairstow picked a bad day to remind England that he is a player of real potential despite being jettisoned after the winter’s Ashes disaster. England’s decision to turn their second warm-up game into a practice session saw Bairstow, Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance and Joe Root bat for an extremely weak St Kitts Invitational XI against their own team. Trott fell third ball to Jimmy Anderson, fending a ball outside off stump to third slip, while Ballance still looked out of touch in being dismissed for 17. Yet Bairstow, the back-up keeper on this tour, made the most of his chance to score 98 before falling to the impressive Ben Stokes. There was an early worry when Stuart Broad slipped in his delivery stride and fell clutching his ankle. He went off for treatment but later returned to bowl and looked no worse for the accident. Root was also struck flush on the helmet fielding at short leg but came out later to bat for St Kitts. England will bat for the whole of Thursday before leaving for Monday’s first Test in Antigua. Alastair Cook . Downton was a supporter of Cook as Test captain but was persuaded to sack him as one-day captain three weeks before the disastrous World Cup campaign. The new ‘Director of England cricket’ might think Cook needs to go back to scoring runs at the top of the order after failing to convince as a tactician . Verdict: Vulnerable . Alastair Cook was suppoerted by Downton before being sacked as one-day captain before the World Cup . James Whitaker . The chairman of selectors and former Leicestershire captain has been involved in one of the grimmest periods in English cricket. Selections have been difficult to fathom at times and a series of well-publicised clangers have alienated the selector from players, spectators and media . Verdict: Sure to follow Downton out the door . England selector James Whitaker (left) and former managing director Downton during a nets session . Peter Moores . An atrocious World Cup heaped even more pressure on the coach, whose reappointment last year by Downton has been mitigated only by last summer’s Test series win against India. Described as ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’ by Downton, Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been. Verdict: Vulnerable . Peter Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been following Downton's dismissal at the ECB . Kevin Pietersen . It is almost inconceivable that barely six months after publishing one of the most vitriolic books in the history of sport, this high-maintenance player could be on the brink of a return. But Downton’s removal, and Giles Clarke’s departure, means the path is now clear for Pietersen if he scores runs for Surrey. Verdict: Return possible . Kevin Pietersen's path is now clear to return if he scores runs for Surrey and he tweeted just as much .","Paul Downton was swept aside as managing director on Wednesday .

The 14-time major champion is bidding to win his fifth green jacket, but has been plagued by a succession of injuries and even the chipping yips in recent times. The world will find out which version of Woods will turn up when he tees off in the penultimate group at 6.48pm. Defending champion Bubba Watson, hoping to win his third Masters title in four years, will tee off at 2.24pm alongside England's former US Open champion Justin Rose and 21-year-old South Korean amateur Gunn Yang, who earned the right to play in the prestigious group by winning the US Amateur last year. Those watching the 2.02pm group on Thursday could see some fireworks as two of the game's most colourful characters go head-to-head. Ian Poulter could hardly be described as a shrinking violet, but even he might meet his match in American young gun Patrick Reed, who earned himself a brash reputation by professing himself to be among the top five players in the world after his big win at Doral last year. He followed that up by shushing the home crowd during a cocksure display at Gleneagles. Three-time Masters champion Phil MIckelson, hitting from behind trees during practice, will play alongside McIlroy in the first two rounds . Ryan Moore, pictured during a practice round at Augusta, will join McIlroy and Mickelson on the course for round one and two . Woods will be accompanied with Wales' Jamie Donaldson and Jimmy Walker of the USA during the first two rounds of the competition . US Open champion Martin Kaymer is in the group behind world No 1 McIlroy, with Brandt Snedeker and Houston Open winner JB Holmes. McIlroy and Mickelson were among the players battling for the US PGA title in near-darkness at Valhalla last year, with Mickelson and Rickie Fowler stepping aside on the 18th to allow the final group of McIlroy and Bernd Wiesberger to tee off and beat the fading light. With 98 players in the field, Charley Hoffman and Brian Harman make up the first group out in the tournament proper at 12.45pm (7:45am local time), with Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus again acting as honorary starters five minutes earlier, the legendary duo hitting tee shots on the par-four first before retiring to the clubhouse while Arnold Palmer takes up a similar role but is unable to tee off as he is recovering from a dislocated shoulder. England's Danny Willett will begin his Masters debut in the second group at 12:56pm alongside 1987 winner Larry Mize and US amateur public links champion Byron Meth. Woods faces a lengthy wait before he can begin his bid for a fifth Masters title after being drawn in the penultimate group for the opening round. The American superstar has started just two events in 2015, carding a career-worst 82 to miss the cut in the first and withdrawing through injury after 11 holes of the second, but said he was ready to 'compete to win a golf tournament' after 11 holes of practice on Monday. The final group tees off at 1:59pm and features three players ranked in the top 13 in the world, Australia's Jason Day, Spain's Sergio Garcia and Fowler. Fowler finished in the top five in all four majors last year.","The 79th Masters Tournament starts on Thursday at Augusta National .

"Chelsea match-winner Cesc Fabregas hailed a vital win after his late goal gave his side a 1-0 victory over QPR at Loftus Road. The game looked to be heading for a stalemate before Fabregas' 88th minute shot - their first on target in the game - found its way past Rob Green. The win moved Jose Mourinho's men seven points clear at the top of the table and Fabregas admitted it was an important goal. Midfielder Cesc Fabregas runs away in celebration having scored a vital winner in the 88th minute . 'It was vital. We know that we are playing for the most important trophy of the season,' the midfielder told Sky Sports. 'We're there in first place and we want to continue that.'

It was a tough game but the good thing with this team is we always play to the end.' Mourinho knew the win moved his side one step closer to a fifth league title, despite them having to work hard for it. 'Our situation was very positive. One point would be one less point we need, but the reality is that three points is always three points and one less match we need to win so is a very important step in a very important match,' he said. Nemanja Matic hugs his goalscoring team-mate Fabregas after the final whistle at Loftus Road . 'It was a very difficult match where the best quality was to control the game very well and stop our opponents scoring. 'They are a team that can score goals and have dangerous, attacking players so our best quality in the game was to keep calm and try to play against a team that was very well organised defensively and did a fantastic job,' added Mourinho. 'After that you have lots of times in the season when you win points or lose points in the end of the game, and we won two points in the last two minutes.'

"Jolyon Palmer is determined to claim a place in Formula One next year after being given the perfect opportunity by Lotus to prove himself worthy. For the first time the Enstone-based marque are providing their test and reserve driver with a number of outings in Friday's first practice session ahead of grand prix weekends. Ordinarily in the past, Lotus' reserve has been nothing more than a spare part, stood on the sidelines whilst the race drivers completed their tasks. Jolyon Palmer will drive in every Friday practice session for Lotus this season . This year, however, Lotus have decided Palmer will get a shot, and not just as a driver doing all the donkey work too. Every Friday Palmer will be behind the wheel - as was the case in China last week and again in Bahrain this week - his run-plan will be similar to that of whoever he replaces. In China, Palmer was only 0.6secs behind Pastor Maldonado at the end of FP1, a tremendous effort given it was Palmer's first major outing at an F1 event. If Palmer can continue to push, or even on occasion better the times of Maldonado and team-mate Romain Grosjean, doors may open. 'I want to be really pushing the race drivers. That's the aim,' said Palmer. 'I'm pretty much running on the same run plan as those guys. It's not like we've seen in FP1 sessions before with other drivers where they have been on quali settings, engine turned up or low fuel. 'This year there's a direct comparison and I want to show why I should be racing next year.' Unfortunately for last year's GP2 champion, his lack of competitive work outside of his duties with Lotus may prove a hindrance. Palmer drives  during practice for the Chinese Grand Prix last weekend . The 24-year-old from Horsham would love to be keeping his hand in, but knows it is something he has to sacrifice to keep his F1 dream alive. 'I want to race, but only if I get the right offer,' added Palmer, son of former F1 driver Jonathan. 'If I get a good offer to do something that would be a good career move for me then I'd like to race. 'It's about keeping sharp. It's the one thing I'm missing this year. 'I'm loving working with Lotus and being in F1, but I'd love to be racing as well, so if I get a good offer I'd love to.' Palmer, though, is not actively seeking further employment because of his commitment to Lotus, adding: 'My main focus is all here and I'm really busy anyway. 'If something came my way then I would definitely consider it, but my main priority is Lotus and I will not compromise anything I do here by racing elsewhere. 'But if there is something that came along that could fit in with this then I'd be happy to do it.'","Jolyon Palmer will drive in every Friday practice session for Lotus .

"Kawhi Leonard matched his career best with 26 points and set a new career-high with seven steals as the San Antonio Spurs rolled past Golden State 107-92 on Sunday, ending the Warriors' 12-game winning streak while extending their own to seven straight. San Antonio also extended their home winning streak over Golden State to 32 straight, dating back to 1997, the season before Duncan arrived. Tim Duncan had 19 points and Danny Green added 18 points for San Antonio, who led by as many as 28 points. Kawhi Leonard was in exceptional form as the San Antonio Spurs defeated Golden State Warriors 107-92 . Leonard reaches for the basket during the Spurs win - he scored a career-high 26 points in the success . Leonard's heroics inspired the Spurs to their 32nd consecutive home win over the Warriors . 'Kawhi was magnificent at both ends of the court,' San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. 'He is really playing confidently, but he hasn't forgotten to predicate his game on defense and on the boards. It kind of fuels him offensively.' Stephen Curry had 24 points, but was harassed into 9-for-17 shooting by Leonard. Klay Thompson was held to six points for Golden State. 'This is the first time I think since Christmas that we haven't really been in a game,' Curry said. 'We'll be fine going forward.' Stephen Curry (right), seen here taking on Tony Parker, scored 24 points for the Warriors . The roles are reversed as Parker drives against Curry during a San Antonio attack . In other games, Indiana got injured star Paul George back just in time, beating Miami 112-89 to remain in contention for the play-offs. Houston overcame Russell Westbrook's 11th triple-double of the season to beat Oklahoma City 115-112, and LeBron James recorded his first triple-double since returning to Cleveland to lift the Cavaliers over Chicago 99-94. George finished with 13 points in 15 minutes - his first action for the Pacers since breaking his right leg on August 1.

"Jordan Spieth believes he will be better equipped to cope with the pressure of trying to win the Masters after coming close to creating history last year. Spieth held a two-shot lead after seven holes of the final round 12 months ago as he looked to surpass the absent Tiger Woods as the youngest ever Masters champion, as well as being the first player to win on their tournament debut since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979. That lead became a two-shot deficit as he bogeyed the eighth and ninth and Bubba Watson birdied the same holes, Watson eventually going on to win his second green jacket in the space of three years. Jordan Spieth plays a shot during a practice round at Augusta on Tuesday as he gears up for the Masters . Spieth believes he is better equipped to win the first major of the year after coming close on his debut in 2014 . The 21-year-old skims a ball across a lake at Augusta during a relaxed practice round . Spieth finished joint second with Sweden's Jonas Blixt and comes into this year's event having won his second PGA Tour title in the Valspar Championship and finishing second in his next two tournaments. Speaking about last year's final round, the 21-year-old said: 'That was definitely the highest amount of pressure I've ever felt. That first tee shot, I think I hit it into the ninth fairway and was just real quick off the tee. Played pretty much the entire round feeling different than I've ever felt on the golf course. 'I enjoyed it, but at the same time when you're feeling that kind of pressure, it's hard to get comfortable picking fearless shots, and then I kind of bailed out on a couple of swings, trying to look up a little quickly. 'I guess the hardest lesson taken from last year was that I had an opportunity to make a dream come true, and I had it in my hands, and then I was just a little anxious. You can make the excuse that as a first-timer and 20 years old, that that's likely to happen. Spieth, pictured in action at last year's Masters, threw away a two-shot lead to finish joint second in 2014 . Bubba Watson hugs Spieth after tapping in to win his second green jacket at Augusta last year . 'But in my mind, I was playing the best through 61 holes and had an opportunity to continue that the next 11 holes and didn't quite close it out.' Spieth, who has been paired with Henrik Stenson and Billy Horschel for the first two rounds, added: 'Last year I remember being in here saying I had no expectations, didn't know what it was going to be like, never played the tournament before. 'This year, I come in maybe expecting to play well on a course I feel very comfortable on. I feel like it suits my game nicely and also I feel like I've been playing well. 'Having been so close last year and having a little experience and riding some momentum, I hope to put myself in contention and use what I've learned since last year. 'I think last year's event, I certainly took a couple things out of it, as well as the positives that came from closing out a couple of tournaments at the end of the year and a few weeks ago.'","Jordan Spieth finished joint second on his Masters debut last year .

"Marcelo insists Real Madrid's this season's meetings with local rivals Atletico Madrid will have no bearing on the outcome of their Champions League quarter-final tie. The reigning champions face Diego Simeone's side at Vicente Calderon on Tuesday night in the first leg of the last eight clash having failed to beat their neighbours in six attempts this season. Carlo Ancelotti's side lost both La Liga matches against Atletico this season - 2-1 at the Bernabeu before a humiliating 4-0 away defeat - and have also been beaten twice and held to two draws in the Spanish Supper Cup and the Copa del Rey. Marcelo says Real Madrid's failure to beat Atletico in six attempts this season will have no affect on their Champions League quarter-final tie . Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo looked relaxed in training on Monday ahead of Tuesday's first leg . Brazil international Marcelo faces the media on Monday ahead of Tuesday's match at Vicente Calderon . But Brazil international Marcelo says he and his team-mates are not thinking about their recent form against Tuesday's opponents. 'We have played against Atletico a lot and something always changes,' Marcelo told reporters at a press conference on Monday. There are no favourites in a match like this. We will give everything on the pitch without thinking about previous games.' 'They are a great team. They never stop fighting and they are very intense. But we are not thinking about the last games against them. Now is completely different. We have two games to show that we can beat them.' Ronaldo and Bale leave the field dejected after Real Madrid were beaten 4-0 by Atletico in February . The last time Real Madrid beat their local rivals was in the Champions League final last season . Carlo Ancelotti and Marcelo task questions at the pre-match press conference . 'We have to go out and give everything on the pitch this time. We will have to be very intense. We will have to fight. These derbies are very difficult.' The last time Real beat Atletico was in last season's Champions League final when Sergio Ramos scored in the 93rd minute to take the game to extra-time, before Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo made it 4-1. 'I don't know how many times we have spoken about Ramos' Decima goal this week,' Marcelo added. 'I was available for the final and I never lost faith in helping the team. That's what happened and I was able to help the team win the Champions League. I consider myself very important in this team.'","Real Madrid haven't beaten local rivals Atletico in six attempts this season .

"North vs South - it's perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of England and this week we've started a fresh debate based on football. We have assembled two dream teams - one featuring players from the Premier League clubs in the South of England and the other featuring Northern-based stars. On Monday, Rob Draper revealed who he'd select in the Southern XI and on Tuesday, Joe Bernstein did likewise for the North. We then sent the All-star teams to our friends at Football Manager, who have simulated the match. Here's what happened... So, now we know: the South has the edge over the North for footballing talent. Alexis Sanchez and Harry Kane were the heroes as the Southern All-Stars came out on top in our simulated clash between the Premier League's best players from the North and South. Despite falling behind less than a minute into the game to a stunning finish from Sergio Aguero, who was supported up front by Wayne Rooney, the Southern XI were able to mount a fightback with a brace from Sanchez either side of Harry Kane's second-half goal. SCROLL DOWN TO WATCH A VIDEO OF THE SIMULATED MATCH . Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal (left) starred in our simulated All-Star game, while Spurs striker Harry Kane (right) also scored in the match . Manchester City hotshot Sergio Aguero gave the Northern combined XI the lead after less than a minute, but his team were still beaten . The Southern All-Stars boasted Harry Kane up front while the Northern side was led by Sergio Aguero and Wayne Rooney . The Southerners saw less of the ball and created fewer chances but were more clinical in front of goal than the Northern All-Stars, who twice hit the woodwork. After Aguero's early strike, the South battled back and went close through Morgan Schneiderlin and John Terry. Their pressure was rewarded when Sanchez linked up with Kane and buried his shot  from inside the area. Kane added his name to the scoresheet in the second half with a well-taken finish following some lovely build-up play by Eden Hazard, Santi Cazorla and Schneiderlin. Sanchez then rounded off the victory with a clinical, powerful effort 20 minutes from time. The Northern team were made to rue missed opportunities after creating three clear-cut chances to the South's two but didn't convert them . Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez is the stand-out in Football Manager's player ratings with 6.1 while Martin Skrtel was least effective for the North . The Northerners enjoyed marginally more possession than their rivals and won 13 corners but failed to kick on after Aguero's opener . The Southerners’ manager Rob Draper will be delighted by his team's smooth transitions from defence to attack, and their elaborate passing play in the middle of the park. It could well have been a different story, however, had Joe Bernstein's Northern side been able to convert their chances. Martin Skrtel will be unhappy with his performance in the centre of defence too. The men in red looked threatening on the flanks, particularly through Raheem Sterling, but far too often they failed to capitalise on his excellent service. Aguero conspired to miss from six yards out when unmarked in injury-time to sum up their profligacy. That meant a comfortable margin of victory by two goals for the Southern All-Stars and bragging rights over their Northern neighbours. But, somehow, we suspect the old debate over which half of England reigns supreme will continue. MATCH HIGHLIGHTS (SCROLL DOWN TO WATCH A VIDEO OF THE SIMULATION) 1st minute: GOAL!!! The pre-match hype is immediately justified as Sergio Aguero picks up a short pass from James McCarthy, dribbles past Jose Fonte and curls the ball past Thibaut Courtois to make it 1-0 to the Northern All-Stars. Aguero (centre, in red) slots home the opening goal in the very first minute of the All-Stars clash . 8th minute: A Santi Cazorla corner finds the head of John Terry but his effort is fractionally too high. Santi Cazorla's pinpoint corner finds captain John Terry at the near post but the Chelsea legend's header clears the crossbar . 10th minute: Raheem Sterling forces Courtois into a decent save with a powerful effort from the edge of the area. 20th minute: A well-worked move by the Southern All-Stars culminates in a Morgan Schneiderlin volley from 25 yards that whistles over Joe Hart’s crossbar. 21st minute: A Cazorla free-kick is deflected out for a corner. The delivery from the Spaniard is poor and the Northern All-Stars break with Sterling. After beating two defenders, he elects to try and curl one in from the 18-yard mark but his effort drifts wide of the goal. 29th minute: GOAL!!! A misplaced pass from Aguero gives away possession when the Northern All-Stars look threatening. The Southern All-Stars take full advantage with a direct move down the right flank. The ball finds its way to Kane, who plays a pinpoint pass to Sanchez to calmly slot the ball into the bottom corner and level the match. Sanchez (top, in blue) slots past Joe Hart in the Northern XI's goal to score the equaliser . 36th minute: Some clever interplay between Rooney and Aguero opens up the Southern All-Star defence . 39th minute: More good play from Aguero and Rooney creates a half-chance for the Northern All-Stars but the Argentina striker drags his shot wide. Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin attempts an ambitious volley from 25 yards but it meets the same fate as Terry's header . HALF-TIME: Southern All-Stars 1-1 Northern All-Stars . Substitution: Michael Carrick is replaced by Yaya Toure. 46th minute: The Northern All-Stars very nearly take the lead straight from kick-off after more good work on the right from Sterling. He slips the ball into Rooney, whose shot is turned onto the post by Courtois. 57th minute: Substitution: David Silva makes way for Ashley Young. 60th minute: Substitution: Phil Jones replaces Ryan Shawcross after the Stoke man takes a knock from a robust Alexis Sanchez challenge. The Northern All-Stars have used all their substitutions. 66th minute: Double Substitution: Nathaniel Clyne and Nemanja Matic are subbed off for Branislav Ivanovic and Fabian Delph. Following the substitutions, the Northern All-Stars push forward with Toure giving the team more purpose in the middle of the park. Toure's raking through ball is met by Sterling who thinks he has made it 2-1 only for the linesman to raise his flag. 68th minute: GOAL!!! Courtois sends the resulting free-kick long and the Southern All-Stars work the ball to Schneiderlin on the edge of the area. His through ball to Kane is weighted to perfection and the striker races onto it before slotting home to put his team in front. Kane (second right, in blue) raises his arm in celebration after putting the Southern All-Stars in front for the first time . 72nd minute: GOAL!!! The Southern All-Stars wrap up the match with Sanchez’s second goal. More intricate build-up play in the midfield allows Sanchez to lose his man, take a touch and hit a powerful effort that beats Hart. Sanchez (bottom right, in blue) notches his second goal of the game to settle the contest at Wembley . 81st minute: From a throw-in on the left, Young feeds Aguero, who has acres of space ahead of him and men arriving in the box. He chooses to go it alone but Courtois makes a comfortable save down to his right. Aguero storms into the box and ignores support on his inside to take a shot from a tight angle, but it's easily saved by Thibaut Courtois . 83rd minute: A corner from the Northern All-Stars is only half cleared to Young but his shot is blasted into the side netting. 88th minute: The Northern All-Stars work an opening from a free-kick but Rooney’s effort is poor and straight at Courtois. 90+2: The simplest chance of the match falls to Aguero in injury-time after a superb low cross from Sterling. The Manchester City star is unmarked six yards out but can only hit the post. Rooney collects the ball and gets another shot away but Courtois palms it out for a corner. Aguero blows his chance to make the scoreline a little more respectable late on when he hits the upright after low cross from Sterling . 90+3: The resulting corner amounts to nothing and the referee blows the final whistle. FULL TIME: Southern All-Stars 3-1 Northern All-Stars .","Sportsmail has simulated an All-Star battle between the Premier League's best talent from North and South .
